<h3>Evolution And Philosophy</h3>

Constitution is the fundamental and organic
law of a nation, establishing the concepts,
character and organization of its Government
as well as prescribing the extent of Government,
sovereign power & manner of its exercise. It is
the supreme law of the land. All other laws &
customs in order to be legally valid must confirm
to the provisions of the Constitution.
It also possesses ideas and aspirations of the
people of a country. It enjoys special legal
sanctity. Organic law is the one that establishes
an administrative agency in the form of Union
and State Executive and Enjoys special legal
sanctity: because it derives it power and
authority from people directly. Other law enjoys
legal sanctity but not special sanctity. Thus,
Constitution is superior to all other laws. Other
laws stress their source to legislature. Parliament
draws authority from Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAKING OF THE CONSTITUTION</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Indian Constitution was adapted and
enacted by a Constituent Assembly
(CA), which was formed under Cabinet
Mission Plan, 1946.</li>
        <li>Members of CA were indirectly elected
by the members of the Provincial
Legislative Assembly (Lower House
only), in ratio of 1 member per 1 million
populations. Representation was also
given to Princely States.</li>
        <li>The seats in each province were
distributed among the three main
communities- Muslim, Sikh, and
General, in proportion to their
respective population.</li>
        <li>Members of each community in the
Provincial Legislative Assembly elected
their own representatives by the method
of proportional representation by means
of single transferable vote.</li>
        <li>CA, which had been elected for
undivided India held its first sitting on
9th December 1946. Out of total 389
members 296 were elected from British
Provinces and rest 93 were nominated
by Princely States.</li>
        <li>But as a result of the partition under
the Plan of June 3, 1947, a separate
Constituent Assembly was set up for
Pakistan. The representatives of Bengal,
Punjab, Sind, North-Western Frontier
Province, Baluchistan and Sylhet district
of Assam (which had joined Pakistan
by a referendum) ceased to be members
of the Constituent Assembly of India,
and there was a fresh election in the
new Provinces of West Bengal and East
Punjab.</li>
        <li>Hence, when the Constituent Assembly
reassembled on 31st October 1947, the
membership of the House was reduced
to 299.</li>
        <li>Of these 284 were actually present on
26th November 1949 and appended
their signatures to the Constitution as
finally passed.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PHILOSOPHIES IN THE
CONSTITUTION</i></strong></div>

The Preamble of the Indian Constitution is
the best part where we can find a glimpse of the
major philosophical influences guiding the
Constitution.
<br>
<br>
Regarded as an introduction or prelude to
the constitution, the Preamble is modeled on US’s
constitution Preamble. The Supreme Court says
that the Preamble is nothing but the theme of
the Constitution which is also said to be the
philosophy of the Constitution and this
philosophy is largely ‘co-terminus’ with the ideals
and aspirations of the people of India which were
basically drawn from the freedom movement of
India. The ‘ideals’ listed in the Preamble are
‘Sovereignty’ ‘Socialism’ ‘Secularism’
‘Democracy’ and ‘Republic’ while the aspirations
to be achieved are mentioned as ‘Justice’ ‘Liberty’
‘Equality’ and ‘Fraternity’. These ideals and
aspirations are however related to each other in
the sense that the ideals are more or less
established but aspirations are to be achieved by
applying the instruments of these ideals. Further
as there is no end to achievements, aspirations
are ever evolving goals and we have to constantly
strive for them.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ideals in the Preamble</i></strong></div>

The ideals listed in the Preamble mainly
constitute the essentials of an independent,
strong and welfare oriented State:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sovereignty: This is inspired mainly from
the concept of ‘State’ which is fundamental
to all civilizations thus is an attribute of the
State. This is denoted by the supreme
Important committees of the Constituent Assembly & their Chairman
Committee Chairman.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Steering Committee Dr Rajendra Prasad</li>
        <li>Rules of Procedure Committee Dr Rajendra Prasad</li>
        <li>Committee for Negotiating with States Jawaharlal Nehru</li>
        <li>Union Constitution Committee Jawaharlal Nehru</li>
        <li>Union Power Committee Jawaharlal Nehru</li>
        <li>Provincial Constitution Committee Sardar Patel</li>
        <li>Committee on Fundamental Rights & Minorities Sardar Patel</li>
        <li>Fundamental Rights Sub-Committee J.B. Kripalani</li>
        <li>Minorities Sub-Committee H.C. Mukherjee</li>
        <li>Committee to examine Draft Constitution Sri Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer</li>
        <li>Order of Business Committee K.M. Munshi</li>
        <li>House Committee Sitaramayya Pattabhi</li>
        <li>Ad-hoc committee on National Flag Dr Rajendra Prasad</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Composition of Drafting Committee</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Dr. B.R. Ambedkar (Chairman)</li>
        <li>N. Gopalaswami Ayyangar</li>
        <li>Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer</li>
        <li>K. M. Munshi</li>
        <li>Mohammed Sadullah</li>
        <li>B.L. Mittar (replaced by N. Madhav Rao)</li>
        <li>D.P. Khaitan (who died in 1948 and replaced by T.T. Krishnamachari)
political power of a state which is unlimited.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

It means the country does not acknowledge
any political power outside its boundaries
as supreme. Sovereignty means that the
country is supreme internally and
independent externally. In a democracy
sovereignty lies with the people.</li>
        <li>Socialism: The Constitution provides for
Fabian Socialism also called as democratic
socialism, rather than Marxian socialism,
and envisages to build a society on socialist
principles. The thrust over socialistic goals
placed in the Constitution is evident from
the provisions listed under the Directive
principles of State Policy. The ideal of
building a socialist society is the
fundamental principle behind the welfare
nature of the State.</li>
        <li>Secularism: A very important tenet of the
Indian Constitution, secularism in the
Indian context is different from the
common idea of secularism in the West. In
the Indian context it implies that the State
shall be neutral on religious questions but
shall be positively ‘a-religious’ in its
functioning. The term ‘a-religious’ implies
that the State shall be neither religious nor
anti-religious nor irreligious but only nonreligious. Secularism means that the State
does not recognize any particular state
religion instead it recognizes the rights of
all religions which have made India as their
home and their right to co-exist on the soil
of India. The concept is one of the stabilizing
factors which help our society to sustain
and perpetuate itself despite infinite
diversity.</li>
        <li>Democracy: The idea of democracy in its
representative sense as it exist in India
today, is mainly borrowed from the West
and owes its origin to the Magna Carta in
the English history. It implies that people
are paramount and the State exists for the
people, by the people and of the people.
People in India enjoy representative
democracy in India.</li>
        <li>Republic: One of the terms borrowed from
the French revolution and implies that the
head of the State in India shall be elected
for a fixed period of time.
Aspirations in the Preamble: Mainly
borrowed from the charter of the French
Revolution and the American Revolution. Four
of them are listed in the Preamble.</li>
        <li>Justice: It is a very wide term which implies
social, economic as well as political justice.
Article 326 which provides for universal
adult franchise or Article 19 which provides
for basic freedoms or the chapter on
fundamental rights provides for political
justice. Economic justice has to be achieved
by implementing the provisions of the
Directive Principles of State Policy over a
period of time while social justice is ensured
by provisions such as the Article 17 which
provides for a prohibition of practices like
untouchability.</li>
        <li>Liberty: It implies freedom from arbitrary
or undue restraints especially by the
government or the freedom to do what an
individual thinks is best for him, provided
he does not violate others’ rights. Therefore
liberty means responsibility as well. Liberty
is necessary for intellectual and mental
development of the citizens and is essential
for a democracy to function.</li>
        <li>Equality: Equality of status and opportunity
without discrimination to all citizens. This
aspect is enforced by provisions like the
Article 15 and 16 which promises equality
of opportunity to all citizens in matters of
public employment free from any kind of
discrimination on any grounds of caste,
religion, place of birth, gender, language,
ethnicity, etc.</li>
        <li>Fraternity: Sense of brotherhood which
should prevail among the people of India
and is essential for the promotion of
national integration and can be achieved
by providing secularism, justice, liberty,
democracy, equality, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Apart from these there are other important
inspirations to the Constitution as well. The
following list gives a non exhaustive account of
these features:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Government of India Act 1935:</b>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATURE OF THE INDIAN
CONSTITUTION</i></strong></div>

Nature of the Indian Constitution means
whether it is Federal, Unitary or Qausi-Federal.
Federal - There are two set of Government
at Central and Provincial level with clear
distribution of powers under a written
Constitution.
<br>
<br>
Unitary - Only one set of Government at the
Center; Provinces are only sub-ordinate of
Center. All power vested with the Center.
Quasi-Federal – Comprising features of both
federal and unitary government;
Constitution Drafting Committee headed by
Dr. Ambedkar called it federal. Supreme Court
also said it federal. Scholars like Apple
Alexander also described it federal. However,
western scholar led by Prof. Wheare called it
qausi-federal. On the other hand Prof. Tripathi
called it unitary. U.S. Constitution is the oldest
Federal constitution in the world, so scholars
keep it as a model of federal form of constitution.
Thus whether Indian Constitution is federal or
unitary is a question of degree and not of kind.
Therefore, whether it is federal or not is to be
decided by number of federal or unitary features
it contains.
<br>
<br>
Federal Features of the Indian Constitution:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Division of Powers: Existence of a dual
polity, which means existence of two
sets of government i.e. one at Center
(Union Government) and other at
Provincial level (State Governments).
Powers and authority is divided
between Central & State Governments.
Further, Center & State Governments
are not sub-ordinate to each rather they
are co-ordinate bodies, each originating
in and controlled by the Constitution.
Each one is independent in its allotted
sphere of activity.</li>
        <li>Supremacy of the Constitution: (Art 13
of the Indian Constitution explicitly
talks about its supremacy.) Supremacy
in the context of federation means it is
binding on Central as well as State
Governments. Neither Center nor State
Government alone is in a position to
amend constitutional provision
regarding separation of powers between
Center and States. It can be only
amended by joint effort of both the
Center and States Governments.</li>
        <li>Written Constitution: For clear
distribution of powers between Union
and States, a written Constitution is very
necessary.</li>
        <li>Rigidity of the Constitution: Provisions
of the Constitution that requires a
special procedure for amendment
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Arts. 53 & 54- Election of the President.</li>
        <li>Art. 73- Extent of Executive power of
the Union.</li>
        <li>Art. 162- Extent of Executive powers of
the States.</li>
        <li>Art. 241 – High Courts for Union
Territories</li>
        <li>Union Judiciary (Arts. 124-147)</li>
        <li>High Courts (Arts. 214-231)</li>
        <li>Legislative relationship between Center
and States (Arts. 245-255 & VIIth
Schedule)</li>
        <li>Representation of the States to Lok
Sabha and Rajya Sabha</li>
        <li>Art. 368- Procedure of Amendment to
the Constitution.
It is corollary of supremacy of the
Constitution.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>Authority of Courts:</b> It includes two
things:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Establishment of an authority
independent of Central and State
government to resolve any disputes that
may arise between Center and State or
among States on issues relating to
distribution of power.</li>
        <li>Courts shall be given power to finally
interpret the Constitution, which is
binding on both Center & States.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Indian Constitution bears all the above
federal features. However, on the basis of such
federal features can we conclude that Indian
Constitution is federal? That requires a close look
of certain unitary features in the Constitution.
Unitary features of Indian Constitution:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>States do not have separate
Constitution: Consequence of this fact
is single citizenship. State govt. cannot
confer special rights on its inhabitants
who are ordinarily residents of the
nation. It also meant that State
administration can be brought under
Centre under certain circumstances.</li>
        <li>Art. 352: It empowers the President to
proclaim a National Emergency under
certain circumstances. During such
Emergency, the provisions regarding
distribution of power between Center
and State remain suspended. Therefore,
Constitution starts functioning as if it is
unitary. Thus Constitution is designed
to function as a federal in ordinary
circumstance and unitary in extraordinary situations whereas in U.S. the
Constitution always works as federal.</li>
        <li>Art. 4: It empowers the Parliament to
change area, name and boundary of the
State even without the consent of the
State. So States do not enjoy the
territorial equality whereas in U.S. there
is territorial equitability among all units.</li>
        <li>VIIth Schedule: Distribution of legislative
subjects under VIIth Schedule are heavily
in favour of the Center [97 subjects in Union
List]. All most important legislative
subjects are under the Union List. All
taxes of importance are also in the Union
List. The Parliament has exclusive
legislative jurisdiction over subject under
Union List.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Most important subjects under Union List
are: Defence; Atomic Energy; Foreign Affairs;
War and Peace; Citizenship; Railways; Airways,
Air Craft, Air Navigation; Post & Telegraph;
Currency, Coinage and Foreign Exchange;
Reserve Bank of India; Inter-state Trade &
Commerce; Banking; Stock Exchages; All India
Services; Election to Parliament and State
Legislature; Union Duties & Taxes, etc.
On the other hand State List includes 61
subjects of local importance. In revenue matter
sales tax is the only important subject under State
List. Therefore, States are financially dependent
on Center.
<br>
<br>
Most important subjects under State List
are: Public Order; Police; Prisons and
Reformatories; Local Government; Public Health
& Sanitation; Fisheries; Market and Fairs;
Agriculture; State Taxes & Duties, etc.
But States also do not enjoy exclusive
legislative jurisdiction on the subjects placed
under State List. Parliament can legislate on
State List under 5 conditions.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Art. 249– If Rajya Sabha passes a
resolution supported by not less than
2/3 of its members present and voting,
it is necessary and expedient for the
Parliament to legislate on one or more
subject specified in State List in national
interest. Under such provision
Parliament has jurisdiction to legislate
on State List for a period of one year at
each time it passes such resolution.
Rajya Sabha can pass any number of
resolutions to this effect.</li>
        <li>Art. 250 - When National Emergency is
in force then Parliament assumes
concurrent legislative powers. Thus
State List becomes Concurrent List and
Union can legislate on State List.</li>
        <li>Art. 252 – When two or more States
passed resolutions authorizing
Parliament to legislate on one or more
subjects in State List then Parliament
shall have power to legislate. Law so,
passed shall be binding on States
concern. The laws will remain in
operation till it is repealed by
Parliament. For example, in 1976,
Punjab & Haryana Urban Land Ceiling
Regulation Act. (ULCRA-1976), it was
repealed in 1995.</li>
        <li>Art. 253 – Parliament can legislate on
State List in order to give effect to
international treaty or agreement even
against the wishes of the States.</li>
        <li>Art. 356.– When President’s Rule is
imposed in a State then President may
authorize Parliament to legislate on
subject under State List for the
concerned State.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Concurrent List:</b> Though Concurrent List
(includes 47 items) provides equal power to
Center and State, Parliament is prior and
superior. Although both Union and State can
enact law over Concurrent List, laws enacted
by Parliament prevail over State laws.
Most important subjects under Concurrent
List are: Criminal Law and Procedure; Civil
Procedure; Marriage and Divorce; Contracts;
Ports; Trusts and Trustees; Welfare of Labour
and Trade Union; Social Security; Economic and
Social Planning; Population Control and Family
Planning; Education; Forests and Wild Life, etc.
<br>
<br>
<b>Residuary Power:</b> (That is the power
to legislate with respect to any matter
not enumerated in any one of the three
Lists.) Art. 248 of the Constitution talk
about residuary power, which belongs
to the Center in India whereas in USA
it belongs to the State.
<br>
<br>
<b>Appointment of Governor:</b> Under Art.
155, Governors are appointed by the
President and holds office during the
pleasure of the President. President
need not have to consult the concerned
State while appointing the Governor.
Governor enjoys immense power
including discretionary powers
(Discretionary powers refer to power
exercised by head of the State without
advice of the Council of Ministers).
Besides, Governor is not accountable to
the State Legislature. He is only
accountable to the President. So by
controlling Governor, Centre can
influence State and even stall a Bill
passed by the State Legislative Assembly.
<br>
<br>
<b>Administrative Directions:</b> Under Arts.
256-257, Center can issue administrative
direction to the State indicating the
manner in which properties of railways
and means of communication shall be
maintained by State government. These
directions are binding on the State. If
States ignore it, Union can assume that
constitutional machinery has been
broken down in the State and therefore
it can proclaim Art 356 in that State.
<br>
<br>
<b>Financial Emergency:</b> Under Art 360,
Center can impose a Financial
Emergency and during such period
distribution of financial resources
between Center and State remains
suspended. President can direct the
State to carry out certain financial
discipline including reduction of salaries
of civil servants and Judges of Supreme
Court and High Courts. He also can
direct the Governors to reserve all
Financial Bills for his consent passed by
Legislative Assemblies of the States.
<br>
<br>
<b>Presence of All India Services:</b> Art 312
provides for an All India Services
including creation of new All India
Services e.g. IAS, IPS and IFS. Officers
of these three services can function
under both Center as well as State but
mostly work at State level. They occupy
the top civil post in the State
Government and carry out the
administration for the state. However,
they are recruited by Center and the
State governments have no disciplinary
control over them except suspending.
<br>
<br>
<b>Single Election Commission:</b> Election
Commission of India holds all elections
in whole India including Parliamentary
and State Legislative Assemblies
elections.
<br>
<br>
<b>Single Unified Judiciary:</b> There is a
single and unified judiciary in India
being the Supreme Court at the apex
level. Below the Supreme Court there
are High Courts in State level. However,
High Court Judges are appointed and
transferred by the President of India in
consultation with the Center.
<br>
<br>
<b>Amendments to Constitution:</b> Most of
the provisions of the Constitution are
amended by Parliament alone. States do
not play any significant role in
amendment procedure except some
special provisions.
<br>
<br>
<b>Unequal Representation of State in
Rajya Sabha:</b> States are represented in
the Rajya Sabha on the basis of their
population. So principle of equality of
States is not followed.
<br>
<br>
The above provisions clearly indicate that
Indian Constitution has a strong bias towards
the Center. Thus it can be concluded that India
is a federation having strong unitary character.
It is Federation Sui Genesis’ (Of its own kind).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE DOCTRINE OF THE ‘BASIC
STRUCTURE OF THE CONSTITUTION’</i></strong></div>

The process of evolution of this aspect
dawned with the opening of the Shankari Prasad
Vs Union of India case in 1951 in which the SC
held that the Parliament enjoyed two types of
legislative powers: ordinary legislative powers
and the constituent legislative powers. Further
any enactment passed by virtue of its ordinary
legislative power is a law. Power of the
legislature under Article 368 is comparable to
the creative power of the constituent assembly.
Any enactment under Article 368 cannot be
termed as law as per Article 13(2). So the
Parliament cannot make or amend by a simple
majority. The main inference drawn from the
ruling was that fundamental rights were subject
to the constitutional amendments.
<br>
<br>
However in the Golaknath Vs the State of
Punjab case (1967) the SC overruled its earlier
ruling and held that the Parliament enjoyed only
one type of legislative power i.e. ordinary
legislative power and not the constituent
legislative power because Article 368 was the
procedure to amend the Constitution and does
not confirm the power of the legislature to amend
it. Further the FRs have been given a
transcendental position and therefore no organ
functioning under the Constitution can amend
the FRs and thus FRs were unamendable or
could be amended only by establishing a new
constituent assembly.
<br>
<br>
As a response to this judgment, the
government in 1971 passed the 24th Amendment
Act 1971 and amended Article 13 and
introduced Art 13(4) which states that “Nothing
in Article 13 shall apply to a constitutional
amendment passed under Article 368”. The 24th
amendment act also amended Article 368 of the
Constitution which replaced the word
‘procedure’ with the word ‘power’ i.e. the Act
now reads as “Notwithstanding anything in this
Constitution, Parliament may in exercise of its
constituent power amend by way of addition,
variation or repeal any provision of this
Constitution in accordance with the procedure
laid down in this article”. It also introduced
Article 368 (3) which stated that nothing in
Article 13 shall apply to an amendment made
under this Article.

The excerpts of this judgment were once
again challenged under the Keshvananda
Bharati Vs the State of Kerala (1973) case in
which the SC upheld the constitutional validity
of the 24th Amendment Act i.e. the Parliament
enjoys the powers to amend any part of the
Constitution including the fundamental rights.
However it also stated that the amending
powers of the Parliament are limited to the extent
of not destroying the basic structure of the
Constitution.
The essence of this landmark judgment was
once again challenged by the 42nd Amendment
act which introduced Article 368(4) which stated
that no amendment of this Constitution shall be
called in question in any court of law. Another
Article 368(5) was introduced which stated that
for removal of doubts it is hereby declared that
there shall be no limitation whatsoever to the
constituent power of the Parliament to amend
the Constitution under this Article.
These features introduced by the 42nd
Amendment were once again subjected to
judicial scrutiny in the Minerva Mills Vs UoI case
1980. In this case, SC held that the Clauses 368(4)
and 368(5) were extra-constitutional. Further,
the power of judicial review is a part of the basic
structure of the Constitution, therefore Article
368(5) was void and therefore the power to
amend is subject to not destroying the basic
structure of the Constitution.
<br>
<br>
The verdict in the Minerva Mills case not only
asserted the indestructibility of the basic structure
of the Constitution but also reinstated the
supremacy of the ideas represented by the ‘basic
structure’ over legal and constitutional
entanglements in the form of amendments,
verdicts and legal pronouncements which
ultimately fail to eclipse the spirit of truth and
freedom which is a characterstic of the larger
Indian culture.
