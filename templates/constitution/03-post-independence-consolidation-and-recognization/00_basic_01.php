<h3>Post Independence Consolidation And Recognization</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PARTITION AND PUTTING THE
PIECES TOGETHER</i></strong></div>

India and Pakistan won independence in
August 1947, following a nationalist struggle
lasting nearly three decades. It set a vital
precedent for the negotiated winding up of
European empires elsewhere. Unfortunately, it
was accompanied by the largest mass migration
in human history of some 10 million. As many
as one million civilians died in the accompanying
riots and local-level fighting, particularly in the
western region of Punjab which was cut in two
by the border. One explanation for the chaos in
which the two nations came into being, is
Britain's hurried withdrawal with the realisation
it could ill-afford its over-extended empire.
Pakistan celebrated its independence on 14
August and India on 15 August 1947, the border
between the two new states was not announced
until 17 August. It was drawn up by a British
lawyer, Cyril Radcliffe, who had little knowledge
of Indian conditions and with the use of out-ofdate maps and census materials. Communities,
families and farms were cut in two, but by
delaying the announcement the British managed
to avoid responsibility for the worst fighting and
the mass migration that had followed. The total
population of the undivided Punjab Province
was 33 million. It included territories directly
administered by the British (pop. 28 million) and
several princely states. The Punjab was a Muslim
majority province while Hindus and Sikhs
together made up a very large minority of 44-47
per cent. The principle on which India and the
Punjab were divided was that Muslim-majority
areas were separated from the rest of India and
given to Pakistan. After partition, 90% of the
subcontinent's industry, and taxable income base
remained in India, including the largest cities of
Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta. The economy of
Pakistan was chiefly agricultural, and controlled
by feudal elites. The great advantage enjoyed by
the Indian National Congress was that it had
worked hard for 40 years to reconcile differences
and achieve some cohesion among its leaders.
The heartland of support for the Muslim League,
however, lay in central north India (Uttar
Pradesh) which was not included within
Pakistan.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PARTITION: THE TRAGEDY</i></strong></div>

In a memorable address to the Constituent
Assembly on the night of 14 August, Jawaharlal
Nehru, speaking as the first Prime Minister of a
free India and giving expression to the feelings
of the people, said: "Long years ago we made a
tryst with destiny, and now the time comes
when we shall redeem our pledge..... . At the
stroke of the midnight hour, when the world
sleeps, India will awake to life and freedom. A
moment comes, which comes but rarely in
history, when we step out from the old to the
new, when an age ends, and when the soul of a
nation, long suppressed, finds utterance. It is
fitting that at this solemn moment we take the
pledge of dedication to the service of India and
her people and to the still larger cause of
humanity.... . We end today a period of ill
fortune and India discovers herself again."
But, this tryst with destiny started with an
unforeseen blood shedding on both sides of
border. The Partition of India ranks, beyond
doubt, as one of the 10 greatest tragedies in
human history. For the Punjab alone, the loss of
life is estimated somewhere between 500,000-
800,000 and 10 million people were forced to
flee for their lives. More importantly, after World
War II the first case of ethnic cleansing took place
in the Punjab. Therefore, it bore the brunt of the
partition violence. Thus at the end of 1947 all
traces of a Muslim presence in the Indian East
Punjab were wiped out, except for some Muslims
remaining in the tiny princely state of
Malerkotla. In the Pakistani West Punjab, Hindus
and Sikhs became conspicuous by their absence.
Fear of an uncertain future, lack of
communication between the leaders of the
estranged communities, the waning authority of
the British and the consequent unreliability of
the state institutions and functionaries created
the social and political milieu in which suspicion
and fear proliferated, generating against among
the common people. In such situations reaction
and overreaction led to intended and unintended
consequences which aggravated and finally
resulted in the biggest human tragedy in the
history of the Indian subcontinent. Partition was
more than a geographical mutilation of the subcontinent; it was one of those dehumanising
horror stories that have sustained the 20th
century's narratives on revolutions and
liberation, be it the Fuhrer's Final Solution or the
Pol Pot's ethnic cleansing, Mao's Cultural
Revolution or Stalin's Great Terror. It is a stain
on our freedom, the scar on our memory as a
nation.
<br>
<br>
In January 1948, the Government of India,
following a fast by Gandhiji, paid Pakistan
Rs. 550 million as part of the assets of Partition,
even when it feared that the money might be
used to finance military action in Kashmir. The
governments of the two countries differed on
issues raised by evacuee property, left behind by
those who migrated from the two countries, but
every effort was made to resolve them through
regotiations. On January 30, 1948, Mohandas
Gandhi was assassinated by a young Hindu
radical. Since August of 1947, India and Pakistan
have fought three major wars and one minor
war over territorial disputes. The boundary line
in Jammu and Kashmir is particularly troubled.
The partition of India is a signal event in world
history, not merely in the history of the Indian
subcontinent.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTEGRATION OF PRINCELY STATES</i></strong></div>

With great skill and diplomacy and using
both persuasions and pressure, Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel succeeded in integrating the
hundreds of princely states with the India
Union. Some states have joined the Contituent
Assembly in April 1947. But the majority of
princely states had stayed away and a few, such
as those of Travancore, Bhopal and Hyderabad,
publicly announced their desire to claim an
independent status. On 27, June 1947, Sardar
Patel assumed charge of the newly created States,
Department with V.P. Menon as its Secretary.
Patel’s first step was to appeal to the princess
whose territories fell inside India to accede to
the Indian Union in three subjects: foreign
relation, defense and communications. Fearful
of the rising people’s movements in states, and
of patel’s reputation for firmness all but three of
them – Junagadh, Jammu and Kashmir and
Hyderabad—acceded to India by 15 August,
1947.
<br>
<br>
Junagadh was a small state on the coast of
Saurashtra surrounded by Indian territory and
therefore without any geographical continuity
with Pakistani. Yet, its Nawab announced
accession of his state to Pakistan on 15 August,
1947 even thought the people of the state,
overwhelmingly Hindu, desired to join India.
Pakistan accepted Junagadh’s accession. On the
other hand, the people of the state were against
the ruler’s decision. They organized a popular
movement, forced the Nawab to flee and
established a provisional government. Indian
troops marched into the state. A plebiscite was
held in the state in February 1948 which went
overwhelmingly in favour of joining India.
The state of Kashmir was bordered on both
India and Pakistan. Its ruler Hari Singh was a
Hindu, while nearly 75 per cent of the
population was Muslim. Hari Singh did not
accede either to India or Pakistan. He hoped to
stay out of both and to continue as an
independent ruler. On 22 October, with the onset
of winter, several Pathan tribesman, led
unofficially by Pakistani army officers, invaded
Kashmir and rapidly pushed towards Srinagar,
the capital of Kashmir. In panic, on 24 October,
the Maharaja appealed to India for military
assistance. Within days, acting under pressure,
the Maharaja acceded to India and signed the
instrument of accession with India. After
accession India decided to send troops to
Srinagar. In order to avoid a full-scale war
between India and Pakistan, the Government of
India agreed, on 30 December, 1947, on
Mountbatten’s suggestion, to refer the Kashmir
problem to the United Nations Security Council,
asking for vacation of aggression by Pakistan.
Nehru was to regret this decision later as the
Kashmir issue became a victim of cold war
politics. Security Council, guided by Britain and
the United States, tended to side with Pakistan
instead of declaring Pakistan an aggressor state.
The Nizam of Hyderabad was the third
Indian ruler who did not accede to India before
15 August. Instead, he claimed an independent
status and, encouraged by Pakistan, began to
expand his armed forces. In November 1947, the
Government of India signed a standstill
agreement with the Nizam, hoping that while
the negotiations proceeded, the latter would
introduce representative government in the state.
But the Nizam hoped to prolong negotiations
and in the meanwhile build up his military
strength and force India to accept his
sovereignty. Meanwhile, there was rapid growth
of the militant Muslim communal organization,
Ittlihad ul Muslimin and its paramilitary wing,
the Razakars with active official help by Nizam.
As a result of attacks by the Razakars and
repression by the state authorities, thousands of
people fled the state and took shelter in
temporary camps in Indian territory. The state
Congress-led movement now took to arms. By
then a powerful communist-led peasant struggle
had developed in the Talangana region of the
state from the latter half of 1946. On 13
September 1948, the Indian army moved into
Hyderabad. The Nizam surrendered after three
days and acceded to the Indian Union in
November. The Government of India retained
Nizam as formal ruler of the state or its
Rajpramukh, was given a privy purse, and
permitted to keep most of his wealth.
In return for their surrender of all power and
authority, the rulers of major states were given
privy purses in perpetuity, free of all taxes. The
privy purse amounted to Rs. 4.66 crore in 1949
and were later guaranteed by the constitution.
The ruler were allowed succession to the gaddi
and retained certain privileges such as keeping
their titles, flying their personal flags and gun
salutes on ceremonial occasion. However, later
Indira Gandhi abolished most of the above
mentioned concessions.
<br>
<br>
After waiting patiently for international
opinion to put pressure on Portugal, Nehru
ordered Indian troops to march into Goa on the
night of 17 December, 1961. The GovernorGeneral of Goa immediately surrendered
without a fight and the territorial and political
integration of India was completed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATION-BUILDING IN A CONSTITIUTIONAL WAY</i></strong></div>

India’s independence represented for its
people the start of an epoch that was imbued
with a new vision. In 1947, the country
commenced its long march to overcome the
colonial legacy of economic underdevelopedprevalence of disease and stark social inequality
and injustice. 15 August, 1947 was only the first
stop, the first break-the end of colonial political
control. Centuries of backwardness were now
to be overcome, the promises of the freedom
struggle to be fulfilled, and people’s hope to be
met.
<br>
<br>
The tasks of nation-building were taken up
by the Indian people and their leaders with a
certain elan and determination and with
confidence in their capacity to succeed.
Jawaharlal Nehru’s famous ‘Tryst with Destiny’
speech on the eve of independence reflected this
buoyant mood. India has started off with a broad
social consensus on the basic contours of the
India that was to be built on the values of
nationalism, secularism and democracy. Rapid
economic development and radical social change
were other agreed on goals. These values and
goals, and the road to their achievement, had
been mapped over more than seventy years by
the national movement.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AGREEMENT OVER BASIC GOALS</i></strong></div>

The first and the most important task was to
preserve, consolidate and strengthen India’s
unity, to push toward the process of the making
of the Indian nation, and to build up and protect
the national state as an instrument of
development and social transformation. Indian
unity had to be strengthened by recognizing and
accepting India’s immense regional, linguistic,
ethnic and religious diversity.
<br>
<br>
It was agreed that India's revolution had to
be taken beyond the merely political to include
economic and social transformation. The social
scene also called for rapid transformation.
Despite lower-caste movements in several parts
of the country and Gandhiji’s campaign against
untouchability society was under a severe grip
of socio-economic malaises. Male domination
was still nearly total and women suffered
immense social oppression in the family.
Economic development and a democratic
political order were to be accompanied by rapid
social transformation so that existing gross
economic, caste and gender inequalities were
rapidly eliminated, poverty was removed and
the levels of living raised. The structure of Indian
society was to be rapidly transformed in a
broadly socialist direction.
<br>
<br>
The national movement had aroused
expectations of a rapid rise in personal and
societal prosperity, of social and economic equity
and equality, of the good life. Indira Gandhi’s
slogan of ‘Garibi Hatao’ in 1971 further fuelled
these expectations as did the process of
continuous politicization since 1950. The
constantly rising aspiration and expectations
had to be fulfilled as rapidly as possible and
without letting too wide a gap develop between
expectations and fulfillment. At the same time,
political stability had to be ensured for the
accomplishment of all the tasks. The political
system had to combine stability with growth,
social transformation and deepening of the
political process. The Indian revolution had to
be gradual, non-violent and based on political
stability, but it had to be a revolution all the same.
First act of this revolution was to be the evolution
of a constitution as per India needs. Story of
same is given below.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EVOLUTION OF THE CONSTITUTION</i></strong></div>

The Constitution of India came into force on
January 26, 1950. Since then the day is celebrated
as Republic Day. The process of the evolution of
the constitution began many decades before
January 26, 1950 and has continued unabated
since. Its origin lie deeply embedded in the
struggle for independence from Britain and in
the movement for responsible and constitutional
government in the princely states. National
movement has popularized among the people
the notions of parliamentary democracy,
republicanism, civil liberties, social and economic
justice, which became among the essential
principles of constitution.
<br>
<br>
The actual functioning of the Congress
organization, especially from 1920 onwards,
after Gandhiji modified the Congress
constitution, was based on the elective principle.
All office-bearers were chosen through election.
Even more than the form, it was the spirit of
democracy, on which in the last and first resort
the foundations of the constitution rest, which
was inculcated among the people by the national
movement. This found expression in widespread
mass participation. It ensured a place for adult
franchise after independence. Age for the same
was reduced from 21 years to 18 years during
time of Rajiv Gandhi.
<br>
<br>
Elective principle was first introduced by the
British in the Indian Councils Act of 1892. The
Congress and its nationalist precursors and the
Indian Press, had been demanding elections to
the councils, elected majorities in them and
greater powers to the non-official members of
councils for many years before that. Nationalist
demands had already far exceeded what was
granted in 1892. National movement, by the end
of the second decade of the twentieth century
had begun to espouse the doctrine of selfdetermination or the right of Indians to frame
their own constitution.
<br>
<br>
Tilak and Annie Besant had launched a
'Home Rule' agitation. The Congress-Muslim
League scheme for constitutional reforms
emerged out of the Congress League Pact of
1916. A very prominent role was played by
Motilal Nehru, who introduced resolution on
February 8, 1924 in the Central Legislative
Assembly which asked the government to
summon, at an early date, a representative
Round Table Conference to recommend with
due regard to the protection of the rights and
interests of important minorities and the scheme
of a constitution for India. This was the first
time that the demand for a constitution and the
procedure for its adoption were spelt out in clear
terms.
<br>
<br>
This resolution, which came to be known as
the ‘National Demand’, was passed by a large
majority in the Central Legislative Assembly- 76
for and 48 against. In May 1928, Congress
appointed a committee chaired by Motilal Nehru
to determine the principles of the constitution
for India. The Nehru Report, submitted on
August 10, 1928 was in effect an outline of a
draft constitution for India. Most of its features
were later included in the Constitution of India.
The demand for a Constituent Assembly was
repeated frequently after 1934 and included in
the Congress manifesto for the 1936-37. In 1937,
a resolution recommending replacement of the
Government of India Act, 1935 by a constitution
framed by a Constituent Assembly was
introduced in the Central Legislative Assembly.
The ‘August Offer’ made by Viceroy
Linlithgow in 1940 in an attempt to secure
Indian cooperation in the war effort for the first
time conceded that the framing of new
constitution should be primarily the
responsibility of Indian themselves. The Cripps
proposals were a major advance in the position
of the British government. For the first time, it
was clearly accepted that the constitution would
be the sole responsibility of Indians alone. On
February 19, 1946, the British Government
declared that they were sending a Cabinet
Mission to India to resolve the whole issue of
freedom and constitution making. The Congress
responded to the Cabinet Mission Scheme by
pointing out that in its view the constituent
Assembly, once it came into being, would be
sovereign. It would have the right to accept or
reject the Cabinet Mission’s proposal on specifics.
Though an assurance on those lines was not
forthcoming from the British, the Congress
nevertheless decided after a great deal of debate
to accept the scheme and try to work it, as there
was a feeling that outright rejection would again
delay the process of transfer of power. The
Muslim League continued to oppose the
Constituent Assembly at every stage, before as
well as after it was constituted.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY</i></strong></div>

The Constituent Assembly was to have 389
members. Of these, 296 were to be from British
India and 93 from the princely Indian states.
Initially, however, the Constituent Assembly
comprised only members from British India.
Elections of these were held in July-August 1946.
Of the 210 seats in the general category, congress
won 199. It also won 3 out of 4 Sikh seats from
Punjab. The total Congress tally was 208. The
Muslim League won 73 out of the 78 Muslim
seats. Especially since the Constituent Assembly
was not elected on the basis of universal adult
franchise and was thus not as truly
representative in character as the Congress had
wished and demanded and also because only
Muslims and Sikhs were recognized as
minorities deserving special representation,
special effort was made to see that the Assembly
did indeed reflect the diversity of perspectives
present in the country.
<br>
<br>
The Congress Working Committee in early
July 1946 specifically instructed the Provincial
Congress Committees to include representatives
of Scheduled Castes, Parsis, Indian Christians,
Anglo-Indians, tribals and women in the
Congress list for the general category. The other
important consideration in choosing names for
election to the Assembly was that the very best
talent available in the country must be involved
in the task of the making of the constitution. The
lead was given by Gandhiji himself who
suggested the names of sixteen eminent persons
for inclusion in the Congress list. Altogether thirty
people who were not members of the Congress
were thus elected on the Congress ticket. Having
failed to prevent the election of the Constituent
Assembly, the Muslim League now concentrated
its energies on refusing to join its deliberations.
The Congress and Jawaharlal Nehru as
president of the interim government continued
to make conciliatory gestures to Muslim League,
but to no avail. Accordingly, on November 20,
1946, the decision to convene the first session of
the Constituent Assembly on December 9, 1946
was announced. At Nehru’s insistence, the oldest
member of the Assembly, Dr. Sachchidanand
Sinha, became the provisional President and
invitations were issued in the name of the
secretary of the Constituent Assembly. In doing
this Nehru was establishing, for all to see, the
independence of the Assembly from British
control. On December 9, 1946, the Constituent
Assembly of India began its first session. For all
practical purposes, the chronicle of Independent
India began on that historic day.
<br>
<br>
The real responsibility of deciding the
constitutional framework within which the
government and people of India were to function
had been transferred and assumed by the Indian
people with the convening of the Constituent
Assembly. The first session was attended by 207
members. The Muslim League, having failed to
prevent the convening of the Assembly, now
refused to join its deliberations. Consequently,
the Seventy Six Muslim members of the League
stayed away and the four Congress Muslim
members attended this session. On December 11,
1946, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected the
permanent Chairman, an office later designated
as President of the Assembly On December 13,
1946, Jawaharlal Nehru moved the famous
Objectives Resolution, which was debated till
December 19 but its adoption was postponed to
enable the representatives of the Muslim League
and the princely states to join.
<br>
<br>
At the next session, which took place from
January 20-22, 1947, it was decided to not wait
any longer for the League, and the Objectives
Resolution was passed. The third session was
held from April 18 to May 2, 1947 and the League
still did not join. On June 3, 1947, the
Mountbatten Plan was announced which made
it clear that India was to be partitioned. The
completely altered the perspective of the
Constituent Assembly, as the Cabinet Mission
Plan, the essence of which was Compromise
with the league, was no larger relevant. With
India becoming independent on August 15, 1947
the Constituent Assembly became a sovereign
body, and also doubled as the legislature for the
new state. It was responsible for framing the
constitution as well as making ordinary laws.
That its function as a legislature as well as its
large size did not come in the way of its effectively
performing its duties as a constitution making
body is due to the enormous preparatory work
as well as organizational skills and hardwork of
its leading members.
<br>
<br>
The work was organized into five stages:
Committees were asked to present reports on
basic issues; B.N. Rau, the constitutional advisor,
prepared an initial draft on the basis of the
reports of these committees and his own research
into the constitutions of other countries; The
drafting committee, chaired by Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar, presented a detailed draft
Constitution which was published for public
discussion and comments; The draft Constitution
was discussed and amendments proposal; and
the constitution was adopted.
In addition, a critical role was played by
Congress party. It had asked a committee of
experts to prepare material and proposals for the
constitution as early as July 4, 1946. The
committee was chaired by Nehru and had Asaf
Ali, K.T. Shah, D.R. Gadgil, K.M. Munshi,
Humayun Kabir, R. Shanthanam and N.
Gopalaswamy Ayyangar as members. Nehru
drafted the Objectives Resolution and the CWC
and AICC ratified it on 20 and 21 November
1946 well in time for its introduction in the first
session of the Assembly. This practice continued
till the constitution was adopted with the
Congressmen thoroughly discussing and
examining each provision in their party forums,
in addition to participating fully in the debates
in the Assembly. Jawaharlal Nehru, who drafted
the Objective Resolution, which spelt out the
philosophy and basic features of the constitution,
set a formidable example by his keen involvement
in every aspect of the process. Sardar Patel’s
interest was second, if at all, only to Nehru’s. He
played the decisive part in bringing in the
representatives of the erstwhile princely states
into the Constituent Assembly, in seeing to it that
separate electorates were eliminated and in
scotching any move for reservation of seats for
religions minorities. Rajendra Prasad won
acclaim for his impartiality and dignity as
President of the Assembly. Maulana Azad
brought his formidable scholarship and
philosophical mind to bear on many issues of
grave importance. Informed by a strong sense
of its historic role in laying the foundations of
independent India, the Congress party tried hard
to do its best by the people it had led to freedom.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE INDIAN
CONSTITUTION</i></strong></div>

The constitution of India lays down a set of
rules to which the ordinary laws of the country
must conform. It provides a framework for a
democratic and parliamentary form of
government. The constitution also includes- List
of Fundamental Rights and Directive Principlesthe first, a guarantee against encroachments by
the state and the second a set of directives to the
state to introduce reforms to make those rights
effective.
<br>
<br>
The basic philosophy of the constitution, its
moving spirit, is to be found in the Preamble.
The Preamble itself was based on the Objectives
Resolution drafted by Nehru and introduced in
the Assembly in its first session on December 13,
1946 and adopted on January 22, 1947. The
preamble states that the people of India in the
Constituent Assembly made a solemn resolve to
secure liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith
and worship, Equality of status and of
opportunity; and to promote among them all,
Fraternity assuring the dignity of the individual
and the unity of the nation. It has been pointed
out that the priority given to the concept of
justice as compared to liberty, equality,
fraternity, and to social and economic as
compared to political justice, was deliberate. The
order of the words indicated that the concept of
social and economic justice was perhaps
considered the most fundamental norm of the
Constitution of India.
<br>
<br>
The constitution declares India to be a
sovereign, socialist, secular and democratic
republic. Even though the terms secular and
socialist were added to the constitution only by
the 42nd Amendment in 1976, the spirit
embodying the constitution was secular. In 1973
the Supreme Court held the secular character of
the constitution to be one of the basic features of
the constitution. While Fundamental Rights are
justiciable and Directive Principles are not, the
latter are no less important for that reason. The
Universal Declaration of Human Rights also
contains two sets of rights and the new economic
and social rights. In the Indian constitution, the
first kind is included under Fundamental Rights
and the second under Directive Principles. The
reason for the distinction between the two is very
simply that while the state could straight-away
guarantee political and civil liberties contained
under ‘Fundamental Right’, it could only secure
economic and social justice over a period of time
as the economy developed and social change
took place. The latter set of rights could not go
to a court of law in case of denial.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>REORGANISATION OF STATES</i></strong></div>

After independence, the demand for the
reorganisation of states on linguistic basis was
raised from different regions. The Constitution
Assembly appointed S.K. Dhar Commission in
Nov. 1947 to study the issue of reorganisation of
States on linguistic basis. The commission in its
report, submitted in 1948, recommended against
the organisation of states purely on linguistic
basis. Instead, the commission suggested the
following criteria alongwith languageGeographical contiguity, Financial self-reliance,
Administrative viability and Potential for
development.
<br>
<br>
The Congress, in its Jaipur session in 1948,
appointed a three member committee to consider
the recommendations of Dhar Commission. The
Committee is popularly known as JVP
Committee after the name of its three members
– Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabh Bhai Patel, and
Pattabhi Sitarammaiah. The committee rejected
language as the basis of reorganisation of states.
It suggested that the security, unity and
economic prosperity of the nation as the criteria
of reorganisation. The Congress Working
Committee accepted its recommendation in
1949, but the demand for linguistic
reorganisation of States persisted in southern
states particularly in Telungu speaking areas. On
19 October, 1952, a popular freedom fighter,
Patti Sriramalu, undertook a fast unto death over
the demand for a separate Andhra and expired
after fifty eight days. His death was follwoed by
three days of violence all over Andhra. The
government immediately gave in and conceded
the demand for a separate State of Andhra,
which finally came into existence in October
1953. Simultaneously, Tamil Nadu was created
as a Tamil-speaking state. This incident led to
appointment of the States Reorganisation
Commission.
<br>
<br>
To make an exhaustive study, the
Government of India setup States Reorganisation
Commission in 1953 which was headed by Fazal
Ali. The other members of the commission were
Hriday Nath Kunzru and K.M. Panikkar.
The reorganization of the states based on
language, a major aspect of national consolidation and integration, came to the fore almost
immediately after independence. The boundaries
of provinces in pre-1947 India had been drawn
in a haphazard manner as the British conquest
of India had proceeded for nearly a hundred
years. No heed was paid to linguistic or cultural
cohesion so that most of the provinces were multilingual and multi-cultural. The interspersed
princely states had added a further element of
heterogeneity.
<br>
<br>
The case for linguistic states as administrative
units was very strong. Language is closely
related to culture and therefore to the customs
of people. Besides, the massive spread of
education and growth of mass literacy can only
occur through the medium of the mother tongue.
SRC was to examine ‘objectively and
dispassionately’ the entire question of the
reorganization of the states of the union.
Throughout the two years of its work, the
Commission was faced with meetings,
demonstrations, agitations, and hunger strikes.
The SRC submitted its report in October 1955.
While laying down that due consideration
should be given to administrative and economic
factors, it recognized for the most part the
linguistic principle and recommended redrawing
of state boundaries on that basis. The
Commission, however, opposed the splitting of
Bombay and Punjab. Despite strong reaction to
the report in many parts of the country, the SRC's
recommendations were accepted, though with
certain modifications, and were quickly
implemented.
<br>
<br>
The Commission submitted its report to the
government of India on September 30, 1955.
Some of the important recommendations of the
Commission were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Indian Union was to consist of 16 States
as against the existing 27 and three centrally
administered territories.</li>
        <li>Special safeguards were recommended for
linguistic minorities.</li>
        <li>In the interests of national unity and good
administration, the Commission recommended the reconstitution of certain All
India Services. It further recommended that
atleast 50 per cent of the new entrants to

time to come, English continue to occupy
an important place in the universities and
institutions of higher learning.</li>
        <li>The Commission rejected the demand for

such a state will solve neither the language

The States Reorganization Act was passed
by parliament in November, 1956. It provided
for fourteen states and six centrally administered
territories. The Telengana area of Hyderabad
state was transferred to Andhra; merging the
Malabar district of the old Madras Presidency
with Travancore-Cochin created Kerala. Certain
Kannada-speaking areas of the states of Bombay,
Madras, Hyderabad and Coorg were added to
the Mysore state. Merging the states of Kutch
and Saurashtra and the Marathi-speaking areas
of Hyderabad with it enlarged Bombay state.
The State Reorganisation Act was passed by
Parliament in 1956 to give, effect to these
recommendations. It provided for fourteen States
and six Union Territory. But two of the most
sensitive area, Bombay and Punjab, were not
reorganised on linguistic basis. The demands for
separate tribal states, including Jharkhand and
Nagaland, were also bypassed.
<br>
<br>
Soon, Gujarat and Nagaland were created
as separate states. In 1966, Punjab was divided
into two parts, Punjab and Haryana. The hilly
areas of Punjab were added to Himachal
Pradesh, which itself was constituted as an
independent state on January 25, 1971. The map
of India has undergone further changes since
1966. In 1975, there was an addition to the
territorial boundaries of India in the form of the
State of Sikkim, which was till then a protectorate
of India. Radical changes have been made in the
map of North-Eastern region of India which now
has 7 States. Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and
Goa, Daman & Diu have been elevated to
statehood and Chattisgarh, Uttranchal and
Jharkhand are the 3 youngest states. At present
the Union of India consists of 28 States and 7
Union Territories.
<br>
<br>
From now onward we would present the
process of political consolidation and maturity
that unfolded in many states. First, states’
political landscape will be discussed and then
a brief account of national level politics will
be presented.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAHARASHTRA- issues</i></strong></div>

The strongest reaction against the SRC's
report and the States Reorganization Act came
from Maharashtra where widespread rioting
broke out and many people were killed in
Bombay city in police firings in January 1956.
The opposition parties supported by a wide
spectrum of public opinion organized a powerful
protest movement. Under pressure, the
government decided in June 1956 to divide the
Bombay state into two linguistic states of
Maharashtra and Gujarat with Bombay city
forming a separate, centrally administered state.
This move too was strongly opposed by the
Maharashtrians.
<br>
<br>
Nehru reverted to the formation of bilingual,
greater Bombay. This move was, however,
opposed by the people both of Maharashtra and
Gujarat. The broad-based Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti and Maha Gujarat Janata
Parishad led the movements in the two parts of
the state. In Maharashtra, even a large section
of Congressmen joined the demand for a
unilingual Maharashtra with Bombay as its
capital; and C.D. Deshmukh, the Finance
Minister in the Central Cabinet, resigned from
his office on this question. The Gujaratis felt that
they would be a minority in the new state. They
too would not agree to give up Bombay city to
Maharashtra. Violence and arson now spread
to Ahmedabad and other parts of Gujarat.
To express resentment against the
Commission’s report with regard to
Maharashtra there was fierce rioting and
violence under the auspices of these two
linguistically based organisations, namely, the
Samyukta Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti and the
Maha Gujarat Parishad. After three years of
trouble, ultimately in 1960, the demands for
reorganisation were accepted and Maharashtra
and Gujarat were constituted as separate
linguistic states with Bombay as part of
Maharashtra.
<br>
<br>
The demand to transfer the Marathidominated area of Belgaum to Maharashtra from
Karnataka has been a serious political issue
between two states. During United Maharashtra
Movement, 11 persons were killed in police firing
in Belgaum. The border dispute case is pending
in the Supreme Court. Belgaum bordering
Maharashtra has a sizeable Marathi-speaking
population, and had for decades been a bone of
contention between the two States. Earlier
constituted, Mahajan Commission’s recommendations have been challenged in court at
present.
<br>
<br>
GOA: When India became a Republic, on
26th January, 1950, Goa was still a Portuguese
colony. Twelve years later, the Indian army
walked into the territory and, after the garrison
there surrendered, announced that it had been
reunited with the motherland. Shortly
afterwards the Goans were allowed to vote for
the first time in their very long history.
There is a distinction between ‘integration’
and ‘assimilation’. The Goans are comfortable
with the former. In the first decade after
Liberation, the most serious threat to Goan
identity came from the neighbouring state of
Maharashtra. Maharashtrawadi Gomantak
Party, vigorously campaigned for Goa to be
merged into that state. In a referendum held in
the late 1960s, the Goans chose not to join
Maharashtra. In subsequent decades, there was
a vigorous revival of a Konkani identity. After
Goa was elevated from Union Territory status
to full statehood in 1987, Konkani was bestowed
with the title of ‘official’ language.
<br>
<br>
J & K: issues
Immediately after Kashmir's accession in
October 1947, India had offered a plebiscite
under international auspices for the people of
Kashmir to take a final decision on it. But there
was a condition that Pakistan's troops must
vacate Kashmir before a plebiscite could be held.
Till the end of 1953, the Government of India
was willing to abide by the results of a plebiscite
if proper conditions were created for it. But a
plebiscite could not be held, mainly because
Pakistan did not withdraw its forces from
Pakistan-held Kashmir. Pakistan continued to
take a non-conciliatory and aggressive approach.
By the end of 1956, the Indian government made
it clear to Pakistan and the international
community that the situation in Kashmir and
Indo-Pak relations had changed so completely
that its earlier offer had become absolute and
Kashmir's accession to India had become a
settled fact.
<br>
<br>
Under the Instrument of Accession signed
in October 1947, the state of Jammu and
Kashmir was granted a temporary special status
in the Indian Union under Article 370 of the
Indian constitution. The state ceded to the Indian
Union only in defence, foreign affairs and
communication, retaining autonomy in all other
matters. In 1956, the Constituent Assembly of
Jammu and Kashmir ratified the accession of the
state to India. Over the years, the state's special
status has been considerably modified and the
state is almost on similar footing with other states
except the clauses mentioned under Article 370.
Sheikh Abdullah: As Sher-e-Kashmir,
Sheikh Abdullah brought Kashmir into India but
spent his whole life negotiating the terms of that
accession. He spent many years in jails on
charges of separatism, but had an utter lack of
bitterness towards Nehru-Indira. He died as the
CM of the land he had fought so hard for.
Pressed by communal elements in the Kashmir
Valley demanding merger with Pakistan and
harassed by communalists in Jammu demanding
full integration with India, Abdullah began to
demand separation. By the middle of July 1953,
Abdullah publicly demanded that Kashmir
should become independent. Abdullah was
consequently dismissed and Bakshi Ghulam
Mohammed was installed as Prime Minister.
Under Nehru's pressure, he was released on 8,
January 1958 but was rearrested three months
later as he continued with his separatist
campaign and appeals to communal sentiments.
Nehru got Abdullah released again in April 1964.
Abdullah, however, continued to claim that
Kashmir's accession to India was not final and
that he would fight to secure for the state the
right of self-determination. But at the same time,
he was also against the state's merger with
Pakistan. He was opposed by pro-Pakistani
political groups for his independent stand.
<br>
<br>
In 1975 Abdullah again became Chief
Minister and the leader of the National
Conference after agreeing that he will not
demand separation. In the July 1977 mid-term
poll in the state he won comfortably. His son,
Farooq Abdullah, succeeded him as Chief
Minister, on his death in 1982. Farooq won a
comfortable majority in the mid-term elections
in July 1984. In a political coup against Farooq,
his brother-in-law, G.M. Shah, split the national
Conference. Later, the Governor, Jagmohan,
dismissed Farooq as Chief Minister and installed
G.M. Shah in his place. It was alleged that he
was acting at the behest of the central
Government. On 2 July, 1984, Farooq Abdullah,
the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, asked
the governor, Jagmohan, to immediately call a
session of the legislative assembly. He wanted to
test his majority on the floor of the house as
twelve members had deserted his party. The
Governor, however, dismissed his ministry from
office and installed a new man, G.M. Shah, as
Chief Minister. Abdullah campaigned against his
dismissal all over the country.
<br>
<br>
The incident was also cited as proof of the
union government's infringement of the
autonomy of the state and was thus a handy
tool for stocking sucessionist fires. Rajiv Gandhi
entered into an alliance with Farooq Abdullah
for the assembly elections in early 1987. But
Farooq, though won the election, found that he
was not able to manage the state. Both Hizbul
Mujahideen and other fundamentalist, proPakistan groups and those for independence led
by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front
(JKLE) took to violent agitations and armed
insurgency. All these groups were actively
financed, trained and armed by Pakistan.
V.P. Singh at the Center dismissed Farooq
Abdullh's government, which had lost control
over the Valley to the terrorist groups, and
imposed President's Rule in the state. Farooq,
however, made another political comeback by
winning the long-delayed elections in 1996. In
the 2002 state elections, he lost power and the
state came to be ruled by an alliance of the
People's Democratic Party, headed by Mufti
Muhammed Sayeed, and the Congress party. At
present, Omar Abdullah, son of Farooq, is Chief
Minister of state.
<br>
<br>
Pakistan’s Role: J & K was always the root
of 3 open wars Pakistan fought with India 1948,
1965 & 1971, though to a lesser extent in case of
1971 war. In 1974 the Kashmir State
Government reached an accord with the Indian
Government, which affirmed its status as "a
constituent unit of the union of India". Pakistan
rejected this accord. The 1980s had seen some
diplomatic discussions aimed at resolving
outstanding differences, between India and
Pakistan. In 1982, the two rivals began
unsuccessful talks on a non-aggression treaty.
However, in 1984 Indian troops were airlifted
to the Siachen glacier in northern Kashmir
(Operation Meghdoot) which increased tension
in the area. Pakistan retaliated by fortifying the
glacier from its side of what has become known
as the world's highest war zone.
In 1988, India and Pakistan had signed an
agreement not to attack each other's nuclear
facilities. But in 1989 armed insurgency against
India began in the Kashmir valley. Muslim
political parties complained that the 1987
elections to the state's legislative assembly were
rigged against them, and they formed militant
wings. Some groups demanded independence
for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and others
union with Pakistan. Pakistan gave its "moral
and diplomatic" support to the movement, calling
for the issue to be resolved via a UN-sponsored
referendum. Whereas, India maintains that
Pakistan's support of the insurgency consisted
of training and supplying weapons to militant.
During the 1990s, several new militant
groups emerged, most of which held radical
Islamic views. The ideological emphasis of the
movement shifted from a nationalistic and
secularist one to an Islamic one. This was in part
driven by the arrival in the valley of Kashmir of
large numbers of Islamic "Jihadi" fighters who
had fought in Afghanistan against the Soviet
Union in the 1980s. India and Pakistan set up
meetings to defuse tension over Jammu and
Kashmir. The diplomatic push became more
concerted a year later and an agenda for peace
talks was agreed on. In 1997, itself, Pakistan also
suggested that the two sides meet to discuss
restraining nuclear and missile capabilities. In
1996, Pakistani and Indian military officers met
on the Line of Control to ease tension. The
celebrations of 50 years of independence in 1997
in both countries coincided with a surge in
diplomatic activity. During 1997, Indian and
Pakistani foreign ministers met in Delhi. After
rounds of talks in Islamabad, they announced
an eight-point agenda for peace talks, including
discussion of the Kashmir issue. Though, talks
ended in a stalemate. Lahore bus service, kargil
incursion, Agra Summit, attack on Parliament
and Mumbai have been the latest flash points
between the two nations.
<br>
<br>
The fact that the majority of Kashmiris are
Muslims has nothing to do with the country
which Kashmir joins. The ruler of Kashmir
acceded to India and the real leaders of the
people of Kashmir, Muslims themselves, have
clearly stated their desire to remain with India.
Kashmir is, in fact, a part of India. The part held
by Pakistan is wrongly seized by aggression and
must be vacated in favour of the real
government.
<br>
<br>
Despite many rounds of talks between India
and Pakistan, a long term solution to problems
in valley and other areas of J & K still eludes the
nation. A large role for the army in Kashmir has
been a necessity in view of Pakistani military
threat and subversion; but this has also meant a
high cost in terms of the functioning of a Civil
Polity and Human Rights. Kashmir has also
suffered from near-perpetual political instability.
How the story unfolds in the J & K is to be seen.
A new strategy of engagement with Islamabad
needs to abandon the myth that nothing was
achieved during the earlier peace process. Even
a cursory look at the host of significant
Confidence Building Measures — ranging from
the Agreement on Advance Notification of
Ballistic Missile Tests (signed in 2005) to the
establishment of a communication link between
Pakistan's Maritime Security Agency and the
Indian Coast Guard, to legalising the screening
of Indian films in Pakistan in 2008 — shows that
tangible, positive progress was made and further
progress is not impossible. The very fact that the
two governments, albeit through the backchannel, had closely and seriously examined
potential solutions to Kashmir demonstrates that
there are enough no. of peace supporters within
the two establishments who can think outside
the box.
<br>
<br>
Differences are fundamental and intentions
are hostile between two nations. Despite this fact
there are compelling reasons why India should
proactively engage with Pakistan. First, for the
domestic reason that a tension-free relationship
with Pakistan would help us consolidate our
nationhood. Second, for the regional reason that
regional terrorism can be effectively tackled only
in cooperation with Pakistan and not in
confrontation with it. Third, for the international
reason that India will not be able to play its due
role in international affairs so long as it is
dragged down by its quarrels with Pakistan. As
for just turning our backs on each other, Siamese
twins have no option but to move together even
when they are attempting to pull away from
each other.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PUNJAB- issues</i></strong></div>

Punjab story starts with Patiala Muzara
Movement. The 'muzara of tenants movement'
that was going on the Patiala at inde-pendence
had its origins in the late nineteenth century.
Biswedars (the local term for landlords), who
earlier had only some mafi claims or revenuecollecting rights, due to their growing influence
in the administration, succeeded in claiming
proprietary status and relegated the entire body
of cultivating proprietors of roughly 800 villages,
comprising one-sixth the area of the state, to the
position of occupancy tenants and tenants at will.
The new tenants regarded the new landlords as
parvenus, who had no legitimate right to the
land which had belonged to the tenants for
generations and not in the manner in which a
traditional tenantry might regard their old,
established, feudal landowners, whose right to
the land had acquired a certain social legitimacy
by virtue of its very antiquity.
The grievance festered, but the opportunity
for expression came only with the new wave of
political awareness brought by the national
movement and its associated movements such
as the Akali and the Praja Mandal movements
in the 1920s. But the repressive atmosphere in
Patiala made any political activity extremely
difficult, and it was only in the late 1930s with
the change in the political atmosphere brought
about by the formation of Congress ministries in
many provinces that it became possible for a
movement to emerge. From 1939, a powerful
movement emerged and from 1945, in escalated
into an open confrontation between muzaras
and biswedars, with the state intervening mainly
to institute cases of non-payment of batai (rent
in kind) and criminal assault. Numerous armed
crashes took place at different places, some over
forcible possession of land, other over forcible
realization of batai.
<br>
<br>
The Praja Mandal, which spearheaded the
anti-Maharaja democratic movement, under the
influence of Brish Bhan, who was sympathetic
to the Communists and the tenants’ cause,
extended support. This gave strength to the
tenants as the Praja Mandal had the weight of
the Congress behind it. With the coming of
independence, Punjab joined the Indian Union.
The repression decreased after the formation of
the PEPSU in July 1948, a new province
comprising the erstwhile princely states of
Punjab. An Agrarian Reforms Enquiry
Committee was set up to make recommendations
and till such time as the legislation could be
enacted, the PEPSU Tenancy (Temporary
Provision) Act was promulgated in January 1952
which protected tenants against eviction. In
1953, the President of India issued the PEPSU
Occupancy Tenants (Vesting of Proprietary
Rights) Act. This legislation, though it did not
meet fully the Communists’ demand of transfer
of proprietary rights without compensation, was
obviously found acceptable by the tenants, and
no further resistance was reported. The
Communist continued, however, to condemn
the new agrarian legislation as inadequate
because the biswedars’ lands were not being
confiscated without compensation. This resulted
in their growing isolation from the peasants, a
process that was also furthered by their desertion
of their erstwhile comrades-in-arms in the
Muzara Movement and the Praja Mandal, the
left wing Congress group led by Brish Bhan. In
the long run, the Communists were also the losers
in this game, because they were too weak to
struggle effectively on their own against the
gradual ascendancy of the Akalis and other
communal and semi-communal and right-wing
groups.
<br>
<br>
After August 1947, Hindu and Sikh
communalists were pitted against each other.
The Congress and the 'Hindu' Nehru, 'who ruled
from Delhi', were made special targets of Akali
anger for representing the Hindu and
Brahminical conspiracy against Sikhs. Here also
major issue was of state language. The Hindu
communalists wanted this status for Hindi and
the Sikh communalists for Punjabi in the
Gurmukhi script. Demand for Creation of
Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Hindi-speaking
Haryana was not accepted. The SRC rejected the
demand on the grounds that there was not much
difference between Hindi and Punjabi and that
the minimum measure of agreement necessary
for making a change did not exist among the
people of Punjab. After a great deal of haggling,
an agreement was arrived at in 1956 between
the Akali Dal and the Government of India
leading to the merger of Punjab and Patiala and
East Punjab Union (PEPSU).
<br>
<br>
Akali Dal under the leadership of Master
Tara Singh soon organized a powerful agitation
around the demand for the formation of a
Punjabi Suba. The Jan Sangh and the other
Hindu organizations and individuals strenuously
opposed this demand on the ground that it
represented an effort to impose Sikh domination
and Sikh theocracy on Punjab. The Harijan Sikhs,
known as Mazhabi Sikhs, who were mostly
landless agricultural labourers, also opposed the
demand for a Punjabi Suba because they were
afraid that the new state would be dominated
by the rich peasants, who as Jat Sikhs were the
main supporters of the Akali Dal. Nehru refused
to concede the demand for a Punjabi Suba
mainly because of its communal underpinnings.
Sant Fateh Singh, who ousted Master Tara
Singh from the leadership of the SGPC and the
Akali Dal, declared that the demand for a
Punjabi Suba was entirely language based. At
the same time, a major political and social
organizations in Haryana demanded a separate
Hindi-speaking state and those in Kangra asked
for its merger with Himachal Pradesh.
In order to widen their support base among
Sikhs, the Akalis began to intensify the
communal content of their politics and to
continuously escalate their demands, the so called 
moderate leaders keeping in step with the
extremists. In 1981, the main Akali Dal, headed
by Sant Longowal, submitted to the Prime
Minister a memorandum of forty-five religious,
political, economic and social demands and
grievances, including the issue of the sharing of
Punjab's river waters between Punjab, Haryana
and Rajasthan and the question of the transfer
of Chandigarh to Punjab, and launched a
virulent campaign around them. Very soon,
implemented of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution
(ASR), adopted in 1973, became the most
prominent demand.
<br>
<br>
The initiator of terrorism was Sant Jarnail
Singh Bhindranwale, who emerged in the late
1970s as a strong campaigner of Sikh orthodoxy.
In this campaign he received the tacit support
of the Punjab Congress led by Giani Zail Singh,
who hoped to use him to undercut the Akalis.
He was, however, to soon become a Frankenstein
and turn against his erstwhile patrons. The
terrorist campaign by Bhindranwale and the All
India Sikh Students Federation, headed by Amrik
Singh, began on 24 April, 1980 with the
assassination of the head of the Nirankari sect.
Till September 1983, terrorist killings were
confined to Nirankaris, petty government
officials and Sikhs who disagreed with
Bhindranwale. In April 1983, A.S. Atwal, a Sikh
deputy inspector-general of police, was killed
just as he was coming out of the Golden Temple.
<br>
<br>
In December 1983, Bhindranwale moved
into Akal Takht within the Golden Temple
fearing arrest. He made it his headquarters,
armoury and a sanctuary for other terrorists. The
attitude of the Akali leadership towards the
terrorists was ambivalent. They neither joined
nor opposed them. Instead of boldly confronting
the communal and separatist challenge to the
Indian polity, Indira Gandhi waited and tried
other ways for three years. Finally the
Government of India undertook military action,
code-named 'Operation Blue Star'.
On 3 June, the army surrounded the Golden
Temple and entered the temple on 5 June. There
it found that the terrorists were far greater in
number and also far better armed than assumed.
The military operation turned into a full-scale
battle. The army had to deploy even tanks in the
end. Over a thousand devotees and temple staff
were trapped inside the temple and many of
them died in the crossfire. The buildings in the
temple complex including Akal Takht were
severely demaged. Harmandir Sahib, the most
hallowed of the Sikh shrines, was riddled with
bullet marks. Among the dead were Bhindranwale and his followers also.
'Operation Blue Star' produced a deep sense
of anger and outrage among Sikhs. It was seen
by most of them as a sacrilege and an affront to
the community. The terrorists vowed vengeance
against Indira Gandhi for having desecrated the
Golden Temple. On the morning of 31 October,
1984, Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two
Sikh members of her security guard. Earlier she
had rejected her security chief's suggestion that
all Sikhs be removed from her security staff. The
assassination of the popular Prime Minister led
to a wave of horror, fear, anger and communal
outrage among people all over the country,
especially among the poor. This anger took an
ugly and communal form in Delhi and some
other parts of North India, where anti-Sikh riots
broke out as soon as the news of the
assassination spread. For three days from the
evening of 31 October, mobs took over the streets
of Delhi and made Sikhs targets of violence.
There was complete failure of the law and order
machinery in giving protection to Sikhs and their
property. The three-day violence in Delhi
resulted in the death of more than 2,500 Sikhs.
The slums and resettlement colonies of Delhi were
the main scenes of carnage.
<br>
<br>
Finally, in August 1985, Rajiv Gandhi and
Longowal signed the Punjab Accord. The
government conceded the major Akali demands.
It was agreed that Chandigarh would be
transferred to Punjab and a commission would
determine which Hindi-speaking terrorists
would be transferred from Punjab to Haryana.
The river water dispute was to be adjudicated
by an independent tribunal. On 20 August,
Longowal announced that the Akalis would
participate in the elections. He was assassinated
by the terrorists on same day. The Akalis secured
an absolute majority in the state assembly for
the first time in their history.
There was a resurgence in terrorists activities.
The militant groups regrouped taking advantage
of policies of the Barnala government where the
state government was riven with factionalism
and thus was unable to contain them. Soon, the
central government dismissed the Barnala
ministry and imposed President's Rule in Punjab
in May, 1987. Despite this, terrorism in Punjab
went on growing.
<br>
<br>
After 1985, terrorism begun to be openly
funded and supported by Pakistan.
A hard policy towards terrorism was
followed from mid-1991 onwards by the
Narasimha Rao government. In February, 1992
elections, congress came into power led by Beant
Singh in Punjab. The police became increasingly
effective in its operations. By 1993, Punjab had
been virtually freed of terrorism. Last political
heavy weight to sacrifice his life for peace in
Punjab was Beant Singh.
Former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh
was assassinated in a human bomb attack.
Dilawar Singh was the human bomb: A Special
Police Officer (SPO) with the Punjab Police, he
was assigned the task of assassinating Beant
Singh. He was wearing an explosive belt
underneath his uniform, reached Beant Singh
when the CM had just stepped to his car outside
assembly and pressed the trigger. Jagtar Singh
Hawara, a member of the Babbar Khalsa
International (BKI) terrorist group headed by
Wadhawa Singh, was the mastermind behind
the whole operation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WEST BENGAL Politics</i></strong></div>

After emergency, CPM, alongwith its left
allies, was able to form the government after an
electoral victory in 1977. After coming to power
the CPM launched the programme called
'Operation Barga'. This reformed the tenancy
system in the interests of the bargadars
(sharecroppers), who constituted nearly 25 per
cent of the rural households. 'Operation Barga'
included politicization and mobilization of
sharecroppers. The government secured legal
registration of sharecroppers, thus giving them
permanent lease of the land they cultivated and
security of tenure. Government enforced laws
regarding the share of the produce they could
retain. Significantly reform of the jotedari system
provided the incentive to all concerned to
increase production. It became a contributory
factore in the ushering in of the Green Revolution
and multi-cropping.
<br>
<br>
The second major change introduced by West
Bengal government was its restructuring and
transformation of the Panchayati Raj
institutions, through which the rural poor were
empowered to participate in political power. The
'Food for Work' programme was also
implemented effectively to generate jobs for the
landless. The CPM government's record in
containing communal violence has been
praiseworthy. Despite having a high ratio of
Muslims in the population and the large influx
of Hindu refuges from East Bengal, West Bengal
remained relatively free of communal violence.
In 1984, it contained the communal fallout of
Indira Gandhi's assassination and in December
1992 of the Babri Mosque's demolition.
Jyoti Basu headed West Bengal from 1977 to
2000, the longest serving CM in history who
almost became PM. His tenure symbolised the
mixed blessings of CPI(M)'s rule: land reform and
a robustly secular politics on the one hand;
industrial flight, economic stagnation and the
systematic politicisation of the state's
bureaucracy on the other.
<br>
<br>
Off late, Mamata Banerjee of Trinamool
Congress brought the change in politics of West
Bengal. “The catalysts” for the change were
Singur, Nandigram and Lalgarh. These
movements resurrected Mamata Banerjee’s
political career and essentially brought about her
to the centrestage. Mamata Banerjee translated
the anger against communists into votes, seats
and a government that would replaced a regime
of 34 years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gorkhaland Territorial Administration</i></strong></div>

In 1986, the Gorkha National Liberation
Front (GNLF) was organized under the
leadership of Subhash Gheising. It started an
agitation in the hill district of Darjeeling in West
Bengal around the demand for a separate
Gorkha state. After negotiations between GNLF
and the central and state governments, a
tripartite accord was signed in Calcutta in
August 1988, under which the semi-autonomous
Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council came into being.
The Council had wide control over finance,
education, health, agriculture and economic
development.
<br>
<br>
Lately Bimal Gurung’s GJM has emerged as
the main political force in the area. A tripartite
agreement paving the way for the setting up of
the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration
(GTA), an elected body for the Darjeeling hills,
has been signed. West Bengal Chief Minister
Mamata Banerjee and GJM president Bimal
Gurung and Central Government were 3 Parties
concerned. The new set-up will have 50
members: 45 of them will be elected and the rest
nominated.
<br>
<br>
As large numbers of Gorkhas sang and
danced at the site to celebrate the signing of the
accord, there was a complete shutdown in the
nearby town of Siliguri and parts of the Dooars
and Terai regions on the plains of north Bengal.
Mr. Gurung has reiterated the demand for the
inclusion, under the GTA, of the Terai and
Dooars regions. A committee set up for the
inclusion of areas in the Dooars and the Terai
has recommended for meager areal inclusion
and this may provide flash point in future. The
government will also have to pay attention to
this issue.
<br>
<br>
The long-running agitation for a Gorkhaland
State in the hills was propelled by ethnic and
linguistic passions. A lesson the West Bengal
Government appears to have picked up from
history is that these passions can often turn
disruptive unless adequately addressed. Hence
there is a need to amend Article 371 to provide
a constitutional guarantee to the DGHC rather
than continue to accept its functioning under a
State Act. There is also a need to formulate an
approach paper at the political level seeking to
safeguard the interests of the Gorkhas as a
dominant ethnic community with a distinctive
social and linguistic identity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CONUNDRUM OF TAMIL POLITICS</i></strong></div>

The DMK emerged in the 1950s as a party
which thrived on strong caste, regional and even
secessionist sentiments in initial phases. It was
amalgamation of two strands of the Preindependence period movements in Tamil Nadu:
the non-Brahmin movement (pro-British Justice
party in 1920), and the reformist anti-caste, antireligion Self Respect movement (led by
E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker, popularly known as
Periyar).
<br>
<br>
In 1944, Naicker and C.N. Annadurai
established Dravida Kazhagam (Federation) or
DK which split in 1949 when Annadurai
founded the Dravida Munnetra (Progressive)
Kazhagam (DMK). If Periyar launched the
Dravidian movement, Annadurai gave it
political form by founding the Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam in 1949. He fought for the
upliftment of non-Bhrahmins, led the anti-Hindi
agitation; he also gave Madras its name Tamil
Nadu. His legacy still inspires politics in the state.
In contrast to the Justice Party and Naicker,
Annadurai had taken up a strongly antiimperialist, pro-nationalist position before 1947.
The DMK was strongly anti-Brahmin, antiNorth and anti-Aryan. Southern Brahmins and
North Indians being seen as Aryans, all other
South Indians were seen as Dravidas. It raised
the slogan of opposition to the cultural, economic
and political domination of the South by the
North. Naicker and others had in 1938
organized a movement against the decision of
the Congress ministry to introduce Hindi in
Madras schools, labelling it to be an aspect of
Brahminical North Indian domination. Its main
demand, however, was for a homeland for the
Dravidas in the form of a separate independent
South Indian State Dravidnadu or Dravidasthan
consisting of Tamil Nadu, Andhra, Karnataka
and Kerala.
<br>
<br>
Gradually focus was shifted from race to
Tamil consciousness and Tamil Pride. However,
opposition to Hindi and emphasis on radical
social reforms was retained. The DMK
immediately amended its constitution and gave
up the demand for secession. From secessionism
it shifted to the demands for greater state
autonomy and more powers to the states.
DMK wanted for limiting the powers of the
central government, an end to the domination
and unfair treatment of the South by the Hindispeaking North, and allocation of greater central
economic resources for the development of Tamil
Nadu.
<br>
<br>
In 1967 elections DMK in alliance with other
parties got 138 of the 234 seats in assembly, with
Congress getting only 49. The DMK formed the
government in the state with Annadurai as chief
minister. After Annadurai's death in February
1969, M. Karunanidhi became the Chief
Minister. In 1972 the DMK split, with MGR
forming the All-India Anna DMK (AIADMK).
For 25 years, Maruthur Gopala Ramachandran
was the biggest star in Tamil Cinema. He turned
his fan base into political power, founding the
AIDMK, serving as CM for then continuous
years. His greatest legacy was the mid-day meal
scheme which at one stroke got kids into schools,
improved literacy and addressed malnutrition.
The two party system now emerged in Tamil
Nadu, but operated between the two Dravida
parties, with both parties alternating in power
in the state.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SHADES OF ANDHRA POLITICS</i></strong></div>

First and foremost story in Andhra politics
has to be related to Telangana Peasant Struggle.
The Telangana or Telugu-speaking area of
Hyderabad state ruled by the autocratic Nizam
had been experiencing political opposition since
the late 1930s under the influence of nationalist
and democratic organizations such as the State
Congress and the Andhra Mahasabha. From the
early 1940s, the communists emerged as a major
force and when the ban on the CPI was lifted by
the British in 1942 due to their pro-war line, they
quickly expanded their influence and established
their control on the Andhra Mahasabha. The
peasants in Telangana suffered extreme feudaltype oppression at the hands of Jagirdars and
Deshmukhs, some of whom owned thousands
of areas of land. The communists began to
organize the peasants against the hated forced
grain levy imposed by the government and veth
begar or forced labour extracted by landlords
and officials.
<br>
<br>
From 1945, helped along by a few incidents
in which the Communists heroically defended
the poor peasants, the peasant movement began
to spread rapidly. The Communists participated
actively in the anti-Nizam, pro-integration
movement, and it is in this phase, August 1947
to September 1948, when they rode the antiNizam pro-India wave, that they registered their
greatest successes, establishing a firm base in the
Nalgonda, Warangal and Khammam districts.
Landlord and officials mostly ran away to the
towns, leaving the field free for the Communists
in the villages. Lands that had been taken over
by landlords in lieu of debt claims in large
numbers during the Great Depression of the
1930s were returned to the original owners,
government owned uncultivated waste and
forests land was distributed to the landless. As
confidence grew, ‘ceilings’ on landlords’ land
were declared, first at 500 acres and then at 100
acres, and the ‘surplus’ land distributed to
landless and small peasants. On 13 September,
1948, after having waited for more than a year
for the Nizam to see the writing on the wall and
once the anti-Nizam resistance movement had
shown clearly what the people desired, the
Indian army moved into Hyderabad. The people
greeted it as an army of liberation and within
days the Nizam and his troops surrendered. The
government was quick to respond to the
issuances raised by the movement.
<br>
<br>
The Jagiradari Abolition Regulation was laid
down in 1949 itself and the Hyderabad Tenancy
and Agricultural Lands Act was passed in 1950.
Over 600,000 tenants covering over one quarter
of the cultivated area were declared ‘protected’
tenants with a right to purchase the land on easy
terms. Land ceiling were also introduced in the
mid-1950s. Landlords who returned after the
movement collapsed were not able to go back to
the old ways. The movement had broken the
back of landlordism in Telangana, but this had
already been done as part of the anti-Nizam,
pro-integration liberation struggle, when their
position as leaders of popular upsurge provided
Communists the opportunity to articulate radical
peasant demands as well. The costly adventure
thereafter was not dictated by the imperatives
of the peasant movement but was entirely a
consequence of misguided resolution any
romanticism, of which some Indian Communists
appeared to be enamoured.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Demand for separate Andhra</i></strong></div>

Andhra was created as a separate State in
October 1953 and in November 1956 the Telugu
speaking Telangana area of Nizam's Hyderabad
state was merged with it to create Andhra
Pradesh. A large unilingual state was supposed
to strengthen and bond the Telugu people
culturally, politically and economically.
A powerful movement for a separate state
of Telangana developed in 1969 based on the
belief that because the politics and administration of the state were dominated by people
from the Andhra region. People alleged that the
Andhra Government had neglected Telangana
and had done very little to remove the regional
economic imbalance. Andhrans were accused of
exploiting the Telangana region.
The major issue in this context became the
implementation of Mulki Rules. The Nizam's
government in Hyderabad had accepted earlier
that in all state services those who were born in
the state or had lived there for fifteen years (i.e.,
(Mulkis) would be given preference. At the same
time restrictions would be imposed on the
employment of outsiders. The discontented in
Telangana accused the government of deliberately violating the agreement. To lead the
movement for a separate Telangana state in an
organized manner, the Telangana Praja Samiti
(TPS) was soon formed. However, movement for
a separate Telangana began to lose stream after
the summer of 1969.
<br>
<br>
The TPS merged with Congress in September
1971 after Brahmanand Reddy, the Chief
minister, resigned and was replaced by P.V.
Narasimha Rao from Telangana. Now the middle
classes of the Andhra region started to protest
against Mulki Rules. To solve the impasse, central
government put forward a six-point formula
which did away with the Mulki Rules but
extended preference in employment and
education to all districts and regions of the state
over outsiders. The 32nd Constitutional
Amendment was passed to enable the
implementation of the formula.
In the case of both the Telangana and
Andhra regions, the central government firmly
and successfully opposed the demand for
bifurcation of the state as it was apprehensive
of similar demands being raised in other parts
of the country. But recent contours of struggle
for Telangana Separation have stretched the
situation to the extreme. The Home Minister
Chidambaram’s statement about initiating the
process of forming the new state was prompted
by Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS) party chief
K. Chandrasekhara Rao’s resolve to fast unto
death and violent protests in state capital
Hyderabad.
<br>
<br>
Since its inception, demands for a separate
Telangana state, formed out of 10 districts of
Andhra Pradesh, has seen violent protests and
political power play, with more than 300 people
killed between 1969 and 1972. The Congress’
electoral alliance with TRS in the state in 2004
was based on promises of delivering Telangana
to its leaders and was included in its Common
Minimum Programme. However, Telangana
supporters accused the Congress of backtracking
following its two electoral wins. Though, recent
developments point to the possibility that
Telangana can soon become the youngest state
of Indian Union. A brief account of controversial
points follows.
<br>
<br>
One major issues that seem to be at the centre
of the contention between the two regions of
Andhra Pradesh is the future of Hyderabad after
the division of the State. Hyderabad is an integral
part of Telangana and a Telangana State without
Hyderabad as the capital is inconceivable.
However, the militant rhetoric of some political
parties has made people of other areas feel
unwelcome, creating an air of mistrust among
the Telugu-speaking people of various regions.
Rhetorical slogans such as 'Telangana waalon
jaago, Andhra waalon bhago' gives the
impression of an exclusionist movement. When
Maharashtra and Gujarat were created from the
then Bombay state on the recommendation of
the States Reorganisation Commission, there was
also a fear about Mumbai losing its importance
as a financial nerve-centre as a lot of investment
in Mumbai had been made by Gujarati business
people. The creation of two separate States did
not halt Mumbai’s rapid development. In fact, it
additionally paved the way for the development
of Ahmedabad and Surat as alternative
financial centres. Hyderabad can emulate the
same model. The Telangana agitation is the only
such movement in India that involves a capital
city located in the region that is fighting for
separation from the main State. This clearly
reflects on the lack of governance and civic
administration in this area as the benefits of
having a State capital in the hinterland have not
trickled down to other areas in that region.
 Justice Srikrishna Committee has held wide
consultations on demands for a separate State
of Telangana as well as for keeping Andhra
Pradesh united, and offered half-a-dozen
options on which the government may take a
call. The suggestions include keeping Andhra
Pradesh in the present form, forming a separate
Telangana, and making Hyderabad a Union
Territory.
<br>
<br>
By acknowledging the merits of the
longstanding grievances of the people of the
Telangana region and recommending robust
“constitutional/statutory measures” – centred
on a Telangana Regional Council – for the “socioeconomic development and political
empowerment” of the region within a united
Andhra Pradesh as “the best way forward,” the
Committee for Consultations on the Situation in
Andhra Pradesh headed by retired Supreme
Court judge B.N. Srikrishna has tried to find a
just and equitable solution to the problem. The
statutory and empowered Regional Council
would be provided with “adequate transfer of
funds, functions and functionaries” and would
also act as “a legislative consultative mechanism”
for the subjects it would deal with.
After weighing five other options, the
Committee is of the opinion that this is the most
workable option in the given circumstances and
in the best interest of the social and economic
welfare of the people of all the three regions. The
core issues, the Committee emphasised, are
socio-economic development and good governance. The united Andhra Pradesh option,
premised on far-going and meaningful regional
autonomy for Telangana, is recommended for
“continuing the development momentum” of all
three regions and “keeping in mind the national
perspective.” Crucially, it would end the
uncertainty over the future of Hyderabad. The
“second best option” – bifurcation of the State
into Telangana and Seemandhra with their
existing boundaries and with Hyderabad as the
capital of the former and a new capital for
Seemandhra – is clearly a distant second. The
Committee's view is that this option should be
exercised only if it becomes unavoidable and all
three regions come to an amicable agreement on
it. But Telangana has been declared as the 29th
State of India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NORTH EAST REORGANIZATION</i></strong></div>

Soon after India’s independence, vested
interests started promoting sentiment in favour
of separate and independent states in northeastern India. The virtual absence of any political
or cultural contact of the tribals in the NorthEast with the political life of the rest of India was
also a striking difference. The struggle for
independence had little impact among the tribals
of the North-East. To quote Jawaharlal Nehru:
‘the essence of our struggle for freedom was the
unleashing of a liberating force in India. This
force did not even affect the frontier people in
one of the most important tribal areas.’ Again:
‘thus, they never experienced a sensation of
being in a country called India and they were
hardly influenced by the struggle for freedom or
other movements in India. Their chief experience
of outsiders was that of British officers and
Christian missionaries who generally tried to
make them anti-Indian.’
<br>
<br>
Sixth Schedule of the Constitution offered a
fair degree of self-government to the tribal people
by providing for autonomous districts and the
creation of district and regional councils, which
would exercise some of the legislative and
judicial functions within the overall jurisdiction
of the Assam legislature and the parliament. The
objective of the Sixth Schedule was to enable
tribals to live according to their own ways. The
Government of India also expressed its
willingness to further amend the constitutional
provisions relating to the tribal people if it was
found necessary to do so with a view to promote
further autonomy. However, this did not mean,
Nehru clarified that the government would
countenance secession from India or
independence by any area or region, or would
tolerate violence in the promotion of any
demands.
<br>
<br>
Nehru’s and Verrier Elwin’s policies were
implemented best of all in the North-East Frontier
Agency or NEFA, which was created in 1948
out of the border areas of Assam. NEFA was
established as a Union Territory outside the
jurisdiction of Assam and placed under a special
administration. From the beginning, the
administration was manned by a special cadre
of officers to implement specially designed
developmental policies without disturbing the
social and cultural pattern of the life of the
people.
NEFA was named Arunachal Pradesh and
granted the status of a separate state in 1987.
Soon problems developed in the other tribal areas,
which were part of Assam administratively. The
problems arose because the hill tribes of Assam
had no cultural affinity with the Assamese and
Bengali residents of the plains. The tribals were
afraid of losing their identities and being
assimilated by what was seen to be a policy of
Assamization.
<br>
<br>
The creation of Nagaland as a separate state
had its own peculiarities. The Naga tribes along
the Assam-Burma border had never been fully
controlled by the British and the problem was
further complicated on account of the large scale
conversion of the Naga tribes to Christianity by
American Baptist missionaries. There was a-long
entrenched rebellion led by the Naga leader A.Z.
Phizo, but the traditional leadership of the Naga
tribes under the Naga People’s Convention
wanted a settlement “within the Indian Union”.
Ultimately in 1963, Nagaland was created as a
separate State.
In the early 1980s, in Nagaland, the Naga
National Council (NNC), political face of the
oldest of the insurgencies in the region, was led
by Angami Zapu Phizo, then in exile in Britain.
Despite the challenge posed by a faction of the
NNC that had split and formed itself into the
National Socialist Council of Nagaland (NSCN),
the NNC remained the dominant voice of Naga
nationalistic assertion. In Manipur, Naga
insurgency was active those days in the Nagainhabited hill districts mainly in Tamenglong,
while in the Imphal Valley, several outfits, some
of them fighting one another as much as the
Indian state, were active: the United National
Liberation Front (UNLF), the Peoples' Liberation
Army (PLA), the People's Revolutionary Party
of Kangleipak (PREPAK) and the Kangleipak
Communist Party (KCP). In the Union Territory
of Mizo Hills, the Mizo National Front (MNF)
arrived at the Talk-Talk-Fight-Fight stage, and
was on the way to give up its secessionist
agenda, sign a peace accord and become a
legitimate party of the government. Insurgency
had not become a generalised fact of life in the
region including Assam, though formally the
United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) had
been founded in April 1979.
<br>
<br>
The objectives of all these organisations,
including the nascent ULFA, were broadly the
same: independence and sovereignty, the
restoration of sovereignty that ‘lapsed' to the
people these organisations claimed to represent
when the British left India but which India
refused to concede. The undeniable historical fact
underlying this idea of restoration of sovereignty'
as against the demand for sovereignty' is that
beginning with the British annexation of Assam
following the defeat of Burma in 1826 in the First
Anglo-Burmese War, the colonial government
had embarked on consolidating the boundaries
of these newly acquired vast territories,
progressively annexing more of these
borderlands and extending its own boundaries.
<br>
<br>
NNC split that led to the formation of the
NSCN in early 1980. Even though the NSCN in
due course also split into two factions, and the
NNC has refused to fade away, the NSCN (I and
M) bearing the initials of Chairman Isak Swu
and General Secretary Thuingaleng Muivah
remains the dominant voice of the sovereignty
aspirations of the Naga people.
However, all these insist that settlement of
the “Naga political issue,” that is restoration of
Naga sovereignty and independence — the
resolution of what has come to be known in the
Naga nationalist rhetoric as “the mother of all
insurgencies” in the region — is central to
resolving the other problems in the region. This
perspective has been expressed several times by
Muivah since the NSCN(I-M) began talking
directly to the Government of India nearly 15
years ago. During this period, the NSCN(I-M)
leaders have met several Prime Ministers in
foreign lands and in India, and have had
prolonged dialogue with, interlocutors, initially
in cities in Europe and South East Asia, and later
in Delhi. Peace of a kind has prevailed in
Nagaland and in the Naga inhabited areas of
Manipur, though the “Naga political issue”
remains unresolved.
<br>
<br>
The irony in the northeast is that armed
insurgencies coexist with the enthusiasm for the
electoral process. The debate on the politics of
the northeast has rested on the region’s
alienation and marginalisation from mainstream
politics. The astounding number of organised
insurgencies in the region, party politics
notwithstanding, gives credence to the idea that
the northeast has substantial grievances against
the Indian state. Yet, in recent assembly elections
in the insurgency-hit States of Meghalaya,
Nagaland and Tripura, the incumbents were
voted back into power and voter turnout was
unprecedentedly high – Tripura had a voter
turnout of 93 per cent, followed by Meghalaya
at 88 per cent and Nagaland at 83.2 per cent.
Some celebrate the high voter turnout and
political stability (amidst relative peace) as an
indicator of northeastern people’s leap of faith
in New Delhi’s politically accommodative
strategies. Others lament that the northeast has
continued to be peripheral in India’s national
political imagination and therefore successful
elections in the region should not be seen as an
extension of legitimacy for the Indian state.
Historically, the northeast has been thought of
by New Delhi as a region riddled with
exceptions in three different areas — the people’s
racial and tribal difference, their geographic
isolation which enabled a perceived nonparticipation in the national movement and
finally, the spread of Christianity as a dominant
religion in Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Assamese Story</i></strong></div>

The Assamese had a grievance that the severe
underdevelopment of Assam was due to unfair
treatment by the central government. It was
alleged that central government had not only
neglected its development but also discriminated
against it in allocation of central funds. At the
same time, centre was seen as having deprived
Assam of its due share of revenues from its crude
oil and tea and plywood industries. There were
demands for a greater share for Assam in the
revenues derived from tea and plywood
industries and a higher royalty for its crude oil.
Other demands included larger central financial
grants and plan allocation and location of oil
refineries in Assam, so that there is no need to
send the oil to Barauni refinery. In infrastructure,
demands included construction of more bridges
over the Brahmaputra river and upgrading of
the railway link between Assam and the rest of
India.
<br>
<br>
Reservation was demanded for locals to
ensure greater employment of Assamese in
central government services and public sector
enterprises located in the state. There was also a
strong feeling among the Assamese speakers that
Bengali predominance in education and middleclass jobs also posed a threat to the Assamese
language and culture. The movement for a
change in the official language led to the rounds
of hostility between Bengali and Assamese
speakers. In July 1960, language riots erupted.
In 1960, the state assembly passed a law making
Assamese the sole official language, though
Bengali remained the additional official language
in Cachar. It was done against the wishes of
Bengali speakers and many tribal groups.
Later, a massive anti-foreigners movement
started in 1979. Main reason was the large-scale
illegal migration from Bangladesh and to some
extent from Nepal. The demographic transformation of Assam created apprehension
among many Assamese that the swamping of
Assam by foreigners and non-Assamese Indians
would lead to the Assamese being reduced to a
minority in their own land and consequently to
the subordination of their culture.
At the end of 1979, the All Assam Students
Union (ASSU) and the Assam Gana Sangram
Parishad (Assam People's Struggle Council), a
coalition of regional associations, started a
massive, anti-illegal migration movement. This
campaign won the support of many sections of
Assamese society. The years from 1979 to 1985
witnessed political instability. Election to the state
assembly in 1983 led to its large scale boycott.
The Congress party did form the government,
but it lacked legitimacy.
<br>
<br>
Finally, the Rajiv Gandhi government signed
an accord with the leaders of the movement on
15 August, 1985. All those foreigners who had
entered Assam between 1951 and 1961 were to
be given full citizenship, including the right
to vote; those who had done so after 1971 were
to be deported; the entrants between 1961 and
1971 were to be denied voting rights for ten years
but would enjoy all other rights of citizenship.
A parallel package for the economic development of Assam, including a second oil refinery,
a paper mill and an institute of technology, was
also promised. The central government also
promised to provide 'legislative and
administrative safeguards' to protect the
cultural, social, and linguistic identity and
heritage of the Assamese people. Fresh elections
were held in December 1985. Prafulla Mahanta,
an AASU leader, became the youngest chief
minister of independent India. Extreme and
prolonged political turbulence in Assam ended,
though fresh insurgencies came later e.g.
demand of Bodo tribes for a separate state and
of the secessionist United Liberation Front of
Assam ULFA.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Democracy in North East</i></strong></div>

The democratic health of any country is not
only indicated by robust voter turnouts, regular
elections, but also by the State’s ability to further
the rights of people, deliver public goods and
maintain peace. The strong pro-incumbent trend
coupled with high voter turnouts and regular
elections suggests that democracy works well in
the northeast. Yet, we see the persistence of
insurgent groups in all three States under
discussion.
<br>
<br>
There are two distinct political processes at
work in the northeast - the party political process
demonstrated through electoral politics and the
non-party political process found in the form of
long-running insurgencies. Both these processes
mutually support each other. The non-party
political process has evolved in reaction to
grievances against the Indian state and in
synergy with electoral politics.
Even though there were regular allegations
of vote-buying in some districts of Nagaland, the
Congress regularly came to power in most
northeastern States until vibrant student
movements allowed for regional formations like
the Asom Gana Parishad and the Bodoland
People’s Front (Assam), Khun Hynniewtrep
National Awakening Movement (in Meghalaya)
and the Naga People’s Front (Nagaland) to
emerge.
<br>
<br>
Over time, violent counterinsurgency gave
way to ceasefires, negotiations and policies of
surrender. This allowed many northeastern
insurgent groups to scale down their political
demands from outright secession to limited
autonomy within the Union of India. This was
granted to them under the Sixth Schedule in the
form of autonomous districts. The pacts with
insurgent groups have also led to former
insurgents being incorporated into mainstream
politics. In this manner, many former insurgents
have been playing crucial political roles in the
region.
However insurgencies in the northeast have
also acquired a momentum of their own. In
Meghalaya, Assam, Nagaland and Manipur,
insurgent groups are often reported to act like
mafias or cartels running extortion, drugs,
kidnapping and small arms rackets. The rents
extracted from these illegal activities often sustain
the groups’ organisational needs and create
incentives for new recruits. Massive
unemployment in the region makes insurgency
a lucrative career amongst disaffected and
marginalised tribal youths within the northeast.
On top of this, the State’s coercive techniques
continue to add fuel to the fire.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEED FOR SECOND SRC</i></strong></div>

In 1956, the first SRC had reorganized states
along linguistic lines. However, more than 6
decades later, the idea of linguistic identity
forming the basis of statehood has become
outdated. Today the demand for smaller states
is increasingly driven by socio-economic
aspirations. A second SRC would do well to
study these factors and pronounce its verdict on
the viability of the statehood demands. This
would also guard against fringe movements
holding the Centre and the idea of India to
ransom.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Beyond Language</i></strong></div>

Nehru warned against any kind of
passionate surge in demand for separate States
based on an exclusive ideology of language or
religion. He wanted large States to retain their
cosmopolitan character. He was not fully
convinced of the viability and durability of
monolingual States. Whereas, Ambedkar, as
Chairman of the Drafting Committee of the
Indian Constitution, supported the demand for
reorganisation of States on a linguistic basis. He
considered four basic principles such as
development, efficiency, equality and democracy
for ushering in the era of reorganisation of States.
Ambedkar proposed that each State may
have its own language for purposes of
administrative communication with the Centre
and other States, but disregarded the thesis of
“one language, one state”. In other words, his
view was that people speaking the same language
need not be grouped into one State but there
could be more than one State with the same
language. The formula of one State, one
language, he pointed out, was not to be equated
with one language, one State. Instead, people
speaking one language might find themselves in
many States depending upon other factors such
as the requirements of administrative efficiency,
specific needs of particular areas and the
proportion between the majority and minority
communities within a State.
<br>
<br>
For Ambedkar, States in a democratic polity
needed to have equitable size limits since this
would ensure proportional distribution of
resources among the States as well as their
inhabitants. Like Nehru, he too favoured a
strong Centre to ensure an equitable survival of
different languages, cultures, regions and States
within a broader framework of an inclusive
developmental polity.
<br>
<br>
After Independence, the demand for the
reorganisation of states along linguistic lines
overshadowed such issues as size and economic
capability. Today, the situation has undergone
a substantial change. There are increasing
demands for carving out smaller states out of
the large, single-language states created after
Independence. In the contemporary postCongress and post-reform era, states have
emerged as important players determining
national political patterns. In many states, an
upsurge from below has brought the hitherto
underprivileged groups to power, creating new
political elites. And in the era of coalition
governments, regional or state parties have
become partners in central governance. The
current demand for the break-up of large states
like Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar
Pradesh needs to be examined seriously and
dispassionately in its historical and
contemporary context.
<br>
<br>
Smaller states within the same linguistic
regions are desirable when history,
administrative efficiency, dialect, or any other
strong characteristic renders new statehood
desirable. Thus, the Nizam’s rule in Hyderabad
has given the people of Telangana a distinct
identity. Portuguese rule in Goa has set it apart
from other Marathi speaking areas. To ignore
such differences arising from history would be
denying the affirmation of healthy local pride.
The establishment of a market economy, too,
has opened the floodgates to private capital that
has led to increasing regional inequalities and,
thus, contributed to the rising demands for
smaller states. Economic backwardness of subregions within large states has also emerged as
an important ground on which demands for
smaller states are being made. This is evident
from the immediate demands for the formation
of Vidharbha, Bodoland and Saurashtra, among
other states. These developments have been
responsible for a shift away from issues of
language and culture – which had shaped the
earlier process of reorganisation – to those of
better governance and greater participation,
administrative convenience, economic viability
and similarity in the developmental needs of subregions.
In this situation, the move towards smaller
states appears to be inevitable and would lead
to more democratisation. The formation of three
new states in 2000 – Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh
and Uttarakhand – has provided a fillip to this
process. Fresh parameters for the creation of
States have to be based on holistic development
on economic and social lines for better
administration and management. This fact has
been proven with the creation of Chhattisgarh
from Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand from Bihar
and Uttaranchal from Uttar Pradesh. The case
for small States can be argued with
macroeconomic statistics from the Ministry of
Statistics and Programme Implementation.
Between 1999-2000, when the smaller States
were created, and 2007-2008, India’s overall
GDP increased by 75 per cent during this time
period. During the same period, Jharkhand,
Chhattisgarh and Uttaranchal recorded more
than 100 per cent, 150 per cent and 180 per cent
increase respectively.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>New Demands</i></strong></div>

In the long journey of reorganisation from
14 to 28 States, the Centre changed a few
principles into guidelines to deal with demands
for further redrawing of existing State
boundaries. These principles, according to Paul
Brass are as follows: A. demands must stop short
of secession; B. demands based on language and
culture could be accommodated, but not those
based explicitly on religious differences; C.
demands must have clearly demonstrated public
support; and D. division of multilingual states
must have some support from different linguistic
groups.
<br>
<br>
Except the major demands such as Bodoland
(Assam), Gorkhaland (West Bengal), Haripradesh
(Uttar Pradesh), Vidarbha (Maharashtra) and
Kodagu, or Coorg (Karnataka), not much is
known about the remaining 26 or so demands
reportedly pending for consideration before the
government. There has been a significant shift
from language and culture that shaped the earlier
process of reorganisation to the one driven by
specific needs of the political economy of
development and socio-cultural inclusion.
This whole process of rise in demands took
so long. Reason lies in history. The colonial state
supported commercial agriculture and industry
in selected areas such as the coastal regions,
deltas, river valleys and mineral-rich areas,
leaving the vast hinterland underdeveloped.
Such a distorted pattern of unequal development
continued in the post-Independence period as
well. The result has been uneven development
in the big States of India: some districts that have
seen rapid development are surrounded by
poorer regions that remain backward and underdeveloped. E.g. Bundelkhand, Poorvanchal,
Vidarbha and the inner tribal regions of Orissa
have continued to remain deprived within large
States. The three small States of Chhattisgarh,
Uttarakhand and Jharkhand, which came into
existence in 2000, were not created on linguistic
and cultural grounds. These three States are not
performing badly.
<br>
<br>
There are demands for Harit Pradesh and
Bundelkhand in UP, Maru Pradesh in Rajasthan,
Coorg in Karnataka, Vidharbha in Maharastra,
Bodoland in Assam and Gorkhaland in West
Bengal. A full-fledged exercise is needed for a
federal reorganisation of the country by
appointing of a Second States Reorganisation
Commission.
Justified Demands or Political Demands
It is being argued that federal reorganisation
of India into smaller States would not only fulfill
the political aspirations of the people of the
backward regions but would also ensure their
rapid economic development. It would
accelerate the pace of modernisation (in those
States) by increasing administrative efficiency
and bringing the administration closer to the
people there. E.g. rapid progress was made by
Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh in a
short span of time after their creation on
November 1, 1966. It has been further argued
that the accordance of Statehood to various
regions would also resolve the problem of
identity-crisis in them. This would enable them
to develop their language and culture. It would
help them in getting rid of the feelings of internal
colonialism. The reorganisation of the country
into small States would also make the federation
more balanced by making the representation of
the present large-sized States, like UP, MP and
Maharashtra, and the small States, like Punjab,
Haryana and Himachal Pradesh, more
proportionate.
<br>
<br>
As a result of Nehru’s determination to deal
firmly with any secessionist movement, the 16th
Constitutional Amendment was passed in 1962
declaring the advocacy of secession a crime and
requiring every candidate to parliament or state
assembly to swear ‘allegiance to the Constitution’
and to ‘uphold the sovereignty and integrity of
India.’ But such trends are more of a past
phenomenon. Today, fears of the Centre
weakening due to the creation of a large number
of small states are unfounded. Many small states
were created after 1956 - Punjab, Haryana and
some in the north-east – which strengthened
rather than weakened the Union. Even as the
older federal structure served the polity created
at Independence, there is a need to redraw the
map of India in keeping with the new social and
political order. The demand for smaller states is
based on the principle that in a true democracy
- which India is supposed to be – there must be
grassroots representation. In other words, the
people running the show in any particular
administrative area must be aware of, and
sympathetic to, the needs and aspirations of the
general population which inhibits that area.
Larger States can become hegemonic and
undemocratic through their numerical strength
and command over natural and physical
resources, which can have a serious impact on
the federal democratic structure of the country.
At the same time States Reorganisation Act,
1956 also needs a fresh look to determine
whether division on linguistic lines has facilitated
development or there is need to look at the whole
issue from a wholistic and/or alternative view.
Granting greater autonomy and empowering
local bodies is one way to ensure that the fruits
of development get evenly distributed, and
satiate regional aspirations.
<br>
<br>
The emergence of regional parties and their
importance in coalitions formed at the Centre to
form governments can push demands for
creating more States in the near future. This
should be welcomed as the continuing process
of democratization aiming to reach down to new
social groups and regions hitherto excluded from
the mainstream of governance.
It would not only create and increase
political consciousness among the disadvantaged
groups in the States, but also produce new local
and regional elites with participatory and
decision-making roles. Such a process, according
to them, is inevitable as regional inequalities
widen among the existing States under the
process of globalization creating more intense
competition for sharing resources in intersecting
regions and sub-regions of the States.
Whereas, division of the existing States is
often opposed on the grounds that it could
encourage centrifugal tendencies and lead to the
dismemberment of India. E.g. Arunachal Pradesh
is an extraordinary story. There is no parallel
between the success achieved there and anything
else in any part of the world. The State is a mosaic
of over 110 tribes of diverse racial and linguistic
stock but coming together through to acquire a
new sense of identity as Arunachalese Indians.
The grant of Statehood cannot guarantee
rapid economic development of those backward
regions which do not have the required material
and human resources for economic growth.
Moreover, some of the small States may not be
having the potential for economic viability. The
small States could also lead to the hegemony of
the dominant community/caste/tribe over their
power structures. There can develop in an
aggressive regionalism leading to the growth of
the sons-of-the-soil phenomenon and other ills
of aggressive regionalism.
<br>
<br>
The attainment of Statehood could also lead
to emergence of intra-regional rivalries among
the sub-regions as has happened in Himachal
Pradesh, religious communities as in Punjab and
castes/tribes as in Haryana and Manipur, if the
regional identity of the new States remains weak
due to demographic factors or historical reasons
or their cultural backwardness. The creation of
small States may also lead to certain negative
political consequences. The political opportunists,
power-brokers and power-hungry politicians
could hold the Chief Minister of a small State to
ransom. The case of Jharkhand, where even an
independent MLA manipulated to become the
Chief Minister, may be cited as an illustration.
Political demands for smaller states and
bifurcation arise for multiple reasons. There are,
of course, emotional considerations like culture,
language, religion and a sense of economic and
regional deprivation. But more importantly,
politicians envision additional posts of power as
chief ministers or ministers, leaders of the
opposition, Assembly speakers and so on.
Similarly, government servants think of
becoming chief secretaries or secretaries, DGs of
police, chief-engineers, directors and so on.
The more serious objection to ever-smaller
states is that such demands, based on the politics
of sub-regional identity, further erode India's
already threatened and fragile unity. It is often
said that Indians tend to be Gujaratis, or Tamils,
or Punjabis, or whatever else, first and Indians
second. Rabble-rousers have shown us the
dangers of regional chauvinism, and a sons-ofthe-soil policy. If each state, or sub-state, sprouts
its own home-grown version of the son of soil
policy the Indian union will soon be a disunion
of disparate parts.
<br>
<br>
Alternatively, in such States, the risk of
centralization of powers in the hands of few
would be rather greater. The administration of
such States would tend to be highly personalised
and politicized. Such a State would become a
fiefdom of the Chief Minister. This type of regime
has really been in existence in Haryana since its
very formation on November 1, 1966—except for
a few brief interludes—owing to its small size
both in terms of area and population.
Too often, the demand for smaller states is
not really based on genuine concerns about
administrative equity but is a disguised excuse
for a land-grab. The moment a new state is
formed, a new capital for it has to be established,
together with all the pomp and paraphernalia
of statehood: a new assembly, secretariat, and
so on. As a result, property prices in the newly
designated capital shoot up and the land mafia
hits the jackpot.
<br>
<br>
Evidence shows that both large and small
states have fared well and that poor
performance is not necessarily linked to size. In
fact, today, technology can help make governing
larger territories easier and bring even far-flung
areas closer. Much more than the size of a state,
it is the quality of governance and
administration, the diverse talent available
within the state’s population, and the
leadership’s drive and vision that determine
whether a particular state performs better than
the others.
<br>
<br>
At the same time, the creation of a federation
consisting of smaller states is a complex task and
requires careful attention. Many critics have
correctly argued that the mere creation of smaller
states out of the existing bigger ones does not
guarantee good governance and faster and
inclusive economic development. If the
administration in a large state suffers from
inefficiencies, there is no guarantee that it will
become competent by merely creating a smaller
state.
<br>
<br>
A common notion is that a larger share of
central funds would flow into a new state
compared to when it is a region in a larger state.
Most also believe that a new capital city would
provide better living conditions. Arguments are
set forth that a smaller state with less number of
districts would diminish the span of control of
state-level functionaries. And that reduced
distances between the state capital and
peripheral areas would improve the quality of
governance and administrative responsiveness
and accountability. However, this can easily be
achieved with strong regional administrative
units in larger states.
A small state is likely to face limitations in
terms of the natural (physical) and human
resources available to it. Moreover, it will lack
the kind of agro-climatic diversity required for
economic and developmental activities. It would
also be restricted in its capability to raise
resources internally. All these factors would only
make it more dependent on the Centre for
financial transfers and centrally-sponsored
schemes. Further, increasing the number of states
in the country would expand the span of control
of the central ministries dealing with states and
of party high commands dealing with state party
units.
<br>
<br>
A new small state may find itself lacking in
infrastructure (administrative and industrial),
which requires time, money and effort to build.
Some may argue that it is with this very purpose
of developing infrastructure that demands for
the creation of smaller states are encouraged. But
experience shows that it takes about a decade
for a new state and its government and
administrative institutions to become stable; for
various issues of division of assets, funds and of
the state civil service(s) to get fully resolved; and
for links to the new state capital to stabilise. The
cost of this transition is not low and the state’s
performance may suffer during this interim
period. Smaller states are not a panacea for
India’s myriad problems. Neither can they
resolve issues faced by various regions and
sections of society. Larger states may be, in fact,
more economically-and financially-viable and
better capable of serving people and achieving
planned development.
<br>
<br>
And last but not the least, the creation of
small States would lead to an appreciable
increase in the inter-State water, power and
boundary disputes; and apart from the strain on
their limited financial resources, these would
require huge funds for building new capitals and
maintaining a large number of Governors, Chief
Ministers, Ministers and Administrators—if the
existing states are reorganised into smaller states.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

Demand to constitute another States
Reorganization Commission to consider the
possibility of reorganising federal India into
States on a fairly rational basis cannot be ignored
for long. Second state reorganisation commission
is the need of the hour in Indian polity and all
the demands for separate statehood and sub
statehood are a political demand with electoral
underpinnings. "Racial and cultural identity
assertion, uneven development is often fraught
with strong grass-root movement for separate
state," (Prof. M.P. Singh). Democracy in India
had now been converted into ethnocracy and
delineated about various state movements in the
North East and other regions. Various
movements for separate states like Telangana,
Gorkhaland, Vidharbha, Seemanchal and many
others need urgent action on this front.
The reorganization of states throughout India
would be a huge task requiring time and
patience. But it should be undertaken and
accepted in principle immediately. While the
proposed Commission undertakes its task other
measures regarding a rational division of
responsibility between local, district, state and
central governments should also be studied.
India’s political system requires reappraisal in
its entirety. And announcement of a second SRC
can be the starting point in this journey.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FEDERALISM IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

India is a vast country, and even neighbouring
villages have different customs and traditions.
Also, the people follow different faiths, speak
different languages and live in many climatic
zones. In such a situation, it is desired that the
governance conforms to the regional conditions.
Federalism is an arrangement to apportion powers
between the Centre and the States, and
considered a feature of the Cabinet form of
governance. This means the governance should
be by the people of the region, and the basic laws
will have to be in line with the pattern of the
social life.
<br>
<br>
This is the reason that States have a certain
amount of independence in formulating policies
and implementing them. However, there may
be disputes between States, and in such cases
the intervention of the Centre becomes necessary.
The Centre should also see to it that the States
accept the decision that it takes.
The time is ripe now for establishing a true
federal system that will strengthen the bonds of
mutual cooperation, unity, and cordiality
between the Centre and the States. For proper
and ideal Centre-State relations, there should be
more powers for the States. To be more
appropriate and precise, there should be
autonomy for the States and federalism at the
Centre.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Demands for Autonomy</i></strong></div>

The demand for restructuring Centre-State
relations is as old as the adoption of the
Constitution of India in 1950. The creation of a
new structure of constitutional government for
independent India deserves to be seen in
historical context. In fact, political imperatives
emerging out of the independence movement
influenced the design of government incorporated in the Constitution. On the one hand,
the framers, drawing the spirit of the
independence movement, found the federal
scheme appropriate for India; on the other hand,
Partition created a fear of centrifugal elements
in the nascent nation.
<br>
<br>
Indeed, the major part of the history of the
struggle for self-rule and independence reflects
efforts to find a solution to India’s gigantic
diversity. Even the mobilisation for the national
movement was based on federal principles. The
acceptance of language as the basis for
redrawing the provincial boundary, for example,
was a result of such a mobilisation. The history
of federalism and Centre-State relations in India
is marked by political mobilisation and
intermittent struggle to fashion a more federal
set-up. Even though such efforts have not yet
resulted in any major constitutional changes
towards a more federal orientation, the struggle
has not been entirely fruitless.
In the phase lasting until the last 1960s, the
task of nation building and development was the
main concern of the nation’s rulers. However,
this period was not solely dominated by the trend
of centralisation. One of the major democratic
movements in the post-Independence period —
the movement for the formation of the linguistic
States – took place in the 1950s, which resulted
in the formation of linguistic States in 1956. The
Central government resisted this demand and
but later gave in – in the face of strong popular
movements. This laid the basis for the later
assertion by the States for greater powers.
The second phase began with the 1967
general elections. Non-Congress State Governments came into being. The demand for
restructuring of Centre-State relations picked up
momentum. An important feature of the 1967
elections was the coming together of the
Opposition parties; some of them formed antiCongress fronts in some states. In other cases,
they entered into a series of electoral adjustments
by sharing seats and avoiding contests. The
election results were dramatic and Congress
suffered a serious setback. Though it succeeded
in retaining control of the Lok Sabha-it won 284
out of 520 seats-its majority was drastically
reduced from 228 in 1963 to 48. In West Bengal
and Kerala, the left parties gained. Congress also
lost its majority in the assemblies of eight statesBihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, West
Bengal, Orissa, Madras and Kerala. The Jan
Sangh emerged as the main Opposition party in
Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana,
Swatantra in Orissa, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh
and Gujarat, the SSP in Bihar, and the
Communists in West Bengal and Kerala.
The 1967 elections revealed certain long-term
TRENDS AND ALSO HAD CERTAIN LONGTERM consequences. Apart from general disenchantment with Congress, defection by the rich
and middle peasants from the Congress camp
played a major role in the Congress debacle in
the northern states. The 1967 elections also
initiated the dual era of short-lived coalition
governments and politics of defection. Except the
DMK government in Tamil Nadu and the
Swatantra led government in Orissa, the
coalition governments in all the other states,
whether formed by Congress or the Opposition,
proved to be highly unstable. In Haryana, where
the defection phenomenon was first initiated,
defecting legislators began to be called 'Aya Ram
and Gaya Ram' (incoming Ram and outgoing
Ram). The 1967 elections drastically changed the
balance of power inside Congress. Its dominant
leadership in the form of the syndicate received
a major blow as several syndicate stalwarts,
including Kamaraj (its President), Atulya Ghosh
(West Bengal) and S.K. Patil (Bombay), lost
political ground to regional warlords.
Government under Desai was a short lived
one. Change at the top of political hierarchy did
not last long and results of the 1971 elections
turned out to be overwhelming personal triumph
for Indira Gandhi and a rude shock to the
Opposition. Congress (R) swept the polls,
winning 352 of the 518 Lok Sabha seats. This
gave the party a two-thirds minority required to
amend the constitution. The 1971 elections
restored the Congress party to its dominant
position in Indian politics. By voting for Congress
the people had simultaneously voted for change
and stability.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, in TN assembly, report of the
Rajamannar Committee was received in 1971.
On April 16, 1974, a historic resolution was
moved in the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly
requesting the Central Government to accept the
views and the recommendations of the
Rajamannar Committee and proceed to effect
immediate changes in the Constitution of India
to establish a truly federal set-up.
For the first time, in 1989, a National Front
Coalition Government headed by V.P. Singh,
which included major regional parties like took
office at the Centre. Though short-lived, this
government took certain steps to strengthen the
federal principle. The Inter-State Council was
constituted in 1990. The entry of regional parties
in coalition Governments at the Centre became
a regular feature in 1996 with the formation of
the United Front government and later in form
of NDA and presently in the United Progressive
Alliance Government. The Left parties, which
supported both the National Front Government
in 1989 and the United Front Government in
1996-1998 and the present UPA government, are
strong supporters of the federal principle.
Attempts have been made to impose a unitary
form of government in the country. The character
of India as a multinational, multilingual, multireligious state has been blatantly ignored. The
relevant recommendations of the Sarkaria
Commission on the restructuring of Centre-State
relations have not been accepted and
implemented in true spirit. As a result of which
there has been a persistent trend of centralisation
of economic and political powers in the country.
The time is ripe now for a transformation that
would strengthen the bonds of mutual
cooperation, unity, and cordiality between the
Centre and the States.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Financial Relations</i></strong></div>

Federal Constitutions everywhere are
characterised by an imbalance between the
functional responsibilities and the financial
powers at different levels of government. The
Indian Constitution, while expressly vesting the
Centre with greater powers of taxation, also
provides for an institutional mechanism — the
Finance Commission — to determine the share
of the States in the Central tax revenues by way
of correcting this imbalance.
<br>
<br>
In deciding on the devolution of taxes and
the provision of grants, the Finance Commission
is required to address the vertical imbalance
(between the Centre and the States) as also the
horizontal imbalance, the one between the States
with varying fiscal capacities but similar
responsibilities in the provision of public services.
The Centre gets a little over 60 per cent of the
total revenues. While the States are thus left with
less than 40 per cent of the revenue, their share
in revenue expenditure averaged about 57 percent. 
At present, about 40 per cent of Central
revenues (tax and non-tax) are transferred to the
States, and this includes the grants they get from
the Planning Commission and the Central
Ministries. Although the shareable pool has been
enlarged (thanks to the 80th Constitution
Amendment) to include all Central taxes, the
relative revenue accruals of the Centre and the
States have not seen any major change.
<br>
<br>
Nobody can deny that most of 2nd
generation reforms will require a cooperative
relation between 2 layers of governance. E.g. The
big question is -What will be the impact of the
proposed Goods and Services Tax (GST) on the
vertical imbalance? These reforms will have major
impact on relative financial strength in future
and will shape the contour the centre state
relations. The subject of Centre-State financial
relations in India has received much less
attention than it merits in public discourse.
Twelfth Finance Commission (TFC) not only
ushered in an era of rule-based fiscal
consolidation at the State level but also provided
the basis for reforms in the management of public
debt, both at the State and Central levels.
The fiscal capacities of the States as measured
by the per capita income continue to vary widely
even after six decades of federal financial
devolution and economic planning. The disparity
between the highest and the lowest is in the ratio
of four-to-one. As a consequence, there is an
uneven provision of public services across
different States, including 'merit goods' such as
education and health services.
This inter-State inequality on account of
differences in fiscal capacity is further
compounded by two factors. The States with low
income levels have a large population. It means
they have to transfer huge additional resources
if there has to be any impact at all. Further, some
States have certain “cost disabilities” because of
the vastness of the area or other geographical
and climatic factors. An explicit equalisation
methodology is yet to be developed to tackle this
systemic problem.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Way Forward</i></strong></div>

A number of the govt. proposals, including
the Prevention of Communal and Targeted
Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill
2011, Lokpal and Lokayuktas Bill 2011, National
Commission for Human Resources for Health
(NCHRH) Bill 2011, Border Security Force
(Amendment) Bill 2011, the setting up of the
National Counter-Terrorism Centre (NCTC) and
the issue of Central Sales Tax (CST)
compensation have received flak on the grounds
that the Centre is trying to destabilise the federal
structure by undermining the powers and
position of state governments.
The Inter-State Council (ISC), set up in 1990
following the recommendations of the Sarkaria
Commission, is eminently qualified to make a
contribution in today's scenario. Unfortunately,
it has been lying dormant for many years, with
its last meeting held in 2006. The full ISC did
not meet even once during P.V. Narasimha Rao's
tenure and it met only twice during the UPA 1
regime.
<br>
<br>
Caste-based political parties and casteist
political leaders are the emerging trends in
Indian politics. Mamata Banerjee, J. Jayalalithaa
and Nitish Kumar, who are championing the
cause of states today, are more interested in
getting better grants from centre rather than
emergence of true federalism. These defenders
of state rights have had no qualms in using
central intervention powers to suit the interests
of their respective parties. As allies in the 1998-
99 BJP-led coalition, the Trinamool Congress, the
AIADMK and the Samata Party had pressured
the Centre to dismiss the West Bengal, Tamil
Nadu and Bihar governments respectively.
Partisan role played by governor is another area
of discord between centre and states.
Only the spirit of “co-operative federalism”
— and not an attitude of dominance or
superiority — can preserve the balance between
the Union and the States and promote the good
of the people. Under our constitutional system,
no single entity can claim superiority.
Sovereignty does not lie in any one institution or
in any one wing of the government. The power
of governance is distributed in several organs and
institutions – a sine qua non for good governance.
Even if we assume that the Centre has been
given a certain dominance over the States, that
dominance should be used strictly for the
purpose intended, not for oblique purposes. An
unusual and extraordinary power like the one
contained in Article 356 should not be employed
for furthering the prospects of a political party
or to destabilise a duly elected government and
a duly constituted Legislative Assembly. A
dictatorial marshalling of the regions was never
envisaged by the Constitution makers. The
Article which allows a highly interventionist role
to the Centre should be reinterpreted in order to
allow the spirit of cooperative federalism to
emerge.
<br>
<br>
No federal system thrives exclusively on
constitutional or institutional arrangements,
guaranteed rights, judicial protection and
uniform and efficient bureaucracy. Because,
federalism implies political accommodation of
heterogeneous people. It is a sort of
gregariousness, a faith in the political values and
the will to live together called political culture.
Federalism at the moment stands at the
crossroads in India. With the regional parties at
the helm, the demand for greater political
autonomy for the states will keep on clashing
with the desire to have a stable government at
the Centre. And in this struggle will emerge the
true federalism for the country in 21st century.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAJOR ISSUES IN INDIAN
DEMOCRACY
COMMUNALISM</i></strong></div>

For a long time it was held that a close link
existed between the modernisation of society and
the secularisation of the population.
Consequently, it was argued that the influence
of religion declined in post-enlightenment
society. The impact of these developments in
modern world, it is argued, has led to the decline
of the relevance and influence of religion.
Opposed to the modernisation-secularisation
paradigm is the view that the influence of
religion in the public sphere has not only not
declined, but in fact, has increased. There are
tendencies which suggest that there is a
worldwide resurgence of religion. Such an
impression is based on three factors: missionary
expansion, fundamentalist radicalisation and the
political instrumentalisation of the potential for
violence. Between these 2 possibilities India
started her experiments with Secularism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>A DIFFERENT SECULARISM</i></strong></div>

The public sphere emerged in Europe in the
18th century within the society as a discursive
space in which private individuals came together
to discuss matters of public interest. The
separation of powers of the state and the church
and the enlightenment virtues of reason and
humanism, and the economic changes brought
about by the Industrial Revolution, contributed
to the formation of the public sphere and shaped
the transactions within it. The existence of the
public sphere was contingent upon the access
of all citizens to, and protection of individual
rights by the rule of law. In essence, the character
of the public sphere as it evolved in Europe in
the 18th century was secular and democratic.
The formation and development of the public
sphere in India during the 19th and 20th
centuries had a different trajectory. This was
primarily because India was under colonial
domination and Indian society did not have the
necessary independence to shape its destiny. For
a variety of reasons, the ability of the agencies
which contributed to the formation of the public
sphere in India — such as the media, voluntary
organisations and social and religious movements
— to constitute a public sphere was restricted.
Unlike in Europe the public sphere in India was
not the product of a free society; it took shape
within the political, social and economic
parameters set by the colonial government. Its
social base was very weak, consisting of the
nascent emerging middle class. The legacy of
colonial rule imparted to the public sphere in
independent India an internally contradictory
character. In terms of conception and
constitution the public sphere was democratic
and secular, but it was not so in practice.
In India the public sphere reflected the coexistence of the secular and the religious. The
media were essentially secular, but an
undercurrent of religious consciousness was
reflected. The public sphere has succumbed to
the celebration of religiosity, based on rituals and
superstitions. The official policy of equal
recognition of all religions has only led to the
reinforcement of this contradiction, because it
has opened up more and more public space to
all religions. As a result, what has become
prominent in the public sphere is not secular
reason but religious celebration.

<br>
The State's subsidises the Kumbh Mela.
Muslims wishing to make the Haj pilgrimage
receive state support; Sikhs travelling to
Gurdwaras of historic importance in Pakistan
also get support. The state helps underwrite
dozens of pilgrimages, from Amarnath to
Kailash Mansarovar.
When India became independent in 1947, a
central question the new nation faced was the
relation of faith to state. There was a strong
movement to create India as a ‘Hindu Rashtra’,
a mirror-image of the Islamic nation that was
Pakistan. The person who stood most firmly
against this idea was the first Prime Minister,
Jawaharlal Nehru. In a letter written to Chief
Ministers on October 15, 1947, he reminded
them that “we have a Muslim minority who are
so large in numbers that they cannot, even if they
want to, go anywhere else. They have got to live
in India. This is a basic fact about which there
can be no argument. Whatever the provocation
from Pakistan and whatever the indignities and
horrors inflicted on non-Muslims there, we have
got to deal with this minority in a civilised
manner. We must give them security and the
rights of citizens in a democratic State.”

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Debate on Securalism</i></strong></div>

Both Jinnah and Golwalkar appeared to
believe that a Hindu is a Hindu, and a Muslim a
Muslim, and never the twain shall meet. These
two men claimed that their views and
mentalities, their styles of worship and ways of
living, were so utterly different as to not permit
them to live peacefully together. The two
communities, in other words, were two nations.
This interpretation of Hindu-Muslim relations
was vigorously contested by the Maulana Abul
Kalam Azad. Down the ages, the interaction of
Hindus and Muslims was marked by love and
by hate, by conflict as well as by collaboration.
There were times when Hindus and Muslims
clashed and fought, and other times when they
lived together, harmoniously.
<br>
<br>
Jawaharlal Nehru pointed out in October
1947, ‘we have a Muslim minority who are so
large in numbers that they cannot, even if they
want, go anywhere else. That is a basic fact about
which there can be no argument. Whatever the
provocation from Pakistan and whatever the
indignities and horrors inflicted on non-Muslims
there, we have got to deal with this minority in
a civilized manner. We must give them security
and the rights of citizens in a democratic State.’
Whatever happened—or did not happen—under
the rule of Akbar and Aurangzeb in the past, or
in countries such as Saudi Arabia and Pakistan
in the present, in the Indian Republic every
Indian is guaranteed the same rights.
Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel were not
opponents and adversaries. This myth is
promoted by advocates of a ‘strong’ India, by
those who believe that Nehru was soft on
Pakistan, soft on China, and soft on the
minorities. It is usually accompanied by a
subsidiary myth, namely, that Patel would have
made a ‘better’ Prime Minister than Nehru. In
truth, Nehru and Patel worked superbly as a
team—who, in the first, formative years of
independence, effectively united and strengthened India. Of course, they differed by
temperament and ideology. But these differences
were subsumed and transcended by commitment to a common ideal: namely, a free, united,
secular and democratic India. There were
somethings Nehru could do better than Patel—
communing with the masses, relating to the
world, assuring vulnerable groups (such as
Muslims, Tribals, and Dalits) that they enjoyed
equal rights with other Indians. There were some
things Patel could do better than Nehru—dealing
with the princes, nurturing the Congress party,
carrying along dissidents in the Constituent
Assembly. Each knew the other’s gifts, each took
care not to tresspass on the other person’s turf.
That is how, together, they built India anew out
of the ruins of Partition. Along with the Kashmir
issue, an important sources of consent tension
between the two countries was the strong sense
of insecurity among Hindus in East Bengal,
fuelled primarily by the communal character of
Pakistan’s political system. This led to the steady
migrated of the persecuted Hindus from East
Bengal to West Bengal to retaliatory attacks on
Muslim in West Bengal, leading to their
migration. On 8 April, 1950, the prime ministers
of India and Pakistan signed an agreement
known as the Nehru-Liaqat pact to resolve the
issue of protection of the minorities. The pact met
with the strong disapproval of the Hindu
communalists and the two ministers from
Bengal, Shyama Prasad Mookerjee and K.C.
Neogi, resigned from the cabinet in protest. This
incident clearly demonstrates that communalism
has not only led to internal problems but our
relations with neighboring countries have also
been effected by the scourge of communalism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Some Controversial Incidents</i></strong></div>

Use of religion for political ends has
substantially increased during the last few
decades. Such a development has serious
implications for a secular state and society. An
important feature of Indian politics and
administration in the last few decades has been
the growing laxity of the state apparatuses
especially the police, in their treatment of
communal violence. Communalism is an ideology
based on the belief that Indian society is divided
into religious communities, whose economic,
political, social and cultural interests diverge and
are even hostile to each other because of their
religious differences. Like all ideologies and
politics, communalism has a concrete social base
or roots; it is the product of and reflects the
overall socio-economic and political conditions.
This artificially created base has led to the
growth of communalism since the 1960s in form
of political opportunism towards communalism
practised by political parties, groups and
individuals. The soft approach towards
communal parties and groups has had the
extremely negative consequence of making them
respectable and legitimizing communalism.
Some of these trends are discussed below in
topical framework.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Politics of Ban</i></strong></div>

The debate on multiculturalism and offensive
speech is a burning topic across the world,
affecting everything from politics to literature.
Secularism today has reached a point where it
actually means the state will encourage a cutthroat competition among all shades of religion.
A strong movement of secular, democraticminded people is the need of the hour. The
censoring out of Mr. Rushdie from the Jaipur
literary festival was not an isolated event. India's
constitutionalism is at stake. Every religious
festival is increasingly becoming a statesponsored event. Secular-minded writers and
artists find it difficult to publish their creative
works for fear of being banned by the state and
manhandled by vandals. Instead of making
efforts to make our nation truly progressive, our
elected representatives have failed us and the
Constitution's ideals by bending over backwards
to appease faith-based groups. 'We, the people'
must ensure that the ‘theocratic dystopia' does
not reach the monstrous proportions and forms
it is capable of.
<br>
<br>
By violently protesting, the religious
fundamentalists obviously want to enforce a ban,
otherwise legally unsustainable, on artistic
works. The larger purpose is to criminally
intimidate free-thinking artists who dare to
question the authority of religion and religious
scriptures. Freedom of expression is an inviolable,
fundamental right in India; it cannot be held to
ransom by intolerant, communal, fringe elements
who invoke religious sentiments to get away with
blatantly unconstitutional acts. In secular India,
the right to freedom of religion is on a par with
other fundamental rights. One fundamental
right cannot infringe on another fundamental
right.
<br>
<br>
Examples are Abound
Recent a play in Delhi by acclaimed dramatist
K.S. Rajendran was cancelled. He was invited
to stage a play at an international seminar on
Dara Shikoh – Shah Jahan’s heir apparent who
lost the struggle of succession to his brother
Aurangzeb. The play “Aurangzeb” was written
in 1974 in Tamil by Indira Parthasarathy and it
explores the transformation of Aurangzeb from
a child interested in music and Sufism to
someone perceived as a divisive character in
history. He used the writings of Sir Jadunath
Sarkar, then the Bible on Aurangzeb, for
reference. His play came at a time when many
states, including Tamil Nadu were
uncomfortable with what they saw as an
imposition of Hindi on them by the rulers in
Delhi. The play is a critique on the one nationone language-one faith theory.
For the ardent supporters of secularism,
Salman Rushdie's censoring-out from the literary
festival in Jaipur will be remembered as a
milestone that marked the slow motion
disintegration of India's secular state. Islamist
clerics first pressured the state to stop Mr.
Rushdie from entering India; on realising he
could not stop, he was scared off with a dubious
assassination threat. Fear turned out to be an
effective censor. M. F. Hussain, Taslima Nasreen
are some other well known names that have been
the victim of politics of ban.
India's religious leaders, regardless of their
faith, have long been intensely hostile to state
regulation of religion – witness the country's
failure to rid itself of the faith-based laws that
govern our personal lives. In the matter of the
perpetuation of their religion, though, the state
is a welcome ally.
<br>
<br>
By citing law and order as the reason for the
Viswaroopam ban, the Tamil Nadu government
also contributed to the banning culture. All
governments speak of their apprehension of law
and order disturbances while appearing to
appease religious fundamentalists and
extremists by enforcing bans on films and other
art forms. E.g. the 'Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam
(DMK) government, while banning The Da Vinci
Code' in 2006, stated that the release of the film
might “lead to demonstrations and disrupt peace
and tranquillity” in the State. The stonethrowing and arson in Karnataka by fanatics
against the publication in a Kannada daily of
an article, purportedly by Taslima Nasreen, on
wearing of the burka were a nasty challenge to
the freedom of expression guaranteed in the
Indian Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Way Forward</i></strong></div>

"Though nobody can deny that religion
survives on faith and no one has the right hurt
it. But at the same time there must be a balance
between the competing rights i.e. rights to
freedom of expression and freedom of religion.
India must get rid of the exclusiveness in thought
and social habit which has made life a prison to
her, stunting her spirit and preventing growth”
wrote Jawaharlal Nehru in 'The Discovery of
India'. It took 350 years for the Church to admit
that Galileo Galilei was right. Maybe, it will take
longer in India but we need to keep working in
that direction.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Babri Masjid Demolition</i></strong></div>

A mosque was built by a governor of Babur
at Ayodhya (in Uttar Pradesh) in the early
sixteenth century. Some Hindus claimed in the
nineteenth century that it was built over a site
which was the place where Ram was born and
where a Ram temple had existed. Issue came to
forefront in December 1949 when a district
magistrate permitted a few Hindus to enter the
mosque and instal idols of Sita and Ram there.
Sardar Patel, as the Home Minister, and
Jawaharlal Nehru condemmed the district
magistrate's action, but the Uttar Pradesh
Government felt that it could not reverse the
decision. However, it locked the mosque. The
situation was more or less accepted by all as a
temporary solution for the period of the dispute
in the court.
<br>
<br>
In 1983, VHP started a public campaign
demanding the 'liberation' of the Ram
Janmabhoomi, which would entail the
demolition of the mosque and the erection of a
Ram temple in its place. Many political parties
and groups did not do anything to counter the
campaign; they just ignored it. On 1 February,
1986, the district judge reopened the mosque,
gave Hindu priests its possession, and permitted
Hindus to worship there. The Hindu communalists demanded the demolition of the mosque
and the construction of a Ram temple on its site.
In 1989, the VHP, keeping in view the
impending Lok Sabha elections, organized a
massive movement to start the construction of a
Ram temple at the site where the Babri mosque
stood. As a part of that objective, it gave a call
for the collection of bricks, sanctified by water
from the river Ganges, from all over the country
to be taken to Ayodhya.
<br>
<br>
To popularize the objective, it organized in
1990 an All-India Rath Yatra headed by its
president, L.K. Advani. The yatra aroused fierce
communal passions and was followed by
communal riots in large number of places.
Thousands of BJP-VHP volunteers gathered at
Ayodhya at the end of October 1990, despite the
Uttar Pradesh government, headed by Mulayam
Singh Yadav, banning the rally. To disperse the
volunteers and to prevent them from harming
the mosque, the police opened fire on them,
killing and injuring over a hundred persons. The
BJP-VHP organized a huge rally of over 200,000
volunteers at the site of the mosque on 6
December, 1992, with the major leaders of the
two organizations being present.
To allay the fears of injury to the mosque,
Kalyan Singh BJP Chief Minister of UP, gave an
assurance to the Supreme Court that the mosque
would be protected. In spite of the assurance,
the volunteers set out to demolish the mosque
with hammer blows, while government looked
on. The entire country was shocked. Communal
riots broke out in many parts of the country, the
worst hit being Bombay, Calcutta and Bhopal.
The riots in Bombay lasted for nearly a month.
In all more than 3,000 people were killed in the
riots all over India.
Recently, judicial decisions in Ayodhya case
was handed down by the Lucknow Bench of the
Allahabad High Court when it passed judgment
on the title suits regarding ownership of the
disputed land on which once stood the Babri
Masjid.
<br>
<br>
What does it mean, for example, that
questions of theology should have to be resolved
by a court of law? Courts in other democracies
are not generally called upon to adjudicate such
questions as were brought before the three
judges. Has it become something of a habit in
India to turn to our courts for matters that cannot
by a sensible person be viewed as falling under
the purview of jurisprudence or legal reasoning?
What does it say about civil society in India that
a court should have been asked to adjudicate
whether the ‘disputed site’ was the birthplace
of Rama, and what can a court tell us on this
matter that might not have been told to us by
historians, archaeologists, or other scholars? Do
we not have enough resources among us as a
people to be able to come to some common
understanding on these matters?
Babri Masjid was most likely built with the
remnants of a Hindu temple. Many temples were
built and destroyed, not always or even often at
the hands of the Muslim conqueror; some fell to
the elements, others were vandalized, and yet
others bore the brunt of battle, sometimes
between Indian rulers. The architects and
masons picked up pieces of temple sculpture and
wove them into the architecture of the new
mosque and vice versa. It is instructive that not
only Muslims but Hindus and Jains in India, and
Christians elsewhere in the world, did exactly
the same, utilizing the remains of previous
religious structures to build new ones. Much of
history, one might go so far as to say, is nothing
but spoliation – we plunder and rob not only
religious structures but the past, sometimes as
the only way of making the past alive,
coterminus with the present.
<br>
<br>
A lot has been said about the lack of
enthusiasm for the verdict among the general
public. This is because the aam aadmi has
become mature enough to realise that the actual
beneficiaries of the Ayodhya dispute and the like
are politicians and religious leaders. Or aam
aadmi is still the communal Hindu or communal
Muslim? Is the main question that will decide
the future of secularism in India. Since the
Ayodhya issue is a matter of faith, it is not so
easy to resolve through court interventions. India
as a nation-in-making has been unable to evolve
a consensus on it. It is ingrained in the minds of
Indians and will remain thus as long as religion
remains the centre of politics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mumbai Riots and 1993 Blasts</i></strong></div>

It is 20 years since two cataclysmic events
shook Bombay now Mumbai. First, – the
communal carnage spread over two months.
Second, the serial blasts of March 12, 1993, with
which terror came home to the city and claiming
innocent lives. The Srikrishna Commission, in its
final report, said the riots appeared to have been
a causative factor for the bomb blasts. Supreme
Court has finally disposed of appeals by death
row convicts and actor Sanjay Dutt in the March
12, 1993 serial blasts case on March 21, 2013.
Godhra Train burning and Gujarat Riots
The story began on the morning of 27
February at Godhra, town in Gujarat, where a
bogey of the Sabarmati Express caught fire. 58
people, including 15 women and 20 children,
were burnt to death in the fire. The victims were
all Hindus, Karsevaks or volunteers, returning
from participating in a yagya or religious
ceremony at Ayodhya.
<br>
<br>
On 28 February began a wave of communal
riots that continued for almost three months. The
police and administration allegedly looked the
other way or even connived and helped. Many
observers have remarked that what distinguished
the events of 2002 was that, unlike a typical riot
situation in which two groups engage in, usually
spontaneous, violence, the assault was onesided, premeditated, brutal, and supported or
facilitated by the state. The Gujarat events shook
the conscience of the nation. Many high profile
cases are being fought in courts and it is believed
by many that judiciary alongwith certain well
known faces are fighting the seemingly eternal
fight against the biggest enemy of State i.e.
Communalism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>'Sons of the Soil' Movements</i></strong></div>

Since the 1950s an ugly kind of regionalism
has been widely prevalent in the form of the 'sons
of the soil' doctrine. It is based on the view that
a state specifically belongs to the main liquistic
group inhabiting it or that the state constitutes
the exclusive, 'homeland' of its main language
speakers who are the 'sons of the soil' or the 'local'
residents. All others who live there or are settled
there and whose mother tongue is different are
'outsiders'. Language loyalty and regionalism
was used to systematically exclude the 'outsiders'
from the economic life of a state or city.
<br>
<br>
The 'sons of the soil' movements have arisen,
when there is actual or potential competition for
industrial and middle-class jobs, between the
migrants and the local middle-class youth.
Economic mobility of population through
migration of unskilled labour from the bakward
regions and of skilled labour to them can
contribute to the lessening of regional disparity;
and the Indian constitution guarantees this
mobility. There has been a great deal of
migration from one state to another. Some states
Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Bihar and Kerala—
have benefited from out-migration just as Bengal,
Gujarat and Maharashtra have benefited fom inmigration. But economic rationale hardly stays
in front of passion.
<br>
<br>
Most popular movement in public memory
was led by the Shiv Sena, off late by MNS also
which split from Shiv Sena. This appealed to
extreme regional chauvinism and assumed facial
proportions. This was funded in 1966, under the
leadership of Bal Thackeray. The Shiv Sena
demanded that preference in jobs should be
given to Maharashtrians, who were defined as
those whose mother tongue was Marathi. Raising
the slogan of 'Maharashtra for the Maharashtrians', the Shiv Sena organized a militant, and
often violent movement against South Indians,
especially Tamils. Later north Indian came in the
line of fire. The 'sons of the soil' movements in
Assam and Telegana have also assumed serious
proportions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CASTE POLITICS</i></strong></div>

The farmers’ movements, dalit mobilisation,
the renewed struggles of the agrarian poor,
women’s discourse, and the new phase of
student politics and civil rights articulation in a
number of States, are all demonstrative of the
vibrant politics of post-Emergency India. During
the recent years, caste mobilisation has become
an important factor in shaping Indian politics.
Ever since the issue of Mandal Commission
reservations in government jobs for the OBCs
came to the national agenda in 1989, it has left
an impact on the evolution of national politics.
The practice of reservation has also shown that
it is almost impossible to reverse. The constitution
had envisaged reserations as a short-term
measure lasting ten years; but it is now nearly
66 years. At the same time demands for and
acceptance of reservation have only increased.
Dinesh Goswami burnt himself to death to
protest the implementation of Mandal
Commission, but once out of pandora’s box,
genie of OBC reservation could not be negated.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Caste in Modern India</i></strong></div>

The word caste derives from the Portuguese
casta , meaning breed, race, or kind. Among the
Indian terms that are sometimes translated as
caste are varna, jati, jat, biradri, and samaj.
Many castes are traditionally associated with an
occupation. There is also some correlation
between ritual rank on the caste hierarchy and
economic prosperity. Inequalities among castes
are considered by the Hindu faithful to be part
of the divinely ordained natural order and are
expressed in terms of purity and pollution.
The caste stratification of our society is
something that has come down to us from
centuries. Despite all the refinements and
changes within castes and between castes, that
have taken place over the years, the basic
structure, in so far as the oppression of the dalits
or the backward castes is concerned remains.
The main reason for this persistence of social
oppression based on caste stratification is the
inadequacy of the ruling classes, during the
freedom struggle, in addressing themselves to
this issue. The overcoming of caste differentiation
was sought through proper social behaviour
between individuals and castes without growing
into the social roots of this phenomenon.
Ideologically Jyotiba's movement was an
uncompromising attack on the ancient and
feudal superstructure. However, this uncompromising attack did not go beyond to attack the
basic agrarian relations based on feudal land
relations which was the basis on which this
superstructure existed. Similar has been the
experience of Ambedkar. This most outstanding
and tireless fighter, who on behalf of the dalits
exposed the upper caste hypocrisies, lambasted
the then Congress and its policies had to finally
asked his followers to embrace Buddhism to
escape the injustices of Hindu society.
Similar also has been the experience of the
Dravidian movement led by Periyar
E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker. Periyar did succeed
in creating a great feeling against caste
oppression and his voice boomed large against
untouchability. But yet again, viewing this
merely at the level of superstructure without
attacking the socio-economic base that sustains
caste stratification.
<br>
<br>
Universal adult franchise opened up new
possibilities for mobilising electoral support on
the basis of caste and thus prevented the
consciousness of caste from dying down.
Democracy was expected to efface the
distinctions of caste, but its consequences have
been very different from what was expected.
Politics is no doubt an important part of a nation's
life in a democracy, but it is not the only part of
it. There are other areas of life in which the
consciousness of caste has been dying down,
though not very rapidly or dramatically.
The consciousness of caste is brought to the
fore at the time of elections. The mobilisation of
electoral support on the basis of caste is a
complex phenomenon whose outcome gives
scope for endless speculation. Private television
channels have created a whole world in which
their anchors and the experts who are regularly
at their disposal vie with each other to bring out
the significance of the “caste factor,” meaning
the rivalries and alliances among castes, subcastes and groups of castes.
The system of parliamentary democracy that
was adopted was based on an electoral system
which tended to reinforce the caste
consciousness. Instead of guaranteeing equality,
irrespective of caste, the electoral system, itself,
nurtured the perpetuation of caste consciousness
in terms of choice of candidates and the appeal
to the electorate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Politics of Caste and Reservation</i></strong></div>

Govt. has come in favour of enumeration of
castes in special census. The ostensible need to
include enumeration of the backward castes
(BCs) flows from the Mandal Commission
recommendations, which mandated monitoring
of their progress after 20 years from their
implementation. Before the 2001 Census began,
there was a demand made for such inclusion in
the census. But this proposal was turned down
by the Ministry of Home Affairs, which controls
the census organisation. This time although the
government created turbulence around the issue
by referring it to the GoM, which accepted it.
The core rationale for this caste census may
thus lie in the technical requirement arising from
the acceptance of the Mandal Commission
recommendations to extend reservations to the
OBCs. Mandal recommendations and
particularly their acceptance by the V.P. Singh
government in 1989 will be an ominous mark
on the path of annihilation of castes. It gave a
new lease of life to castes. The entire caste game
was played in the name of the Constitution,
which rather had reference to class and
individuals. The Constitution under Articles 15
(4), 16(4), 46 and 340 refers to “socially and
educationally backward classes” or “backward
class citizens”. In the country in which peoples’
politics is stuck on the unfortunate duality of
caste and class, the State as well as the judiciary
interpreted class in the Constitution to be
synonymous with “caste”.
<br>
<br>
The intention of the recent high court order
to stay caste-based rallies might have been to
check politics on caste and communal lines but
the political parties in the state will find ways to
bypass it for caste based politics. It is extremely
difficult to find the most acceptable stand on the
issue of caste, when passions run high on both
sides of issue. But one thing is sure that caste
politics will remain a part of Indian political
landscape for a long time to come.
<br>
<br>
Dalit Political Uprising
Kanshi Ram (March 15th, 1934 to October
8th, 2006) is lovingly referred and remembered
as ‘Saheb’ (in Maharashtra) or ‘Sahab’ (in North
India) or as ‘Manyavar’ among his followers. He
remained most enigmatic personality throughout
1980s and 90s who played the most significant
role in Indian politics after Independence. It is
believed by many that he proved that politics of
socially marginalized and poor people can also
succeed without the help of literate, intellectuals,
business houses and urban gentry. He singlehandedly changed the mainstream politics of the
most populated State Uttar Pradesh and thereby,
the Indian polity itself.
<br>
<br>
Kanshi Ram believed in democratic values
and constitutional provisions. He was convinced
of power of political elections and voting rights
which have been enshrined in the constitution
to all. He believed that right of votes is a valuable
equalizer; with ‘one man-one vote and one voteone value’. However this can help only when
‘you learn to use it meticulously’. His following
slogans prove his deep faith in the Indian
democracy. “Vote Humara Raj Tumhara Nahi
Chalega – Nahi chalega”; (Our Vote and Your
Rule, No Longer, No Longer) “Vote Se Lenge PM
CM- Arakshan Se Lenge SP–DM” (form votes
we will have Prime Minister and Chief Minister
and from reservations Superintendent of Police
and District Magistrate); ‘Jiski Jitni Sankhya
Bhari Uski Utni Bhagedari’ (each community
should get according to the percentage of its
population).
<br>
<br>
Kanshi Ram’s movement was dynamic in
nature. He perpetually experimented by
mobilizing people and envisaging a larger goal
for his movement by incorporating more and
more people in it. He politically socialized them
by forming different types of organizations, in
his cadre camps which used to run for days and
by organizing political programmes which used
to run for months. From the life and struggle one
can definitely establish that Manyavar was the
true inheritor of Babasaheb’s legacy; however
Manyavar himself always argued that he is only
giving a “practical shape to Baba Saheb’s
theoretical formulation and in turn trying to fulfil
the unfinished movement of Baba Saheb”.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NAME CHANGE POLITICS</i></strong></div>

The process of renaming of cities in India
started after the end of the British imperial period
in 1947 and continues to date. Ever since the
British left India in 1947, many cities, streets,
places, and buildings throughout India were
assigned new "Indian names". India wanted to
change the names kept by the British colonialists,
& rename them according to their "Sanskritized
Hindi roots" or something along those lines.
Certain old names, however, continue to be
popular. The states whose names have been
changed are: Travancore- Cochin to Kerala,
Madhya Bharat to Madhya Pradesh, Madras
State to Tamil Nadu, Mysore to Karnataka and
Uttaranchal to Uttarakhand. The renamed
Indian union territories are Laccadive, Minicoy
and Amindivi Islands to Lakshadweep and
Pondicherry to Puducherry.
<br>
<br>
Trend is not limited to India alone. Cities have
been renamed to assert local pronunciation over
foreign in many countries also. The decision to
rename is said to be part of a wider trend to erase
the Anglican influence in the naming of states
and cities amid demands for carrying out more
name changes elsewhere in the country. The
reasons that have been cited for renaming cities
include: to adjust the spelling in English language
to the spelling in the local language. (Simla to
Shimla) and to switch back to the local name
from an English name derived from the original.
A change in the name of a state however requires
approval of Union Cabinet and Parliament
under Articles 3 and 4 of the Constitution, and
the President has to refer the same to the relevant
state legislature for its views.
There have been political controversies about
several renaming. Not all proposed renaming
were actually implemented. Every renaming of
a city in India has to be approved by the central
government. The trend of renaming of a state
gained momentum after renaming of Bombay,
Madras and Calcutta. Bombay was renamed
Mumbai--derived from name of Goddess
Mumbadevi--in 1995 when the Shiv Sena-BJP
combine won the Maharashtra Assembly
elections. In the following year Madras was
renamed to Chennai and in 2001 Calcutta was
renamed Kolkata. While Calcutta became
Kolkata, West Bengal never got a name change.
Alphabetically, West Bengal which is the last in
the order of states in the country also hopes to
move up in the list with desired name change to
Paschimbanga.
<br>
<br>
The country's Information Technology (IT)
capital Bangalore was renamed Bengaluru in
2007 but the younger generation in the Silicon
city did not sound too enthusiastic about the
name change. It was felt that the image of the
city may take a beating worldwide as the name
does not sound too appealing or 'modern'.
Bangalore was originally known as Benda
Kaluru and then became Bengaluru following
which the British renamed it as Bangalore. The
name change of Orissa to Odisha is another
recent change.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NAXALISM</i></strong></div>

In 1969, the Communist Party MarxistLeninist (ML) was formed under the leadership
of Charu Majumdar. Similar parties and groups
were formed in Andhra, Orissa, Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, Punjab and Kerala. The CP(ML) and
other Naxalite groups argued that democracy
in India was a sham, the Indian state was fascist
and feudal. India was politically and
economically dominated by US, British and
Soviet imperialisms, Indian polity and economy
were still colonial, the Indian revolution was still
incomplete, and protracted guerrilla warfare
was the form revolution would take in India. The
Naxalite groups got political and ideological
support from the Chinese government.
In Naxalbari village of West Bengal, CPI(ML)
and other Naxalite groups succeeded in
organizing armed peasant bands in some rural
areas and in attacking policemen and rival
communists as agents of the ruling classes. The
government, however, succeeded in suppressing
them and limiting their influence to a few pockets
in the country. Not able to face state repression,
the Naxalites soon split into several groups. But
the real reason for their failure lay in their
inability to root their radicalism in Indian reality,
to grasp the character of Indian society and
polity.
<br>
<br>
The major Naxal group in India has been CPI,
MCC, CPI(M-L) Liberation, CPI(M-L) Unity
organization and Peoples war group. In 2004
PWG and MCC joined together to form
Communist Party of India which is at present
main organization of all Naxalites in India. It
should be noted that all Naxal groups are
originated from CPI(M-L) formed in 1969 by
Charu Mazumdar and others. Beside violent
struggle, the major characteristics of Naxal
movement in India have been various splits,
disintegration and reorganization and
ideological backing. Many of the groups and
leaders have accepted parliamentary path to
social change, yet other continues to uphold
revolutionary ideology.
<br>
<br>
The Naxalites are wedded to the cult of the
gun. Their worship of violence is extreme. They
are a grave threat to democracy and democratic
values. A democratically elected State Government should tackled their challenge through a
two-pronged strategy: (i) smart police work,
identifying the areas where the Naxalites arw
active and isolating their leaders; (ii) sincerely
implementing the constitutional provisions
guaranteeing the land and tribal forest rights of
the adivasis, and improving the delivery of health
and education services to them. According to the
Home ministry of India at present there are 220
districts in 20 states are affected by naxal violence
and force alone can not solve the issue. What is
needed is a two-pronged strategy as mentioned
above.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AFSPA</i></strong></div>

AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Power Act)
is a bare law with just six sections. The most
controversial are those in the fourth and sixth
sections: the former enables security forces to
“fire upon or otherwise use force, even to the
causing of death” where laws are being violated.
The latter says no criminal prosecution will lie
against any person who has taken action under
this act. In 54 years, not a single army, or
paramilitary officer or soldier has been
prosecuted for murder, rape, destruction of
property (including the burning of villages in the
1960s in Nagaland and Mizoram).
Some time ago, two judges of the Supreme
Court, intervening in a case where the Central
Bureau of Investigation was seeking to prosecute
army officers accused of murdering five villagers
in Jammu & Kashmir, in what is known as the
Pathribal incident, declared clearly that AFSPA’s
protection was limited to acts conducted in the
line of duty. Army circles are worried that
soldiers and officers will be dragged to civilian
courts and that frivolous cases will be filed
against them. This is a real matter of concern
but it cannot be the rationale for blocking efforts
to repeal or amend AFSPA.
<br>
<br>
We need to remember two points here about
AFSPA and the place where it all began —
<br>
Nagaland, in 1958. Nagaland today is peaceful.
It is not free of intimidation, extortion or factional
killings, but not a single Indian solider has fallen
in combat here for the past five years. The State
government has been asking, since 2005, for the
removal of the Disturbed Areas Act but with no
results. In 2005, The Reddy Committee gave its
report, which not only recommended AFSPA’s
repeal but also proposed a legal mechanism by
which the Army could be used in extraordinary
situations involving national security
This act and numerous other that have been
reportedly misused by the security forces show
the important role played by the legislative bodies
in facing the menace of terrorism and insurgency.
A too lax law and a too rigid law-both can be
counterproductive.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>UNIFORM CIVIL CODE & NATIONAL
INTEGRATION</i></strong></div>

Article 44 of the Constitution of India reads:
‘The State shall endeavour to secure for the
citizens a uniform civil code throughout the
territory of India’. The objective of this article is
to effect an integration of India by bringing all
communities into a common platform which is
at present governed by personal laws which do
not form the essence of any religion. At the same
time, Article 37 of the Constitution makes it very
clear that the provisions contained in the
Directive Principles of State Policy are not
enforceable by any court of law and therefore,
the courts have no jurisdiction over them.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>History behind UCC</i></strong></div>

The first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal
Nehru, and the first Law Minister, Dr. B.R.
Ambedkar, were both modernists who wished
to reform archaic personal laws and bring them
in line with progressive notions of gender justice.
They were both committed, in theory, to a
Uniform Civil Code. However, faced with the
bitter opposition of Muslim members in the
Constituent Assembly, they decided to begin
with the reform of the personal laws of the
Hindus, a community whose liberal wing was
both influential and articulate. All the same, it
took them all of eight years to pass the laws that
finally made caste irrelevant in marriage,
allowed Hindu women the right to choose or
divorce their marriage partners, abolished
bigamy and polygamy among Hindus, and
granted Hindu daughters and wives rights in the
property of their fathers and husbands. The
opposition to the reform of the Hindu personal
laws was led by the Jana Sangh and the
Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh. The laws being
drafted to allow personal choice in marriage and
inheritance rights to daughters were denounced
as intrusion in Hindu society. On the other side,
the Socialists and Communists chastised the
Government for not reforming the personal laws
of all communities.
<br>
<br>
UCC generally refers to that part of law
which deals with family affairs of an individual
and denotes uniform law for all citizens,
irrespective of his/her religion, caste or tribe.
Laws relating to crime and punishment are
uniform for all citizens. So are the laws relating
to commerce, contracts and other economic
affairs. However, family affairs such as
marriage, divorce, inheritance, guardianship and
adoption are legally permitted to be governed
by customs or rules applicable to the persons and
their community. This has been the practise from
the time of British rule (even before that), because
it was considered prudent not to disturb the
people’s religious and community customs as far
as their private affairs are concerned. The same
position continued even after the independence
and people were permitted to follow their
respective personal laws.
<br>
<br>
Over the period, there have been attempts
to codify personal laws applicable to each
religious group. The codified personal laws
relating to marriage, divorce and inheritance are
mainly: The Indian Christian Marriage Act of
1872 (applicable to whole of India except areas
of erstwhile Travancore-Cochin, Manipur and
Jammu & Kashmir); Anand Marriage Act, 1909
(For Sikh marriages); Cochin Christian Civil
Marriage Act of 1920 (applicable for TravancoreCochin areas); Muslim Personal Law (Shariat)
Application Act, 1937 (making Shariat laws
applicable to Indian Muslims); The Parsi
Marriage and Divorce Act, 1937; Hindu
Marriage Act, 1955 (applicable to not merely
Hindus, Buddhists and Jains but also to any
person who is not a Muslim, Christian, Parsi or
Jew, and who is not governed by any other law).
While Indian Parliament has enacted a secular
law for marriages (The Special Marriage Act,
1954) that provides a system of marriage
irrespective of the religion or faith followed by
either party to the marriage, the number of
marriages that occurs under this system is still
negligible.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Shah Bano Case</i></strong></div>

Shah Bano case was a milestone in the
Muslim women's search for justice and the
beginning of the political battle over personal
law. A 60-year-old woman went to court asking
maintenance from her husband who had
divorced her. The court ruled in her favour. Shah
Bano was entitled to maintenance from her exhusband under Section 125 of the Criminal
Procedure Code like any other Indian woman.
The judgment was not the first granting a
divorced Muslim woman maintenance under
Section 125. But a voluble orthodoxy deemed the
verdict an attack on Islam.
The Congress Government under the
pressure of the orthodoxy enacted the Muslim
Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act,
1986. The most controversial provision of the Act
was that it gave a Muslim woman the right to
maintenance for the period of 'iddat' (about three
months) after the divorce, and shifted the onus
of maintaining her to her relatives or the Wakf
Board. The Act was seen as discriminatory as it
denied divorced Muslim women the right to
basic maintenance which women of other faiths
had recourse to under secular law.
<br>
<br>
The Bharatiya Janata Party saw it as
'appeasement' of the minority community and
discriminatory. The Shah Bano judgement was
a landmark in our social and political history for
a large number of reasons. This case was
different because Shah Bano's former husband
was a lawyer and could appeal to the Supreme
Court against the judgements given in her favour
by the lower courts. Chief Justice Y.V.
Chandrachud delivered a verdict in Shah Bano's
favour with certain observations that attracted
wrath of hardliners. This elicited a protest from
many sections of Muslims who also took to the
streets against what they saw, and what they
were led to believe, was an attack on their
religion and their right to their own religious
personal laws.
<br>
<br>
In 1984, Rajiv Gandhi led his party to victory
but soon found his government faltering when
his finance minister, V.P. Singh, levelled serious
charges of corruption against the Congress.
Faced with a situation in which a huge number
of Muslims were protesting on the streets
Government did not enact a law in Parliament
overturning the Supreme Court judgement. Rajiv
Gandhi took two political decisions which would
have momentous and disastrous results: he
pushed through an Act of Parliament which
denied Muslim women the right to demand
maintenance from their former husbands and
gave the green signal to the Uttar Pradesh
Government to unlock the gates to the makeshift
Ram Mandir set up surreptitiously inside the
Babri Masjid. Then, the premises were locked by
the court while the case was sub judice. Many
political commentators have argued that this
attempt to appease the fundamentalists of both
communities gave the BJP an issue that ensured
its future electoral successes; and an immediate
electoral victory to the Janata Dal which
benefited from Muslim anger being converted
into votes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Road ahead</i></strong></div>

The bogey that a uniform civil code
necessarily entails the repeal of personal laws
needs to be laid to rest. This is simply not so. In
most probable case, if enacted, a uniform civil
code will be one among many and, like 'The
Special Marriage Act, an option. This is
guaranteed by the constitutional provisions
pertaining to the right to freedom of religion.
While religious ideologues have been responsible
for derailing a rational debate on a uniform code,
secularists have done the nation grave disservice
by opposing movement towards a uniform code
or reform of personal law. A touch-me-not
secularism has resulted installing the process of
modernisation and social reform.
A uniform code has been wrongly posited
as an assault on religion and religious identities.
What it essentially aims at is secular reform of
property relations in respect of which all religious
traditions have grossly discriminated against
women. A uniform civil code is, therefore,
foremost a matter of gender justice. But male
chauvinism and greed have joined with religious
conservatism to forge an unholy alliance to
perpetuate a major source of gender
discrimination thereby impeding the
modernisation of social relations and national
integration.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Personal Laws and Status of Women</i></strong></div>

The most significant manner in which
personal laws in civil matters affect the rights
discourse is by delineating rights for women
belonging to their respective religious
communities. The ‘family’ remains one of the
most contested sites of women’s rights. One of
biggest criticism working against personal laws
is that these antiquated provisions are
discriminatory towards women and seek to
undermine their position within the private
domain. There is a compelling need to study the
personal religious laws from a human rights
perspective. India has time and again pledged
its commitment to upholding the normative
regime of human rights, be it in the provisions
of the Constitution or the terms of the various
international covenants and treaties.
Principles of equality, non-discrimination
and fairness which form an essential part of the
human rights discourse are the subject matter
of the debate regarding personal laws of India.
These principles are enshrined in the Preamble
to the Constitution, Fundamental Right and the
Directive Principles. Gender equality is a facet
of equality and it is one of the basic principles of
the Constitution. Moreover, the doctrine of
equality as enshrined in Article 14 of the
Constitution of India is not merely formal
equality before the law but embodies the concept
of real and substantive equality which strikes at
all the inequalities arising on account of vast
historical, socio-economic an customary
differentiation. Thus, we see that Article 15(3)
of the Constitution empowers the State to make
special provisions for protection of women and
children. Article 25(2) mandate that social reform
and welfare can be provided irrespective of the
right to freedom of religion. Article 44 which
directs the state to secure for its citizens a
Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of
India is the cornerstone for women’s equality in
the country and must be urgently implemented
so as to eliminate antiquated discriminatory
norms of religious laws.
<br>
<br>
A major feminist critique of the current
human rights discourse is that antidiscrimination measures cannot concern
themselves only with conduct of public officials,
that is to say, with relations between individuals
and government. Discrimination in the ‘private’
sphere of home, workplace and school must also
be addressed, given the power vested in the
institutions of family and the community to
arbiter the women’s rights and freedoms.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Solution</i></strong></div>

The demand for UCC gathered pace after
the Shah Bano controversy. The reform of family
law has become deeply politicized, subject to the
pressures of party politics rather than governed
by the principles of gender justice or the ideals
of the Indian Constitution. But, as Shabana Azmi
has pointed out, ‘for far too long women have
been victimized and justice has been denied to
them under the pretence of personal law’. This
is true of formal Muslim law but also of
customary Hindu law, as in the still powerful
caste councils that ostracize women who dare
marry outside their community. There is thus ‘an
urgent need to cull out the just and equitable
laws of all religions and form a blueprint for a
uniform civil code based on gender justice’.
There is a larger reason for a uniform code.
With the slow but steady empowerment,
modernisation and even globalisation of Indian
society, the country's real diversity is becoming
manifest. Today, with growing education,
migration and economic and social mobility,
unknown and earlier socially prohibited
relationships (for example, inter-caste, interregional, inter-community marriages and
divorce and the acquisition and disposal of selfacquired property by women) are becoming
increasingly common. In the circumstances,
there could be social breakdown, heartburn and
strife even among couples of the same
community without a uniform civil code.
Traditional personal codes do not accommodate
emerging multicultural realities and aspirations.
On the other hand, suppressing them could
engender violence or deviant behaviour,
undermining public order. 'The Special Marriage
Act' fortunately provides a safety valve. But it is
absurd and regressive that Muslim and Christian
Indians cannot legally adopt a child for lack of a
uniform code on adoption.
<br>
<br>
The country needs a twin strategy. An
optional uniform civil law should be promoted
by the state. Clerics, among others, should be
heard but must not prevail on issues of secular
life that are beyond their province. This is
essential if we are to invest new meaning in
India's secular ideal and rescue Muslims from
malicious accusations of hindering national
integration. At the same time, all religious
communities must be encouraged to debate and
support codification and reform of personal
laws. If, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan and Indonesia
have reformed Muslim personal law, there is no
reason why Muslim Indians should not follow
suit.
<br>
<br>
A uniform civil code will focus on rights,
leaving the rituals embodied in personal law
intact within the bounds of constitutional
propriety. Being optional, it will provide free
choice and facilitate harmonisation of social
relationships across the country in keeping with
the changing contours of emerging societal
realities. A uniform civil code should not be
constructed, as sometimes suggested, by putting
together the best elements from various existing
personal codes. This will invite contention. It is
far better that a uniform code is framed de novo
by somebody like the Law Commission, in
consultation with relevant experts and interests,
as a citizens' charter governing family relations.
A liberal, forward-looking uniform civil code
may be expected to win many adherents,
especially from those with cross-cultural
backgrounds. This could in time induce
custodians of faith to look inwards and seek to
codify and reform age-old personal laws in
conformity with current modernising and
integrative tendencies or risk losing their flock.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC CONSOLIDATION AND
REORGANIZATION</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Evolution of Economy</i></strong></div>

In 1947, the country was poor and shattered
by the violence and economic and physical
disruption involved in the partition. The
economy had stagnated since the late nineteenth
century, and industrial development had been
restrained to preserve the area as a market for
British manufacturers. At independence the
economy was predominantly agrarian.
Moreover, the structural economic problems
inherited at independence were exacerbated by
the costs associated with the partition of British
India. The settlement of refugees was a
considerable financial strain. Partition also
divided complementary economic zones. Under
the British, jute and cotton were grown in the
eastern part of Bengal, the area that became East
Pakistan (after 1971, Bangladesh), but processing
took place mostly in the western part of Bengal,
which became the Indian state of West Bengal
in 1947. As a result, after independence India
had to employ land previously used for food
production to cultivate cotton and jute for its
mills.
<br>
<br>
At Independence, the national consensus
was in favour of rapid industrialization of the
economy which was seen not only as the key to
economic development but also to economic
sovereignty. In the subsequent years, India's
Industrial Policy evolved through successive
Industrial Policy Resolutions and Industrial
Policy Statements. Specific priorities for
industrial development were also laid down in
the successive Five Year Plans. After gaining
independence it was necessary to give new
policy for industrial development, decide priority
areas and clear doubts in the minds of private
entrepreneurs regarding nationalisation of
existing industries.
<br>
<br>
So, First Industrial Policy Resolution
announced in 1948 laid down broad contours
of the strategy of industrial development. At that
time the Constitution of India had not taken final
shape nor was the Planning Commission
constituted. Moreover, the necessary legal
framework was also not put in place. Therefore,
the Resolution was somewhat broad in its scope
and direction. Yet, an important distinction was
made among industries to be kept under the
exclusive ownership of Government, i.e., the
public sector, those reserved for private sector
and the joint sector. Bombay Plan prepared
earlier, by leading Indian industrialists in 1944-
45 had recommended government support for
industrialization, including a direct role in the
production of capital goods.
Subsequently, the Indian Constitution was
adopted in January 1950, the Planning
Commission was constituted in March 1950 and
the Industrial (Department and Regulation) Act
(IDR Act) was enacted in 1951 with the objective
of empowering the Government to take
necessary steps to regulate the pattern of
industrial development through licensing. This
paved the way for the Industrial Policy
Resolution of 1956, which was the first
comprehensive statement on the strategy for
industrial development in India. Indian leaders
introduced the five-year plans and agreed that
strong economic growth and measures to
increase incomes and consumption among the
poorest groups were necessary goals for the new
nation. Government was assigned an important
role in this process, and since 1951 a series of
plans have guided the country's economic
development. Although there was considerable
growth in the 1950s, the long-term rates of
growth were less than India's politicians desired
and less than those of many other Asian
countries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industrial Policy Resolution-1956</i></strong></div>

The Industrial Policy Resolution - 1956 was
shaped by the Mahalanobis Model of growth,
which suggested that emphasis on heavy
industries would lead the economy towards a
long term higher growth path. The Resolution
widened the scope of the public sector. The
objective was to accelerate economic growth and
boost the process of industrialization as a means
to achieving a socialistic pattern of society. Given
the scarce capital and inadequate entrepreneurial
base, the Resolution accorded a predominant role
to the State to assume direct responsibility for
industrial development. All industries of basic
and strategic importance and those in the nature
of public utility services besides those requiring
large scale investment were reserved for the
public sector.
<br>
<br>
The Resolution classified industries into three
categories. The first category comprised 17
industries exclusively under the domain of the
Government. These included inter alia, railways,
air transport, arms and ammunition, iron and
steel and atomic energy. The second category
comprised 12 industries, which were envisaged
to be progressively State owned but private sector
was expected to supplement the efforts of the
State. The third category contained all the
remaining industries and it was expected that
private sector would initiate development of
these industries but they would remain open for
the State as well. Despite the demarcation of
industries into separate categories, the Resolution
was flexible enough to allow the required
adjustments and modifications in the national
interest.
<br>
<br>
Another objective spelt out in the Industrial
Policy Resolution-1956 was the removal of
regional disparities through development of
regions with low industrial base. Accordingly,
adequate infrastructure for industrial
development of such regions was duly
emphasized. Given the potential to provide
large-scale employment, the Resolution reiterated
the Government’s determination to provide all
sorts of assistance to small and cottage industries
for wider dispersal of the industrial base and
more equitable distribution of income. The
Resolution, in fact, reflected the prevalent value
system of India in the early 1950s, which was
centered around self sufficiency in industrial
production. The Industrial Policy Resolution
1956 – was a landmark policy statement and it
formed the basis of subsequent policy
announcements.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>1960s and 1970s</i></strong></div>

Before independence there was a strong
tendency for ownership or control of much of
the large-scale private industrial economy to be
concentrated in managing agencies, which
became powerful under the British because they
had access to London money markets. Through
diversified investments and interlocking
directorates, the individuals who controlled the
managing agencies controlled much of the preindependence economy. Private trading and
industrial conglomerates existed under the
British and continued after independence. The
government viewed the conglomerates with
suspicion, believing that they often manipulated
markets and prices for their own profit.
After independence the government
instituted licensing controls on new businesses,
especially in manufacturing, and on expanding
capacity in existing businesses. In the 1960s,
when shortages of goods were extensive,
considerable criticism was leveled at traders for
manipulating markets and prices. 'Monopolies
Inquiry Commission' (MIC) was set up in 1964
to review various aspects pertaining to
concentration of economic power and operations
of industrial licensing under the IDR Act, 1951
(Industries Development and Regulation Act).
While emphasizing that the planned economy
contributed to the growth of industry, the Report
by MIC concluded that the industrial licensing
system enabled big business houses to obtain
disproportionately large share of licenses which
had led to pre-emption and foreclosure of
capacity.
<br>
<br>
Subsequently, the Industrial Licensing Policy
Inquiry Committee (Dutt Committee), constituted
in 1967, recommended that larger industrial
houses should be given licenses only for setting
up industry in core and heavy investment sectors,
thereby necessitating reorientation of industrial
licensing policy. In 1969, The Monopolies and
Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act was
introduced to enable the Government to
effectively control concentration of economic
power. The MRTP Act, 1969 defined large
business houses as those with assets of Rs. 200
million and above. Large industries were
designated as MRTP companies and were not
eligible to participate in industries that were
reserved for the Government or the Small scale
sector.
<br>
<br>
The new Industrial Licensing Policy of 1970
classified industries into four categories. First
category, termed as ‘Core Sector’, consisted of
basic, critical and strategic industries. Second
category termed as ‘Heavy Investment Sector’,
comprised projects involving investment of more
than Rs. 50 million. The third category, the
‘Middle Sector’ consisted of projects with
investment in the range of Rs. 10 million to Rs. 50
million. The fourth category was ‘Delicensed
Sector’, in which investment was less than Rs. 10
million and was exempted from licensing
requirements.
<br>
<br>
Structural deficiencies, such as the need for
institutional changes in agriculture and the
inefficiency of much of the industrial sector, also
contributed to economic stagnation. Wars with
China in 1962 and with Pakistan in 1965 and
1971; a flood of refugees from East Pakistan in
1971; droughts in 1965, 1966, 1971, and 1972;
currency devaluation in 1966; and the first world
oil crisis, in 1973-74, all jolted the economy.
Monopolies and Restrictive Practices Act
1970, which was designed to provide the
government with additional information on the
structure and investments of all firms that had
assets of more than Rs. 200 million, to strengthen
the licensing system in order to decrease the
concentration of private economic power, and
to place restraints on certain business practices
considered contrary to the public interest. The
act emphasized the government's aversion to
large companies in the private sector, but critics
contended that the act resulted from political
motives and not from a strong case against big
firms. The act and subsequent enforcement
restrained private investment. The extensive
controls, the large public sector, and the many
government programs contributed to a
substantial growth in the administrative
structure of government.
<br>
<br>
The government also sought to take on many
of the unemployed. The result was a swollen,
inefficient bureaucracy that took inordinate
amounts of time to process applications and
forms. Business leaders complained that they
spent more time getting government approval
than running their companies. Many observers
also reported extensive corruption in the huge
bureaucracy. One consequence was the
development of a large underground economy
in small-scale enterprises and the services sector.
Industrialization occurred in a protected
environment, which led to distortions that, after
the mid-1960s, contributed to the sagging
industrial growth rate. Tariffs and quantitative
controls largely kept foreign competition out of
the domestic market, and most Indian
manufacturers looked on exports only as a
residual possibility. Industry paid insufficient
attention to the quality of products,
technological development elsewhere, and
economies of scale. Management was weak in
many private and public plants.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>80s: THE WATERSHED YEARS</i></strong></div>

Beginning in the late 1970s, successive Indian
governments sought to reduce state control of
the economy. Progress toward that goal was slow
but steady, and many analysts attributed the
stronger growth of the 1980s to those efforts. The
realization started occurring to country that a
situation as usual approach might have to be
changed, but country needed a shock to do the
course correction, which came in early 1990s.
The rate of growth improved in the 1980s. A
high rate of investment was a major factor in
improved economic growth. Investment went
from about 19 per cent of GDP in the early 1970s
to nearly 25 per cent in the early 1980s. India,
however, required a higher rate of investment
to attain comparable economic growth than did
most other low-income developing countries,
indicating a lower rate of return on investments.
Part of the adverse Indian experience was
explained by investment in large, long-gestating,
capital-intensive projects, such as electric power,
irrigation, and infrastructure. However, delayed
completions, cost overruns, and under-use of
capacity were contributing factors. Private
savings financed most of India's investment, but
by the mid-1980s further growth in private
savings was difficult because they were already
at quite a high level. As a result, during the late
1980s India relied increasingly on borrowing
from foreign sources.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>POLICIES AFTER 1991</i></strong></div>

Until 1991, India’s policy makers followed
misguided policies that closed the economy to
international trade, erected inefficient industries
under state guidance, riddled the private sector
with extraordinarily cumbersome and detailed
regulations, and suffocated private economic
activity with controls and bureaucratic
impediments. Then in 1991, the big
breakthrough happened. Spurred by a balance
of payments crisis, Indian policy makers turned
to technocrats such as Manmohan Singh, who
promptly began the process of liberalizing the
economy. Trade barriers were slashed, foreign
investment was welcomed, the license raj was
dismantled, and privatization began. The
economy started to boom, with software exports
and call centers leading the way.
Foreign lending had virtually dried up, the
government was forced to sell 20 tonnes of gold
to the Union Bank of Switzerland in March 1991
to tide over its immediate transactions. By July
1991, foreign exchange reserves were down to a
mere two weeks' import cover despite loans from
the IMF. The country was at the edge of default.
<br>
<br>
New Economic Policy of 1991 was a
Structural Adjustment Program that allowed
India to qualify for aid from the World Bank and
IMF. In 1990, India faced an economic crisis and
was on the brink of default on its debts. Within
weeks of announcing the reform package, the
government devalued the rupee by 23 per cent
(The devaluation of the rupee had been
advocated by the World Bank since October
1990, when it recommended a 20 per cent
devaluation), raised interest rates, and effected
sharp cuts in subsidies on food and fertilizers
and transfers to public enterprises. Over the next
six months, it abolished the complex system of
industrial and import licensing, liberalized trade
policy, and introduced measures to strengthen
capital markets and institutions.
Among other measures, the new policies
announced by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao in July 1991 included allowing foreign firms
to own a 51 per cent stake in joint ventures in
India instead of the previous 40 per cent. The
government also eliminated requirements for
some 7,500 licenses, eliminated financial support
for in form of export subsidies, and allowed
exporters to keep 30 per cent of their net foreign
exchange earnings (an increase from 5-10
percent).
<br>
<br>
On December 5, 1991, the World Bank made
its largest Structural Adjustment Loan to date:
$500 to India. The watershed reforms contained
in the first budget the new Narasimha Rao
government submitted in June excited the Bank,
and fast track negotiations began. Initially, India
was to receive $300 million, followed by the
remaining $200 million a year later if the
structural adjustment policies it agreed to
remained in place.
Before 1991, India was a nation with political
independence but no economic freedom. If the
license and permit tied India down, they also
stifled individual aspirations. In the early 1990s,
India's post independence development pattern
of strong centralized planning, regulation and
control of private enterprise, state ownership of
many large units of production, trade
protectionism, and strict limits on foreign capital
was increasingly questioned not only by policy
makers but also by most of the intelligentsia.
During this period, considerable progress was
made in loosening government regulations,
especially in the area of foreign trade. Many
restrictions on private companies were lifted, and
new areas were opened to private capital.
However, India remains one of the world's most
tightly regulated major economies. Many
powerful vested interests, including private firms
that have benefited from protectionism, labor
unions, and much of the bureaucracy, opposed
liberalization. Besides, many analysts agree that
the poor suffered most from the increased
inflation rate and reduced growth rate.
India’s economic performance during the
first three decades since independence was
christened the “Hindu” rate of growth, a term
connoting a disappointing but not disastrous
outcome. That cliché, of course, is gradually
lapsing into disuse thanks to the remarkable
transformation in India during the last two
decades. Since 1980, its economic growth rate
has more than doubled, rising from 1.7 per cent
(in per-capita terms) in 1950-1980 to 3.8 per cent
in 1980-2000. Shackled by the socialist policies
and the “license-permit-quota raj” (to use Rajaji’s
memorable phrase) of the past, India used to
serve as the exemplar of development strategies
gone wrong. It has now become the latest poster
child for how economic growth can be unleashed
with a turn towards free markets and open
trade. India has yet to catch up to China’s
growth rates, but thanks to its solid democratic
institutions and impressive performance in
information technology, the country is
increasingly vying with, if not displacing, China
as the country of the future in the eyes of many
knowledgeable observers.
<br>
<br>
By the early 1990s, economic changes led to
the growth in the number of Indians with
significant economic resources. About 10 million
Indians are considered upper class, and roughly
300 million are part of the rapidly increasing
middle class. Typical middle-class occupations
include owning a small business or being a
corporate executive, lawyer, physician, whitecollar worker, or land-owning farmer. In the
1980s, the growth of the middle class was
reflected in the increased consumption of
consumer durables, such as televisions,
refrigerators, motorcycles, and automobiles. In
the early 1990s, domestic and foreign businesses
hoped to take advantage of India's economic
liberalization to increase the range of consumer
products offered to this market.
As India moved into the mid-1990s, the
economic outlook was mixed. Most analysts
believed that economic liberalization would
continue, although there was disagreement
about the speed and scale of the measures that
would be implemented. It seemed likely that India
would come close to or equal the relatively
impressive rate of economic growth attained in
the 1980s, but that the poorest sections of the
population might not benefit.
<br>
<br>
By the mid-1990s, the number of sectors
reserved for public ownership was slashed, and
private-sector investment was encouraged in
areas such as energy, steel, oil refining and
exploration, road building, air transportation,
and telecommunications. An area still closed to
the private sector in the mid-1990s was defense
industry. Foreign-exchange regulations were
liberalized, foreign investment was encouraged,
and import regulations were simplified. The
average import-weighted tariff was reduced.
Despite these changes, the economy
remained highly regulated by international
standards. Moreover, although import duties
had been lowered substantially, they were still
high compared to most other countries. Political
successes in the mid-1990s by nationalistoriented political parties led to some backlash
against foreign investment in some parts of India.
In early 1995, official charges of serving
adulterated products were made against a KFC
outlet in Bangalore, and Pepsi-Cola products
were smashed and advertisements defaced in
New Delhi. The most serious backlash occurred
in Maharashtra in August 1995 when the
Bharatiya Janata Party led state government
halted construction of a US$2.8 million 2,015-
megawatt gas-fired electric-power plant being
built near Bombay (Mumbai in the Marathi
language) by another United States company,
Enron Corporation. However these incidents
remained more of an aberration.
<br>
<br>
It is important to characterize appropriately
this attitudinal change that took place in the early
1980s. A distinction need to be made between a
pro-market and a pro-business orientation. The
former focuses on removing impediments to
markets, and aims to achieve this through
economic liberalization. It favors entrants and
consumers. A pro-business orientation, on the
other hand, is one that focuses on raising the
profitability of the established industrial and
commercial establishments. It tends to favor
incumbents and producers. Easing restrictions
on capacity expansion for incumbents, removing
price controls, and reducing corporate taxes (all
of which took place during the 1980s) are
examples of pro-business policies, while trade
liberalization (which did not take place in any
significant form until the 1990s) is the archetypal
market-oriented policy.
<br>
<br>
Two decades of liberalization in India had a
favorable impact on the overall growth rate of
the economy. This is major improvement given
that India’s growth rate in the 1970’s was very
low at 3% and GDP growth in countries like
Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, and Mexico was more
than twice that of India. Though India’s average
annual growth rate almost doubled in the eighties
to 5.9%, it was still lower than the growth rate
in China, Korea and Indonesia.The pick up in
GDP growth has helped improve India’s global
position. Consequently India’s position in the
global economy has improved from the 8th
position in 1991 to 4th place in 2001; when GDP
is calculated on a purchasing power parity basis.
The slowdown experienced by the Indian
economy in the late 1990s, partially due to the
East Asian and Southeast Asian crisis and a
global slowdown, continued at the turn of the
century. The first few years of the new
millennium were turbulent with oil price hikes,
the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US and a further
global slowdown. Despite this, the Ninth Plan
period, 1996-97 to 2000-01, experienced an
average GDP growth of 5.5 per cent per annum
against the target of 6.5 per cent. This
demonstrated the post-reform Indian economy's
ability to ride through crisis years, maintaining
growth rates well above the 'Hindu rate' of 3 to
3.5 per cent.
<br>
<br>
However, despite the low GDP growth in the
first year of the Tenth Plan and the poor
performance of agriculture in the Plan period,
2002-03 to 2006-07 growth rate was slightly
below the Plan target of 8 per cent. It was a big
achievement. A critical aspect in this connection
is the savings and investment generated by the
economy. Consistentely increasing rate of Gross
Domestic Savings and Investment as a
proportion of GDP in the new millennium led to
this type og growth rates. 'Demographic
dividend' in the form of high savings rate was
goings to continue as the already high proportion
of the Indian population in the working age
group. To ensure fiscal responsibility in view of
higher groth rates, a step was taken with the
passing of the Fiscal Reforms and Budget
Management Act (FRBMA) in August 2003. The
Act was aimed at ensuring fiscal prudence. The
rules of the Act was aimed at ensuring that
revenue deficits be reduced by half per cent or
more of the GDP every tear and be eliminated
altogether by 31 March 2009. The fiscal deficit
was to be reduced by 0.3 per cent or more of the
GDP every year and by 31 March, 2009 it was
to be no more than 3 per cent of GDP.
<br>
<br>
The economy growth rates were
unprecedented 7.7% per year in the Tenth Plan
period. However even at the end of plan, many
people in the country still lacked the basic
requirements for a decent living in terms of
nutrition standards, access to education and
basic health, and also to other public services
such as water supply and sewerage.
Disadvantaged groups, especially the Scheduled
Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the minorities
had benefited less than they should have. Faster,
inclusive and sustainable growth has to be the
mantra of government in such conditions.
Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-2012) began in
very favourable circumstances. But mid way in
the plan period worst economic disaster (since
1930 recession) hit the world and Indian
economy also. The government scaled down the
annual average growth rate of 9 per cent
envisaged in the 11th Plan to 8.1 per cent in view
of the global economic meltdown that began in
2008. According to official estimates, India
achieved an economic growth rate of around 8
per cent during the 11th Five Year Plan period
(2007-12). Though, economic growth has slipped
to decades' low of 5 per cent in 2012-13, the first
year of the 12th Five-Year Plan, due to poor
performance of farm, manufacturing and mining
sectors, fundamentals of economy are strong and
return of Indian growth story is expected sooner.
Despite the global economic crisis that engulfed
the whole world Indian economy only slowed
down and did not go into a declining phase. That
shows the resilience and inner strength of Indian
Economy.
<br>
<br>
A hard landing to the discussion is being
made here, because the current economic
situation will need some time to settle down and
only after the present turmoil is over, one would
be able to give an account of present
developments in a non passionate historical way.

India's leaders believed that industrialization
was the key to economic development. This belief
was all the more convincing in India because of
the country's large size, substantial natural
resources, and desire to develop its own
industries. The Industrial Policy Resolution of
1948 gave government a monopoly in
armaments, atomic energy, and railroads, and
exclusive rights to develop minerals, the iron and
steel industries, aircraft manufacturing,
shipbuilding, and manufacturing of telephone
and telegraph equipment. Private companies
operating in those fields were guaranteed at least
ten years more of ownership before the
government could take them over. Some still
operate as private companies.The Industrial
Policy Resolution of 1956 greatly extended the
preserve of government. There were seventeen
industries exclusively in the public sector. The
government took the lead in another twelve
industries, but private companies could also
engage in production. This resolution covered
industries producing capital and intermediate
goods. As a result, the private sector was relegated
primarily to production of consumer goods.
The public sector also expanded into more
services. In 1956 the life insurance business was
nationalized, and in 1973 the general insurance
business was also acquired by the public sector.
Most large commercial banks were nationalized
in 1969. Over the years, the Central and State
Governments formed agencies, and companies
engaged in finance, trading, mineral
exploitation, manufacturing, utilities, and
transportation. The public sector was extensive
and influential throughout the economy,
although the value of its assets was small relative
to the private sector.
<br>
<br>
Controls over prices, production, and the use
of foreign exchange, which were imposed by the
British during World War II, were reinstated soon
after independence. The Industries (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951 and the
Essential Commodities Act of 1955 (with
subsequent additions) provided the legal
framework for the government to extend price
controls that eventually included steel, cement,
drugs, nonferrous metals, chemicals, fertilizer,
coal, automobiles, tires and tubes, cotton textiles,
food grains, bread, butter, vegetable oils, and
other commodities. By the late 1950s, controls
were pervasive, regulating investment in
industry, prices of many commodities, imports
and exports, and the flow of foreign exchange.
Export growth was long ignored. The
government's extensive controls and pervasive
licensing requirements created imbalances and
structural problems in many parts of the
economy. Controls were usually imposed to
correct specific problems but often without
adequate consideration of their effect on other
parts of the economy. For example, the
government set low prices for basic foods,
transportation, and other commodities and
services, a policy designed to protect the living
standards of the poor. However, the policy
proved counterproductive when the government
also limited the output of needed goods and
services. Price ceilings were implemented during
shortages, but the ceiling frequently contributed
to black markets in those commodities and to
tax evasion by black-market participants. Import
controls and tariff policy stimulated local
manufacturers toward production of importsubstitution goods, but under conditions devoid
of sufficient competition or pressure to be
efficient.
<br>
<br>
India's current economic reforms began in
1985 when the government abolished some of
its licensing regulations and other competitioninhibiting controls. Since 1991 more "new
economic policies" or reforms have been
introduced. Reforms include currency
devaluations and making currency partially
convertible, reduced quantitative restrictions on
imports, reduced import duties on capital goods,
decreases in subsidies, liberalized interest rates,
abolition of licenses for most industries, the sale
of shares in selected public enterprises, and tax
reforms. Although many observers welcomed
these changes and attributed the faster growth
rate of the economy in the late 1980s to them,
others feared that these changes would create
more problems than they solved. The growing
dependence of the economy on imports, greater
vulnerability of its balance of payments, reliance
on debt, and the consequent susceptibility to
outside pressures on economic policy directions
caused concern. The increase in consumerism
and the display of conspicuous wealth by the
elite exacerbated these fears.
But forces of liberalisation, privatisation and
globalisation were not only strengthened with
time, but also the horizontal spread of area under
these forces increased at a faster rate. Promotion
of FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) by means of
raising the cap, constitution of Competition
Commission of India in place of MRTP Act,
liberal act on foreign currency violations, easy
sanction for FDI and FII (Foreign Institutional
Investors) etc. point towards the above
mentioned fact.
