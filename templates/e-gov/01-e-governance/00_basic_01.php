<h3>e-Governance</h3>

e-Governance or ‘electronic governance’ is
basically the application of Information and
Communications Technology to the processes of
Government functioning in order to bring about
‘Simple, Moral, Accountable, Responsive and
Transparent’ (SMART) governance. This would
generally involve the use of ICTs by government
agencies for any or all of the following reasons:
    <br>
    <br>
(a) Exchange of information with citizens, businesses
or other government departments. 
<br>
(b) Speedier and more efficient delivery of public services. 
<br>
(c)Improving internal efficiency.
<br>
(d) Reducing costs /increasing revenue. 
<br>
(e) Re-structuring of administrative processes.
<br>
(f) Improving quality of services.
<br>
<br>
e-Government is not about ‘e’ but about
‘government’; it is not about computers and
websites, but about services to citizens and
businesses. e-Government is also not about
translating processes; it is about transforming them.
e-Government is concerned with the transformation
of government, modernisation of government
processes and functions and better public service
delivery mechanisms through technology so that
government can be put on an auto-pilot mode.
The four pillars of e-Government are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>People</li>
        <li>Process</li>
        <li>Technology</li>
        <li>Resources</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

However the penetration of e-governance and
the skills required to adapt to e-governance are
issues of concern. Further there are issues related
to data access and data security with e-governance
as it is believed that it has made sensitive
government data vulnerable to hackers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Logic of e-Governance:</i></strong></div>

Governance, based on bureaucratic
structures built on rationale principles, that
dominated the twentieth century, has failed to
respond to the changing requirements of the
present times. e-Governance, which is a paradigm
shift over the traditional approaches has emerged
as the answer to the challenges of the contemporary
times. Along with developments in technology the
other important reason for the advent of egovernance has been the rising awareness amongst
the citizens and their better experiences with the
private sector, as a result of which the demand for
better services on the part of government
departments became more pronounced. The
infusion of Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) has played a prominent role in
strengthening such a demand.
<br>
<br>
e-Governance, which is a paradigm shift over
the traditional approaches in administration, means
rendering of government services and information
to the public using electronic means. This new
paradigm has brought about a revolution in the
quality of service delivered to the citizens. It has
ushered in transparency in the governing process;
saving of time due to provision of services through
single window; simplification of procedures; better
office and record management; reduction in
corruption; and improved attitude, behaviour and
job handling capacity of the dealing personnel.
Most of the advanced countries including
United Kingdom (UK), Australia, Canada,
New Zealand, and USA have adopted series of
measures under a new model based on market
principles. This new model has several names such
as: ‘new public management’; ‘market based public
administration’; ‘the post bureaucratic paradigm’;
or ‘entrepreneurial government’. Though these
appear to be different terms yet they convey the
same message i.e. replace the traditional
bureaucratic model with a new model. Have faith
in market principles: cut costs; reduce budgets;
improve public managements, simplify rules and
procedures; check corruption; inject transparency;
and strengthen market forces by minimizing the
role of the state. To make the new system more
effective and ensure efficacy, the use of information
technology in the governance process is
emphasized.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Stages of e-Governance</i></strong></div>

It is evident that e-Governance is intrinsically
linked with the development of computer
technology, networking of computers and
communication systems. In developing countries,
such technologies and systems became available
with a perceptible time lag as compared to
developed nations. However, in the case of India,
with the liberalization of the economy from the
early 1990s onwards, there has been a convergence
in the availability of cutting edge technologies and
opportunities in the field of e-Governance. Generally
speaking, the Indian experience demonstrates that
the onset of e-Governance proceeded through the
following phases:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Computerisation: In the first phase, with the
availability of personal computers, a large
number of Government offices got equipped
with computers. The use of computers began
with word processing, quickly followed by data
processing.</li>
        <li>Networking: In this phase, some units of a few
government organizations got connected
through a hub leading to sharing of information
and flow of data between different government
entities.</li>
        <li>On-line presence: With increasing internet
connectivity, a need was felt for maintaining a
presence on the web. This resulted in
maintenance of websites by government
departments and other entities. Generally, these
web-pages/web-sites contained information
about the organizational structure, contact
details, reports and publications, objectives and
vision statements of the respective government
entities.</li>
        <li>On-line interactivity: A natural consequence
of on-line presence was opening up of
communication channels between government
entities and the citizens, civil society
organizations, etc. The main aim at this stage
was to minimize the scope of personal interface
with government entities by providing
downloadable Forms, Instructions, Acts, Rules,
etc. In some cases, this has already led to online submission of Forms. Most citizengovernment transactions have the potential of
being put on e-Governance mode.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Scope of E-Governance:</i></strong></div>

While e-governance encompasses a wide range
of activities, we can identify three distinct areas.
These include government-to-government (G to G),
government-to-citizens (G to C), and government
to business (G to B). Each of these represents a
different combination of motivating forces.
However, some common goals include improving
the efficiency, reliability, and quality of services for
the respective groups. In many respects, the
government to government (G to G) sector
represents the backbone of e-government. It is felt
that governments at the union, state and local level
must enhance and update their own internal
systems and procedures before electronic
transactions with citizens and business are
introduced. Government to government egovernance involves sharing data and conducting
electronic exchanges between various governmental
agencies. There are number of advantages with
government-to-government initiatives. One benefit
with this is cost savings, which is achieved by
increasing the speed of the transactions, reduction
in the number of personnel necessary to complete
a task, and improving the consistency of outcomes.
Another advantage, which flows from this, is
improvement in the management of public
resources.
<br>
<br>
Government to citizen (G to C) facilitates citizen
interaction with government, which is the primary
goal of e-governance. This attempts to make
transactions, such as payment of taxes, renewing
licenses and applying for certain benefits, less time
consuming and easy to carry out. Government to
citizen initiatives also strive to enhance access to
public information through the use of websites and
kiosks. Further, one of the main goals of
implementing these initiatives has been to create a
“single window” where citizens can carry out
variety of tasks, especially those that involve
multiple government departments, without
requiring the citizen to initiate contacts with each
government department individually. Thus, the G
to C initiatives is driven by an urge to provide
“better government” through improved efficiency
and more reliable outcomes. Government to
Business (G to B) sector includes both the
procurement of goods and services by the
government as well as the sale of surplus
government goods to the public on line. There are
two motivating forces behind G to B. Currently the
business community prefers to carry out its activities
such as sales, procurement, and hiring through
electronic means. There are large numbers of
software companies, which are producing number
of products focusing on performing routine business
activities on line. Thus, many companies like to
extend the cost savings realized through Business
to Business (B to B) transactions to their business
with union, state and local level governments. The
second reason for the growth of G to B is the
demand for cost cutting and efficient procurements
in the government. Developing countries, where
there is great pressure to minimize costs due to
shortage of funds, G to B are being encouraged by
the governmental agencies.
<br>
<br>
<b>E-Government Initiatives in India:</b> An Overview
The Government of India kick started the use
of IT in the government in the right earnest by
launching number of initiatives. First the
Government approved the National E-Governance
Action plan for implementation during the year
2003-2007. The plan was an attempt to lay the
foundation and provide impetus for long-term
growth of e-governance within the country. It
proposed to create the right governance and
institutional mechanisms at the centre, state and
local levels to provide a citizen centric and business
centric environment for governance. While
endorsing the plan, it was observed that: weightage must be given for quality and speed of
implementation in procurement procedures for IT
services; devising of a suitable system of motivating
the states for quick adoption; provision of delivery
of services to the citizens through a single window
etc. should be encouraged. Further, outsourcing of
services wherever and whenever feasible; efforts
be made to promote and develop public private
partnerships to utilize the full potential of private
sector investments; and connectivity should be
improved and extended up to the block level in the
states. Apart from the action plan, the following
measures have also been introduced:


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Adoption of “Information Technology (IT) Act</b>,
2000 by the Government of India to provide
legal framework to facilitate electronic
transactions. The major aims of this Act are to:
recognize electronic contracts, prevents
computer crimes, and make electronic filing
possible. The Act came into force on 17 October,
2000.</li>
        <li>Establishment of the National Taskforce of
Information Technology and Software
Development in May 1998.</li>
        <li>Creation of Centre for e-governance to
disseminate the best practices in the area of egovernance for the use by the Central and State
Governments and act as a nodal Centre to
provide general information on e-governance,
national and international initiatives, and IT
policies of the government(s).</li>
        <li>Developing eoffice solutions to enable various
ministries and departments to do their work
electronically. Modules such as Workflow for
Drafts for Approvals, e-file, submission of
reports, integrated personal information and
financial accounting systems have been
developed.</li>
        <li>Setting up of a High Powered Committee (HPC)
with Cabinet Secretary as its Chairman to
improve administrative efficiency by using
Information Technology in Government.</li>
        <li>Designating a Joint Secretary level officer as IT
manager in every Ministry/ Department;</li>
        <li>Instituting websites by almost all Ministries and
Departments and providing information on
aspects such as their objectives, policies and
decisions, contact persons, etc.
Thus, it can be inferred from the above that a
good beginning has been made to make egovernment a reality in India, but still a lot needs
to be done. Sincere efforts are required on a
sustained basis in future also to maintain the
momentum.
<br>
<br>
Quite a number of state governments have
initiated measures to introduce information
technology and its tools in the governance process.
Most of these states are using these applications
for improving service delivery to their citizens. They
are moving from manual processes to on-line
delivery by using conveniently located service
centres in public places. Counters at these service
centres are manned by public/ private agencies
and multiple services are provided on-line at each
location. Empirical evidence reveals that it has not
been an easy task to implement ICT related reforms
particularly at the state level and hence needs to
be planned carefully for their successful
implementation. In this regard, it is, therefore, of
utmost importance to study and examine the
various experiences for evolving effective strategies
for future.</li>
        <li>Project “Bhoomi” in the State of Karnataka:
Karnataka, being an agrarian state, was faced
with the problem of maintaining immense land
records and the work was done manually by the
revenue officials. The keeping of records regarding
the current ownership of land, cropping pattern
and village maps etc. for three to four villages was
the duty assigned to ‘Patwari’, who was also
entrusted with registering transfers of land due to
sales or other reasons. He had to update the land
records as per procedure, which could take years
for obvious reasons.
The recently launched project ‘Bhoomi’
facilitated computerizations of entire 20 million
records of land ownership of 6.7 million farmers in
the State of Karnataka. At present, computerized
land record kiosk popularly called “Bhoomi centre”
is functional in all the 177 talukas in the state.
These kiosks are used to provide on line support to
farmers at a fee of Rs. 15. Consequently, a request
for change in land ownership due to sale or
inheritance can be made at these ‘Bhoomi Centres’.
The computer on receiving application generates
notices automatically, and is handed over to the
‘patwari’. The process of issuing notices by ‘patwari’
to interested parties remains the same. However,
the Revenue Inspector is expected to approve these
changes in a specified time i.e. within 30 days after
serving the notices. As the approval reaches the
‘Bhoomi Centre’, it is scanned and ‘patwari’ present
at each center maintains the record. The new owner
can receive a copy on demand.
<br>
<br>
With this techno savvy system, it is very easy
to determine the number of executed and pending
orders besides fixing responsibility and holding
officials accountable, thereby curtailing corruption,
whereas earlier, the process took weeks and was
riddled with corruption. Farmers claimed they had
to pay anywhere between Rs. 500 and Rs. 1000 in
bribes to officials”. In addition, the project has also
improved the revenue contributions to the state
treasury:” What’s more, the project has already
started earning large revenue for the state as much
as 7 – 7.5 million rupees every month.
Being difficult to introduce this scheme in all
177 talukas spread throughout the state, the
Government of Karnataka launched the scheme in
phases. Initially, it was introduced only in four
talukas on a pilot basis and later on it was extended
to one pilot taluka in each of the twenty-seven
districts. Finally, it was implemented in all the 177
talukas in the state. The daunting task of
implementation of the project, in spite of poor work
culture and the oppositional attitude of the revenue
staff, was achieved successfully with the active
involvement of the private data entry agencies.
Further, the selections of the officials (patwaris)
were done very carefully. Youngsters/ freshers from
the colleges were recruited and trained to regulate
the Bhoomi Centres under the project leaderadditional secretary of the department. Thus,
project ‘Bhoomi’ came to be a success, as it resulted
in: simplification of procedures; reduced the
hardships of the poor farmers, in terms of delays;
reduced corruption and ensuring a more
accountable, transparent, and responsive system.</li>
        <li>Project “Gyandoot” in the State of Madhya
Pradesh:
 “Gyandoot” was launched on 1 January 2000,
in poverty stricken, tribal-dominated rural areas of
Madhya Pradesh after gathering information from
the villagers regarding their problems. Lack of
information about the rates of agricultural produce,
difficulty in accessing information on land records;
and absence of grievance redressal mechanism were
their main problems. The Government selected
villages, which functioned as block headquarters,
or where weekly markets were held, or villages
along the major roads, for establishing information
kiosks equipped with computers connected through
Internet. These information kiosks were run by rural
educated youth having matriculation with working
knowledge of computers. The services provided at
these kiosks included:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Supplying information regarding current rates
of crops at the local and other auction centres
in the country at a very nominal fee of Rs. 5.</li>
        <li>All documents containing information of land
records to be given on the spot at a fee of Rs.
15.</li>
        <li>All applications with regard to domicile or
income or caste certificates can be sent through
e-mail at a cost of Rs. 10.</li>
        <li>Complaints of poor quality of seeds/fertilizers,
drinking water, functioning or nonfunctioning
of schools or Panchayats, village committees,
etc can be lodged at a cost of Rs. 10.</li>
        <li>Auction facility for land, machinery, and any
other durable commodities at a fee of Rs. 25
for three months; all information on government
development programmes and grants on
various development projects;</li>
        <li>Data regarding families below poverty lines.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


‘Gyandoot’ was observed to be hugely
instrumental in establishing a link between the
government and the local population residing in
the remote villages. It has also provided an
opportunity to the marginalized tribal citizens to
have an access to knowledge at a little cost. The
awards such as the Stockholm Challenge IT Award
2000 in the Public Service and Democracy category
and the CSI-TCS National Award for best IT usage
for the year 2000, were signs of its success which
was attributed to overcoming the biggest hurdle
evidenced in the lack of reliability by efficacious
build up of dial-up connection as most of the rural
telephone exchanges came to be functional with
optical fibre cables, with support from Member of
Parliament of the area. The local, being fully
convinced of the value of the project, helped by
allocating 25 per cent of the development fund for
computer education in the district.</li>
        <li><b>Project “Smart Government” in the State of
Andhra Pradesh:</b>
The Government of Andhra Pradesh, in its
endeavour to provide simple, moral, accountable,
responsive and transparent governance to its
people, launched ‘SMART GOVERNMENT’
(Smartgov) at the secretariat level. This project
resulted in an automatic workflow in the secretariat
and ensured not only internal efficiency but also
provided an effective tool for performance
evaluation. In Smartgov, on receipt of a document,
it is scanned to generate a number for the file and
is e- mailed to the concerned officer. The official
notings are done electronically. The system being
automatic enforces the desired checks and balances.
It curtails negativism and overrides all hurdles of
resistance and opposition to change.
<br>
<br>
The project Smartgov has helped in introducing
paperless file processing system in the Andhra
Pradesh secretariat. It has not only helped in
reducing the time consumed in processing the files,
but also significantly improved the quality of
decisions besides curbing corruption. That the new
governance improvisations/systems because of their
faster, efficacious, efficient and effective remedial
implications have evoked a positive response from
the public in general and the administrative set up
in particular speaks volumes for its acceptability. It
can, thus, be safely inferred that if implementation
of such programmes is preceded with requisite
training and orientation activities for the end users
the total success of effecting changes can be
ensured.</li>
        <li>Project “Sustainable Access” in Rural India
(SARI) in the State of Tamil Nadu:
People in a tiny village called Pathinettangudi,
35km from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, a state in South
India, are enjoying the fruits of IT revolution. They
are using e-mails, voice mail and webcams courtesy
the Sustainable Access in Rural Internet (SARI)
project. Around 30 other villages around
Pathinettangudi are also covered under this project
and are being provided with similar facilities
through ‘Public Access Internet Kiosks’. These
kiosks are established by private initiative of
enterprising individuals who have taken the risk of
investing money in computer, multimedia and other
accessories and have installed user-friendly
softwares, which can be easily understood and used
by local population. The project has received
excellent response from the government and the
public and with the result its patronage is growing
gradually. These Kiosks are a huge success and the
local population is making their use for activities
like downloading application forms for caste, birth
and death certificates and forwarding them
through e-mail to the ‘tehsildar’ etc. Normally,
online takes a week to process this application and
issuance of certificate. Further, as a large number
of youths from the area have gone abroad, the
family members of these youths are saving huge
money on telephone bills. They are paying Rs. 25
an hour for interaction and watching them live on
screen by using web cams. Also, free counselling to
farmers online on agricultural problems is being
made possible with the help of experts from Tamil
Nadu Agricultural University and other research
institutes in the region.</li>
        <li>Project “Sampark” in Chandigarh:
Chandigarh Administration in an effort to
provide a responsive and effective administration
has effectively relied on the Information Technology
mode to ensure better quality services to its citizens.
Its Memorandum of Understanding with IBM has
led to the establishment of ‘IBM e-governance
solution centre’ for the administration, consequently
developing different e-governance applications. A
Project called ‘Sampark’ has been initiated. Under
this project electronic service centres known as
‘Sampark Centres’ have been established at
different locations in the city. These centres provide
different government services such as Payment of
Taxes, Payment of Water, Sewerage, and Electricity
Bills, Payment of Sticker/Postal Challan, issue of
Bus Passes, Issue of Senior Citizen Cards, issue of
Births and Death Certificates, Space Bookings,
Tenant Registrations, Domestic Servants
Registrations, Passport Applications, and selected
Telephone Bills under a single roof thereby reducing
costs and saving time of the customers. Thus, these
centres usher into the anytime, anywhere, and nonstop governance concept.
Moreover, the enhanced timings, courteous staff,
and better physical infrastructure are some other
factors which have made these centers very
popular, as revealed by a recent survey, The reason
for the success of this initiative can be traced through
the way these centre are organized. Providing
multiple services through a single window with a
wide geographic spread is the prime reason.
Another reason is that the costs due to single
window have also come down and it has relieved
the citizens of botheration of visiting different
departments. Availability of air-conditioned service
centres with drinking water, toilet, sitting space,
etc. has resulted in higher satisfaction among the
citizens.’
<br>
<br>
From the above examples we can safely
conclude that with the introduction of e-government
applications, the service delivery mechanisms in
India have made clear departure from the past -
cramped spaces, shabby ambience, long queues,
delaying tendencies of officials, procedural
complexities, direct and indirect demands for bribe,
and inefficiency in work. The introduction of
Information Technology in the governance process
has brought about a revolution in the quality of
service delivered to its citizens. But still there are
several challenges which need the attention of the
policy makers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Benefits of e-Governance</i></strong></div>


e-Governance would lead to:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Better access to information and quality
services for citizens: ICT would make
available timely and reliable information on
various aspects of governance. In the initial
phase, information would be made available
with respect to simple aspects of governance
such as forms, laws, rules, procedures, etc, later
extending to detailed information, including
reports (including performance reports), public
database, decision making processes, etc. As
regards services, there would be an immediate
impact in terms of savings in time, effort and
money, resulting from online and one-point
accessibility of public services backed up by
automation of backend processes. The ultimate
objective of e-Governance is to reach out to
citizens by adopting a life-cycle approach i.e.
providing public services to citizens which
would be required right from birth to death.</li>
        <li>Simplicity, efficiency and accountability in
the government: Application of ICT to
governance combined with detailed business
process reengineering would lead to simplification of complicated processes, weeding out
of redundant processes, simplification in
structures and changes in statutes and regulations. The end result would be simplification
of the functioning of government, enhanced
decision making abilities and increased
efficiency across government – all contributing
to an overall environment of a more accountable
government machinery. This, in turn, would
result in enhanced productivity and efficiency
in all sectors.</li>
        <li>Expanded reach of governance: Rapid growth
of communications technology and its adoption
in governance would help in bringing
government machinery to the doorsteps of the
citizens. Expansion of telephone network, rapid
strides in mobile telephony, spread of internet
and strengthening of other communications
infrastructure would facilitate delivery of a large
number of services provided by the government.
This enhancement of the reach of government
– both spatial and demographic – would also
enable better participation of citizens in the
process of governance.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CORE PRINCIPLES OF e-GOVERNANCE</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>

        <li>e-Governance – a Continuing Process</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Challenges for E-Government in India:
The benefits of information technology have not
been evenly distributed. It has been noticed that
most of the time the benefits of e-Governance are
also reaped by the affluent sections of society. eGovernance has to be comprehensive; mere
introduction of the IT component is not an end in
itself. Comprehensive e-Governance reforms cover
(1) the process, (2) preparedness and the technology
(3) and the people. Introduction of e-Governance
needs process engineering as the first step. Unless
the processes and procedures and even structures
of government are re-engineered so as to be e-
Governance compatible, eGovernance projects
cannot succeed. The technology and the hardware
and software come second, only after the processes
have been re-engineered. And ultimately, in order
to make the reforms sustainable the people in the
concerned departments/agencies have to internalize
the changes. This is also one of the reasons why 
eGovernance projects succeed at the pilot level but
‘when up-scaled’ they become unsustainable.
Therefore a concerted effort has to be made to
direct e-Governance reforms towards the common
man.
<br>
<br>
The governments, both the Union and the States
must make earnest efforts to complete the daunting,
but formidable task of quicker and effective Egovernance Programs by:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Making a policy choice in favour of computerization even 
if it requires huge investments for
the purchase of hardware and software.</li>
            <li>Serious efforts would be required to mobilize
resources for this arduous job. One way to deal
with the situation could be that governments
enter into arrangements for leasing of
computers. This would reduce initial heavy
capital investments. There are a large number
of agencies which would like to fund the leasing
to the departments. Ministry of Finance can be
asked to provide concessions to these agencies.</li>
            <li>Reviewing the IT Act 2000 to address its
weaknesses and incorporate new features to
tackle issues like cyber crime, data security and
document authentication.</li>
            <li>Establishing complete connectivity between
various ministries and departments so that
transfer of files and papers could be done
through Internet thereby choosing efficacious
speed as an alternative to manual labour. To
make this really effective, there is a need to
make databases of various departments compatible with one another.</li>
            <li>Supplying information to the public in a
language that they understand and are
comfortable with, and generally, it is the local
language. As, technology is available by which
transliteration from English into other languages
can be made therefore, the problem is
manageable provided there is enough motivation to do this onerous task.</li>
            <li>Changing the mindset of the government
employees who are used to working only in
the manual mode. This is a big task and needs
patience and careful planning.</li>
            <li>Workshops, seminars, and training programmes
are required to be organized to spread awareness among the employees at all levels.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion:</i></strong></div>
   
Information Technology presents many avenues
for improving governance. It has opened up new
opportunities for governments to manage things
differently and in a more efficient manner by
utilizing information effectively and re-engineering
processes. ICT tools are emerging as important
instruments towards the goal of “good governance”.
Many countries have launched specific initiatives
for open government. Freedom of information is
being redefined and supported by ICT. India’s Right
to Information Act, 2005 is a prime example in this
regard. ICT has facilitated a conscious attempt to
bring the citizen to the centre-stage. Citizens are
being perceived as customers and clients rather than
beneficiaries. The internet revolution coupled with
rapid advances in communication have proved to
be a powerful tool for citizen-centric governance.
An important dimension of the Internet potential
is the possibility of providing public services
anytime, anywhere.
<br>
<br>
Last but not the least, we should not forget
that e-governance is no magic wand which will
wipe out all the problems and challenges of
administration in no time rather it is one of the
instruments which have the capacity to dilute the
intensity of the serious problems like corruption,
red tapism, insensitivity to the grievances of the
citizens etc. These problems have got their ultimate
solutions only in improving the morale, motivation
and achievement orientation of the bureaucracy
and e-governance is just one clog of the wheel.
Further there are other capacities of e-governance
viz. in the field of crime investigation, grievance
redressal, awareness creation etc. Thus there is also
a need for a detailed exploration of the scope of its
potential so that the return on the investment on
technology can be maximized.
