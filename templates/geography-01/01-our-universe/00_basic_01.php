<h3>Our Universe</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Origin</i></strong></div>


<b><i>The big bang theory</i></b> explains the origin of our
universe. According to this theory, 15 billion years
ago, cosmic matter was in a compressed state from
which expansion started by a primordial
explosion. The super-dense ball broke to form
galaxies, which again broke to form stars and
finally stars broke to form planets including earth.
<br>
<br>
Since the outer space is limitless, conventional
units for measuring distances are not suitable.
Hence new units as follows are used:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Light Year:</b> Distance covered by light in
one year in vacuum at a speed of 3x108
m/s. One light year is equal to 9.46 x
1012 kilometers.</li>
        <li><b>Astronomical Unit:</b> The Mean distance
between the Sun and the Earth (1.49 x
108 km). One light year is equal to 60,000 AU.</li>
        <li><b>Cosmic Year:</b> Sun's period of revolution
around the galactic centre (250 million years). Also called as 'galactic year'</li>
        <li><b>Parsec:</b> Distance at which the mean radius of the Earth's orbit subtends an
angle of one second of an arc. It is equal
to 3.26 light years.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Galaxies</i></strong></div>

These are huge congregation of stars that hold
together by force of gravity e.g. the Milky Way,
Andromeda galaxy, large and small magellanic
cloud, Ursa Minor system, sculptor system, etc.
Milky Way or Akashganga is our home galaxy.
Our solar system is located in this galaxy.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Stars</i></strong></div>

Stars are self luminous bodies that account
for 98 percent of the matter in a galaxy. In the
universe, some stars appear small but emit more
energy than the other stars of the Milky Way.
Such stars are called 'Quasars'. When the dense
galactic nucleus is compressing to form a star, this
stage in star formation is called a 'protostar' stage.
Due to high temperature hydrogen converts to
helium and heat and light is emitted. Thus a star
is formed. When the hydrogen of a star is depleted,
its outer regions swell and redden. This stage of a
star is called a 'Red Giant'. Our sun will turn into
a 'Red Giant' in 5 billion years. 'Novae Stars' are
stars whose brightness increases suddenly by 10
to 20 magnitudes due to explosion and then the
stars again fade into normal brightness. 'Super
Novae' are stars whose brightness suddenly
increases by more than 20 magnitudes. After the
explosion, the dense core of comparatively smaller
stars is called the 'white dwarf'. The dense core
of the comparatively larger stars is called the
'Neutron star'. The neutron star rotates at a high
speed emitting radio waves. Such stars are called
'Pulsar'. 'Black hole' stage of the star occurs when
the ancient star collapses. Gravity becomes so
intense in the hole that nothing escapes, even
light.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constellations</i></strong></div>

In the sky at night there are various patterns
formed by different groups of stars. These are
called constellations. Ursa Major or Big Bear is
one such constellation. One of the most easily
recognizable constellations is the small bear or
Saptarishi (Sapta-seven, Rishi-sages). It is a group
of seven stars that forms a part of the large Ursa
Major Constellation.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Solar System</i></strong></div>

The sun along with its eight planets, asteroids
and comets comprise the 'solar system'. The planets
are divided into inner or terrestrial planets which
have higher densities e.g. Mercury, Venus, Earth
and Mars and outer planets which have lower
densities e.g. Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and
Neptune.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        The Sun
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>The sun is in the center of the solar system.</li>
                <li>It is made up of extremely hot gases particularly hydrogen.</li>
                <li>The sun is 109 times bigger than the
earth and weighs 2 x 1027 tonnes.</li>
                <li>The sun is about 150 million km away
from the earth. The light from the sun
reaches earth in about 8 minutes.</li>
                <li>The glowing surface of the sun is called
'Photosphere'. Above the 'Photosphere'
is red coloured 'Chromosphere'. Beyond
the Chromosphere is the 'Corona', visible during eclipses.</li>
                <li>The temperature of the photosphere is
about 6000°C and that of the Chromosphere is about 32400°C, and that of the
corona about 2,700,000°C. The core of
the sun has a temperature about 15
million degrees Kelvin. But that tremendous heat is not felt so much by us because despite being our nearest star, it is
far away from us.</li>
                <li>It takes 250 million years to complete
one revolution round its centre. This
period is called 'Cosmic year'.</li>
                <li>Sun spots' are dark patches notched on
the surface of the sun. They appear dark
because they are cooler i.e. they have a
temperature of about 1500°C.</li>
                <li>The 'Aurora Borealis' or northern lights
are multicoloured lights that sweep
across the sky in waves and are visible
in the arctic region. The 'Aurora Australis' or southern lights are similarly
visible near the Antarctica region.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Moon</i></strong></div>

        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>The moon is the only satellite of the earth.</li>
                <li>Its size is approximately one-fourth that
of the earth. It has a diameter of 3475 km.</li>
                <li>Its orbit is elliptical. The maximum distance (apogee) of the moon from the
earth is 406,000 km and the minimum
distance (perigee) is 364,000 km.</li>
                <li>The moon moves around the earth in
about 27 days. It takes exactly the same
time to complete one spin. As a result,
only one side of the moon is visible to us
on the earth.</li>
                <li>The bright parts of the moon are mountains whereas the dark patches are lowlying plains.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Asteroids</i></strong></div>
        
Asteroids are a series of very small planets or
fragments of planets lying between the orbit of
Mars and that of Jupiter. They number about
45,000. 'Ceres' whose length is about 1000km is
the largest one. They revolve around the sun in
the same way as the planets.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Meteors and Meteorites</i></strong></div>
        
The meteors are the remains of comets which
are scattered in the interplanetary space of the
solar system. On contact with the earth's
atmosphere, they burn due to friction. Those
which completely burn out into ash are called
meteors or 'shooting star.' Those which do not
burn completely and strike the earth in the form
of rocks are called 'meteorites'.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Planetary System</i></strong></div>
        
There are eight planets in our solar system.
They are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Earlier, Pluto was
considered as a planet. But recently it has lost this
status. All the eight planets of the solar system
move around the sun in fixed paths. These paths
are elongated. They are called orbits. A new planet
2003 UB 313 has been discovered recently in our
solar system. It is bigger than Pluto and farthest
from the Sun.

frigid.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Venus</i></strong></div>

because its size and shape are very much
similar to that of the earth.</li>
<li>It is also called the 'morning' or 'evening
star'.</li>

<li>The atmospheric pressure is 100 times that
of the earth.</li>
<li>It has no satellite.
</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Earth</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The earth is the third nearest planet to the
Sun.</li>
        <li>In size, it is the fifth largest planet.</li>
        <li>It is slightly flattened at the poles. That is
why its shape is described as a Geoid.</li>
        <li>From the outer space, the earth appears
blue because its two-thirds surface is
covered by water. It is, therefore, called a
blue planet.</li>

    </ul>

</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pluto from Planet to Plutoid</i></strong></div>

Pluto, demoted from planet status in 2006,
got a consolation prize - it and other dwarf planets
like it will be called plutoids. Plutoids are celestial
bodies in orbit around the Sun at a distance
greater than that of Neptune that have sufficient
mass for their hydrostatic equilibrium (nearspherical) shape. The two known plutoids are
Pluto and Eris. It is expected that more plutoids
will be named as science progresses and new
discoveries are made.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Motions of the Earth</i></strong></div>

The earth has two main motions: (i) Rotation
and (ii) Revolution.
The axis of the earth, which is an imaginary
line, makes an angle of 66½° with its orbital plane.
The plane formed by the orbit is known as
the orbital plane. The earth receives light from
the sun. Due to the spherical shape of the earth,
only half of it gets light from the sun at a time.
The portion facing the sun experiences day while
the other half away from the sun experiences
night. The circle that divides the day from night
on the globe is called the circle of illumination.
This circle does not coincide with the axis as you
see in the given figure.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rotation:</b> The earth rotates around its axis.
The axis is an imaginary line passing through the
centre of the earth. The earth completes one
rotation in 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.09 seconds to
be exact. The earth rotates from west to east. The
period of rotation is known as the earthday.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effects of the Rotation of the Earth</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Causation of day and night</li>
        <li>A difference of 1 hour between two
meridians which are 15°apart.</li>
        <li>Deflection of ocean currents and winds.</li>
        <li>Rise and fall of tides every day</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Revolution:</b> It is earth's motion in its elliptical
orbit around the sun. One revolution is completed
in 365 1/4 days, resulting in one extra day every
fourth year. The year, consisting of 366 days is
called a "leap year" having 29 days in the month
of February.
<br>
<br>
A year is usually divided into summer, winter,
spring and autumn seasons. Seasons change due
to the change in the position of the earth around
the sun.
<br>
<br>
On 21st June, the Northern Hemisphere is
tilted towards the sun. The rays of the sun fall
directly on the Tropic of Cancer. As a result, these
areas receive more heat. The areas near the poles
receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting.
The North Pole is inclined towards the sun and
the places beyond the Arctic Circle experience
continuous daylight for about six months. Since
a large portion of the Northern Hemisphere is
getting light from the sun, it is summer in the
regions north of the equator. The longest day and
the shortest night at these places occur on 21st
June. At this time in the Southern Hemisphere all
these conditions are reversed. It is winter season
there. The nights are longer than the days. This
position of the earth is called the Summer
Solstice.
<br>
<br>
On 22nd December, the Tropic of Capricorn
receives direct rays of the sun as the South Pole
tilts towards it. As the sun's rays fall vertically at
the Tropic of Capricorn (23½° S), a larger portion
of the Southern Hemisphere gets light. Therefore,
it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere with
longer days and shorter nights. The reverse
happens in the Northern Hemisphere. This
position of the earth is called the Winter Solstice.
On 21st March and September 23rd, direct
rays of the sun fall on the equator. At this position,
neither of the poles is tilted towards the sun; so,
the whole earth experiences equal days and equal
nights. This is called an equinox.
On 23rd September, it is autumn season in
the Northern Hemisphere and spring season in
the Southern Hemisphere. The opposite is the case
on 21st March, when it is spring in the Northern
Hemisphere and autumn in the Southern
Hemisphere. Thus, we find that there are days
and nights and changes in the seasons because of
the rotation and revolution of the earth
respectively.
<br>
<br>
Some terminologies related to revolution are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Perihelion:</b> The position of the earth
when it is at its nearest point to the sun.
The earth reaches its perihelion on about
3rd January at a distance of about 147
million km from the sun.</li>
        <li><b>Aphelion:</b> The position of the earth
when it is at its greatest distance from
the sun. The earth reaches its aphelion
on 4th July when it is at a distance of
152 million km from the sun.</li>
        <li><b>Perigee:</b> The point in the orbit of the
moon when it is nearest to the earth.</li>
        <li><b>Apogee:</b> The point in the orbit of the
moon when it is farthest from the earth.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effects of the Revolution of the Earth</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Change of seasons.</li>
        <li>Variation in the lengths of day and night
at different times of the year.</li>
        <li>Shifting of wind belts.</li>
        <li>Determination of latitudes.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lattitude and Longitude</i></strong></div>


<b>Latitude:</b>
<br>
Latitude of a place on the earth is the angular
distance of the place from the equator. 1° of
latitude is approximately equal to 111 km.
Parallels of Latitude: They are circles drawn
on the globe parallel to the equator. All the places
on a parallel of latitude will have the same
latitudinal angle.
<br>
<br>
Important Parallels of Latitude
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Equator-0°</li>
        <li>Tropic of Cancer-23 ½°N</li>
        <li>Tropic of Capricorn-23½°S</li>
        <li>Arctic circle-66½°N</li>
        <li>Antarctic circle-66½°S</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Heat Zones of the Earth</i></strong></div>

The mid-day sun is exactly overhead at least
once a year on all latitudes in between the Tropic
of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. This area,
therefore, receives the maximum heat and is called
the Torrid Zone.
<br>
<br>
The mid-day sun never shines overhead on
any latitude beyond the Tropic of Cancer and the
Tropic of Capricorn. The angle of the sun's rays
goes on decreasing towards the poles. As such,
the areas bounded by the Tropic of Cancer and
the Arctic Circle in the Northern Hemisphere, and
the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle
in the Southern Hemisphere, have moderate
temperatures. These are, therefore, called
Temperate Zones.
<br>
<br>
Areas lying between the Arctic Circle and the
North Pole in the Northern Hemisphere and the
Antarctic Circle and the South Pole in the
Southern Hemisphere, are very cold. It is because
here the sun does not rise much above the
horizon. Therefore, its rays are always slanting.
These are, therefore, called Frigid Zones.
Great Circles: Any circle which divides a
globe into hemispheres is a great circle. The
equator is a great circle and Greenwich meridian
together with meridian 180° make another great
circle. The number of great circle is limitless. Great
circle can extend in any direction: east to west,
north to south, north east to south west, and so
on. Great circles are of equal length.
<br>
<br>
<b>Longitude:</b>
<br>
The longitude shows the distance of a point
east or west of the Prime Meridian which is at 0°
and passes through Greenwich, near London. For
each degree of longitude there is a difference of
four minutes in time.
<br>
<br>
<b>Longitude and Time:</b> The best means of
measuring time is by the movement of the earth
and the moon. The sun regularly rises and sets
every day, and naturally, it is the best time-keeper
throughout the world.
<br>
<br>
When the Prime Meridian has the sun at the
highest point in the sky, all the places along this
meridian will have mid-day or noon. As the earth
rotates from west to east, those places east of
Greenwich will be ahead of Greenwich time and
those to the west will be behind it. The rate of
difference can be calculated as follows. The earth
rotates 360° in about 24 hours, which means 15°
an hour or 1° in four minutes. Thus, when it is 12
noon at Greenwich, the time at 15° east of
Greenwich will be 15 × 4 = 60 minutes, i.e., 1 hour
ahead of Greenwich time, which means 1 p.m.
But at 15° west of Greenwich, the time will be
behind Greenwich time by one hour, i.e., it will
be 11.00 a.m. Similarly, at 180°, it will be midnight
when it is 12 noon at Greenwich.
<br>
<br>
<b>Greenwich Mean Time:</b> The local time at
Greenwich or any place on the Prime Meridian.
All meridians to the east of Greenwich meridian
have sunrise before that meridian. Local times
along these meridians are therefore ahead of
G.M.T. Meridians to the west of Greenwich
meridian have sunrise after this meridian and
therefore their local times are behind G.M.T.
Standard Time: A particular meridian of
longitude passing through a country is chosen as
the reference meridian. The local time along this
meridian, calculated with respect to Greenwich
Mean Time in terms of its longitude is taken as
the Standard Time for that country.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Why do we have standard time?</i></strong></div>

The local times of places which are on different
meridians are bound to differ. For example, it will
be difficult to prepare a time-table for trains which
cross several longitudes. In India, for instance,
there will be a difference of about 1 hour and 45
minutes in the local times of Dwarka in Gujarat
and Dibrugarh in Assam. It is, therefore, necessary
to adopt the local time of some central meridian
of a country as the standard time for the country.
Indian Standard Time: Time along 82 ½° E
meridians, calculated with respect to G.M.T.
India, for being a large country, is unusual in
having a single time zone all over the country. It
is 5½ hours ahead of G.M.T.
International Date Line: An imaginary
zigzag line on the globe, approximately along the
180° meridian of longitude. When a person
crosses this line from East to West, he gains one
day and when he crosses from West to East, he
loses one day.
<br>
<br>
<b>Solar Day:</b> It is the time interval between
successive crossings of the sun across the meridian
of the celestial sphere of any fixed place in the
same direction. This is equal to 24 hours.
Sidereal Day: The period of rotation of the
earth about its axis. This is calculated with respect
to any fixed star. It is 4 minutes less than 24 hours.
Solar Year (Tropical year): It is the average
interval between successive returns of the sun in
its apparent motion along the ecliptic to a fixed
position on the celestial sphere of any fixed place.
This is equal to 365.24 mean solar days.
Sidereal Year: The period of revolution of the
earth around the sun. It is calculated with
reference to any fixed star. It is approximately
equal to 365.26 days.
<br>
<br>
To account for 1/4 of a day in a year, the
leap year system is adopted in the Gregorian
calendar. To account for the excess of 11 minutes
in a year, the centurial year is considered a leap
year only when it is divisible by 400.

Earth is the only planet which has life.
Human beings can live here because the life
sustaining elements of land, water and air are
present on the earth. The surface of the earth is a
complex zone in which three main components
of the environment meet, overlap and interact.
The solid portion of the earth on which we live is
called the lithosphere. The gaseous layers that
surround the earth, is the atmosphere, where
oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and other gases
are found. Water covers a very big area of the
earth's surface and this area is called the
hydrosphere. The hydrosphere comprises water
in all its forms, that is, ice, water and water
vapour. The biosphere is the narrow zone where
we find land, water and air together, which
contains all forms of life.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lithosphere</i></strong></div>

The solid portion of the earth is called the
lithosphere. It comprises the rocks of the earth's
crust and the thin layers of soil that contain
nutrient elements which sustain organisms. There
are two main divisions of the earth's surface. The
large landmasses are known as the continents
and the huge water bodies are called the ocean
basins. All the oceans of the world are connected
with one another. The level of seawater remains
the same everywhere. Elevation of land is
measured from the level of the sea, which is taken
as zero.
<br>
<br>
The highest mountain peak Mt. Everest is
8,848 metres above the sea level. The greatest
depth of 11,022 metres is recorded at Mariana
Trench in the Pacific Ocean.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Continents</i></strong></div>

There are seven major continents. These are
separated by large water bodies. These continents
are - Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South
America, Australia and Antarctica.
<br>
<br>
Asia is the largest continent. It covers about
one-third of the total land area of the earth. The
continent lies in the Eastern Hemisphere. The
Tropic of Cancer passes through this continent.
Asia is separated from Europe by the Ural
Mountains on the west. The combined landmass
of Europe and Asia is called the Eurasia (Europe + Asia).
<br>
<br>
Europe is much smaller than Asia. The
continent lies to the west of Asia. The Arctic Circle
passes through it. It is bound by water bodies on
three sides.
<br>
<br>
Africa is the second largest continent after
Asia. The Equator or 0° latitude runs almost
through the middle of the continent. A large part
of Africa lies in the Northern Hemisphere. It is
the only continent through which the Tropic of
Cancer, the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn
pass. The Sahara Desert, the world's largest hot
desert, is located in Africa. The continent is bound
on all sides by oceans and seas. The world's
longest river, the Nile, flows through Africa.
North America is the third largest continent
of the world. It is linked to South America by a
very narrow strip of land called the Isthmus of
Panama. The continent lies completely in the
Northern and Western Hemisphere. Three oceans
surround this continent.
<br>
<br>
South America lies mostly in the Southern
Hemisphere. The Andes, world's longest
mountain range, runs through its length from
north to south. South America has the world's
largest river, the Amazon.
Australia is the smallest continent that lies
entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. It is
surrounded on all sides by the oceans and seas. It
is called an island continent.
<br>
<br>
Antarctica, completely in the Southern
Hemisphere, is a huge continent. It is larger than
the combined area of Europe and Australia. The
South Pole lies almost at the centre of this
continent. As it is located in the South Polar
Region, it is permanently covered with thick ice
sheets. There are no permanent human
settlements. Many countries have research
stations in Antarctica. India also has research
stations there. These are named as Maitri and
Dakshin Gangotri.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hydrosphere</i></strong></div>

The earth is called the blue planet. More than
71 per cent of the earth is covered with water
and 29 per cent is with land. Hydrosphere consists
of water in all its forms. As running water in
oceans and rivers and in lakes, ice in glaciers,
underground water and the water vapour in
atmosphere, all comprise the hydrosphere. More
than 97% of the Earth's water is found in the
oceans and is too salty for human use. A large
proportion of the rest of the water is in the form
of ice-sheets and glaciers or under the ground and
a very small percentage is available as fresh water
for human use.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Oceans</i></strong></div>

Oceans are the major part of hydrosphere.
They are all interconnected. The ocean waters are
always moving. The three chief movements of
ocean waters are the waves, the tides and the
ocean currents. The four major oceans are the
Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian
Ocean and the Arctic Ocean, in order of their size.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean. It is
spread over one-third of the earth. Mariana
Trench, the deepest part of the earth, lies under
the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is circular
in shape. Asia, Australia, North and South
Americas surround it.
<br>
<br>
The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest
Ocean in the world. It is 'S' shaped. It is flanked
by the North and South Americas on the western
side, and Europe and Africa on the eastern side.
The coastline of Atlantic Ocean is highly indented.
This irregular and indented coastline provides
ideal location for natural harbours and ports.
From the point of view of commerce, it is the
busiest Ocean.
<br>
<br>
The Indian Ocean is the only ocean named
after a country, that is, India. The shape of ocean
is almost triangular. In the north, it is bound by
Asia, in the west by Africa and in the east by
Australia.
<br>
<br>
The Arctic Ocean is located within the Arctic
Circle and surrounds the North Pole. It is
connected with the Pacific Ocean by a narrow
stretch of shallow water known as Bering Strait.
It is bound by northern coasts of North America
and Eurasia.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Atmosphere</i></strong></div>

The earth is surrounded by a layer of gas
called the atmosphere. This thin blanket of air is
an integral and important aspect of the planet. It
provides us with the air we breathe and protects
us from the harmful effects of sun's rays. The
atmosphere extends up to a height of about 1,600
km.
<br>
<br>
The atmosphere is divided into five layers
based on composition, temperature and other
properties. These layers starting from earth's
surface are the troposphere, the stratosphere, the
mesosphere, the thermosphere and the exosphere.
The atmosphere is composed mainly of
nitrogen and oxygen, which make up about 99
per cent of clean, dry air. Nitrogen 78 per cent,
oxygen 21 per cent and other gases like carbon
dioxide, argon and others comprise 1% by volume.
The density of the atmosphere varies with
height. It is maximum at the sea level and
decreases rapidly as we go up. The climbers
experience problems in breathing due to this
decrease in the density of air. The temperature
also decreases as we go upwards.
The atmosphere exerts pressure on the earth.
This varies from place to place. Some areas
experience high pressure and some areas low
pressure. Air moves from high pressure to low
pressure. Moving air is known as wind.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Biosphere</i></strong></div>
 
The biosphere is the narrow zone of contact
between the land, water and air. It is in this zone
that life exists. All the living organisms including
humans are linked to each other and to the
biosphere for survival. The organisms in the
biosphere may broadly be divided into the plant
kingdom and the animal kingdom.
<br>
<br>
The three domains of the earth interact with
each other and affect each other in some way or
the other. For example, cutting of forests for
fulfilling our needs of wood, or clearing land for
agriculture may lead to fast removal of soil from
slopes. Similarly earth's surface may be changed
due to natural calamities like earthquakes or
tsunamis.
Discharge of waste material into lakes and
rivers makes the water unsuitable for human use.
It also damages other forms of life. Emission from
industries, thermal power plants and vehicles,
pollute the air. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an
important constituent of air. But increase in the
amount of CO2 leads to increase in global
temperatures. This is termed as global warming.
There is thus, a need to limit the use of resources
of the earth to maintain the balance of nature
between the domains of the lithosphere, the
atmosphere and the hydrosphere.
