<h3>Interior Infrastructure of Earth</h3>


The interior of the earth can be understood
only by indirect evidences as no one has reached
the interior of the earth. The surface
configuration of the earth is largely a product of
the processes operating in its interior. A proper
understanding of the physiographic character
of a region remains incomplete unless the effects
of both endogenic processes as well as exogenic
processes are studied.
<br>
<br>
Sources of information about the interior
The earth’s radius is 6,370 km. Reaching the
centre of the earth and make observations or
collect samples of the materials is almost
impossible. Under such conditions, most of our
knowledge about the interior of the earth is
largely based on analogies and inferences. Yet,
a part of the information is obtained through
direct observations and analysis of materials.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Direct Sources</i></strong></div>

The readily available solid earth material is
surface rock we get from mining areas. Besides
mining, scientists world over are working on two
major projects such as “Deep Ocean Drilling
Project” and “Integrated Ocean Drilling
Project”. The deepest drill at Kola, in Arctic
Ocean, has so far reached a depth of 12 km.
These drilling projects have provided large
volume of information through the analysis of
materials collected at different depths. Volcanic
eruption forms another source of obtaining
direct information. As and when the magma
comes out to the surface of the earth during
volcanic eruption it becomes available for
laboratory analysis.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indirect Sources</i></strong></div>

Analysis of properties of rocks and magma
indirectly provides information about the
interior. Through mining we know that
temperature and pressure increase with the
increasing depth. It is also known that the density
of the material also increases with depth.
Scientists have estimated the values of
temperature, pressure and the density of
materials at different depths.
<br>
<br>
Meteor is another source of information about
the interior of the earth. However, the material,
that becomes available for analysis from meteors,
is not from the interior of the earth. It is only
similar to that of the earth. Meteors are solid
bodies developed out of materials same as, or
similar to, earth. So, by analogy meteors provide
valuable information about the earth’s interior.
Other indirect sources include gravitation,
magnetic field and seismic activity. The
gravitational force is greater near the poles and
less at the equator. It also differs according to the
mass of material. Thus the uneven distribution of
material within the earth influences its value. The
readings of the gravity, may, at places differ from
the expected values. Such a difference is called
gravity anomaly. Gravity anomalies give us
information about the distribution of mass of the
material in the crust of the earth.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Seismic/Earthquake Waves</i></strong></div>

The study of seismic waves provides a
complete picture of the layered interior. An
earthquake in simple words is shaking of the
earth. It is a natural event. It is caused due to
release of energy, which generates waves that
travel in all directions. The energy waves
travelling in different directions reach the surface.
Earthquake waves are basically of two typesbody waves and surface waves. Body waves are
generated due to the release of energy at the focus
and move in all directions travelling through the
body of the earth. They interact with the surface
rocks and generate new set of waves called
surface waves. These waves move along the
surface. The velocity of waves changes as they
travel through materials with different densities.
Denser the material, higher is the velocity.
There are two types of body waves. They
are called P and S-waves. P-waves move faster
and are the first to arrive at the surface. These are
also called ‘primary waves’. The P-waves are
similar to sound waves. They travel through all
materials gaseous, liquid and solid. S-waves arrive
at the surface with some time lag. These are called
secondary waves. S-waves can travel only
through solid materials. This characteristic of the
S-waves has helped scientists to understand the
structure of the interior of the earth.
Different waves travel in different manners.
P-waves vibrate parallel to the direction of the
wave. This exerts pressure on the material in the
direction of the propagation. As a result, it
creates density differences in the material leading
to stretching and squeezing of the material.
Other waves vibrate perpendicular to the
direction of propagation. The direction of
vibrations of S-waves is perpendicular to the
wave direction in the vertical plane. Hence, they
create troughs and crests in the material medium
through which they pass. Surface waves are
considered to be the most damaging waves.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Shadow Zone</i></strong></div>

Earthquake waves are recorded in
seismographs located at far off locations.
However, there are certain areas where the
waves are not reported. Such a
zone, where the waves are not recorded, is called
the ‘shadow zone’. The study reveals that for
each earthquake, there exists an altogether
different shadow zone. Given figure shows the
shadow zones of P and S-waves.
It was observed that seismographs, located
within 105° from the epicentre, recorded the
arrival of both P and S-waves. But, beyond 140°
from epicentre, they record the arrival of P-waves,
but not that of S-waves. Thus, a zone between
105° and 140° from epicentre is identified as the
shadow zone of P-waves. However, the entire
zone beyond 105° does not receive S-waves. Thus
shadow zone of S-wave is much larger than that
of the P-waves. The shadow zone of P-waves
appears as a band around the earth between 105°
and 140° away from the epicentre whereas that
of S-wave is a continuous zone.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Structure of the interior</i></strong></div>

Just like an onion, the earth is made up of
several concentric layers with one inside another.
The important zones include:
<br>
<b>The crust:</b> The outer layer of the earth is
known as the crust. It comprises about 0.5% of
the earth’s body. Its thickness ranges from 5 to 40
km. The crust is thicker beneath the continents
than beneath the oceans. It is made up of two
layers: upper lighter layer (density=2.7 g/cc)
called the sial (silica + aluminium) and a lower
denser layer (density=3.0 g/cc) called sima (silica
+ magnesium). The average density of the earth’s
surface is less than 3 gm/c.c. The upper layer of
the crust is mainly com- posed of crystalline
igneous and meta- morphic rocks, acidic in
nature. The lower layer of the crust contains
basaltic & ultra-basic rocks. Conrad discontinuity
separates the outer and the inner crusts.
<br>
<b>The mantle:</b> Below the crust of the earth is
a thick layer called mantle. This layer extends upto a
depth of 2900 km. The mantle consists
predominantly of solid olivine rocks made up of
silicates of magnesium and iron and displaying
plastic properties. Its average density is 56.8. This
layer is separated from the crust by Mohorovicic
Discontinu- ity. The outer and the inner mantle
are separated by another discontinuity named
Repetti discontinuity.
<br>
<b>The core:</b> Beyond a depth of 2900 km lies
the core of the earth. It is named as barysphere
and also nife (nickel and ferrous). Average
thickness is 4671 kms. Average density is 17.2.
By volume it constitutes 17% of the earth’s body.
The temperature of the core is about 200°c. The
core is believed to be a reason for the earth’s
magnetism. It is separated from the mantle by
Gutenburg-Wiechert Discontinuity.
<br>
<b>Lithosphere & Aesthenosphere:</b> Beneath
the upper mantle there is a soft layer in which
the mantle rock is at the temperature close to
the melting point. It sets in at an average depth
of about 80 km which is well below the base of
the continental crust. This layer is called as
“Aesthenosphere” and the rigid layer above it
is called as “lithosphere”. The aesthenosphere
extends to a depth of about 400 km.

<!-- table ends here -->
<b>Temperature:</b> In upper 100 km the
increase in temperature is estimated at the rate
of 12°C per km descend. In the next 300 km,
the increase is of 2°C per km and below that
the rate of increase is 1°C per km. In the core
the temperature is about 2000°C. But at the
same time there is a huge pressure of overlying
layers of the earth’s interior. So even under
extremely high temperature towards the
central part of the earth the liquid nature of
the earth core has acquired the properties of a
solid and is probably in a plastic state.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Continental drift</i></strong></div>

The theory of continental drift, expounded
by Alfred Wegener in 1915, holds that portions
of the original continent which comprised the
entire landmass of the world underwent a series
of horizontal displacement before the present
continents were formed.
<br>
<br>
According to this theory, about 280 million
years ago, the entire landmass formed one super
continent, called Pangea. According to
Wegener, after the breaking of the super
continent pangae, the movement of the
continents took place in two directions- one
towards the equator due to centrifugal force of
the earth which gave rise to fold mountains like
the Himalayas, the alps, etc. and another towards
west due to tidal force of sun and the moon which
gave rise to Andes and Rockies.
A glance at the world map shows that S.
America particularly Brazil can be fitted into the
Gulf of Guinea of Africa; Antarctica can roughly
be fitted into S. Australian coast and S.E-African
coast. Similarly NW-Australian coast and EIndian coast are liable to fit. After the drifts some
water bodies developed between them. Geological
evidences prove that S. America and Africa were
probably joined together till the upper Triassic.
Biological history of certain animals like
marsupials and placental mammals also throw
significant light on the continental drift.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Plate Tectonics</i></strong></div>

Plate tectonics deals with rock structures
which are in the form of the plates and it is not
only the continents which are in motion but the
oceans as well. These plates include not only the
earth’s upper crust but also the part of denser
mantle below. They have an average thickness
of 100 km. They float on the plastic upper mantle
called “aesthenosphere” and carry the
continents and oceans on their back. The edges
of the plates are designed as boundaries and
margins, where movements occur.
<br>
Major plates of the world are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>American plate</li>
        <li>Pacific plate</li>
        <li>Antarctic plate</li>
        <li>African plate</li>
        <li>European plate</li>
        <li>Australian plate</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

Some minor plates are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Caribbean plate.</li>
        <li>Cocas plate</li>
        <li>Nazca plate</li>
        <li>Juan de Fuca plate</li>
        <li>Philippine plate, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


All these plates are in constant motion both
in relation to each other and with regard to the
earth’s motion. Some movements are responsible
for the volcanic activities, seismic and other plate
disturbances on the margins of the plates.
<br>
<br>
Types of movements of plates
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Convergence:</b> When the oceanic
lithosphere moves towards the continental
lithosphere, due to its thickness the continental
crust is unable to go down and it is the oceanic
crust which is involved in subduction. The
downwent plate of the oceanic crust melts and
produces magma. This magma rises
slowly and emerges as intrusive igneous rock in
the form of volcanic mountains on the
continental crust. Thus origin of volcanic
mountains like Andes takes place.
When the two oceanic lithospheres lie on
both side of subduction, then either of the two
plates may subduct. The subducted part melts
and the magma rises above the oceanic surface
and volcanic islands are formed in arc form like
Aleutian island, Kuril Island, Ryuku Island, etc.
When the continental lithosphere lies on
both sides of subduction, the sediments get
scrapped off the descending plate margin. In the
next stage the two continents collide, squeezing
the sediment mass and throwing it into
complicated fold and high alpine ranges like
Himalayas and Alps are formed.</li>
        <li><b>Divergence/continental rupturing:</b> It is
also termed as “ocean floor spreading”. Deep
beneath the continental plate a column of heated
mantle rock begins to rise and reach the plate
above, causing the plate to fracture, which is
called “continental rupture”. At first block
mountains are formed. Next a long narrow valley
called “rift valley” appears. The widening crack
in its center is continuously filled in with magma
rising from the mantle below. The magma
solidifies to form new crust and also a new
oceanic crust and lithosphere.</li>
        <li><b>Parallel movements of plates:</b> Parallel
plates, as they slide past each other along a
common boundary, do not create a new crust
or destroy the old one but they produce
“transform faults” which are fractures in rock
formation. Fractures imply displacement of
rocks. As the plates continue to move, the locked
rocks snap. They shift violently back to
equilibrium like a bent - stick breaking. This
violent shift causes earth - quakes.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
