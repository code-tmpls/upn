<h3>Weathering & Erosion</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Weathering</i></strong></div>

Weathering is the process of disintegration
and decomposition of rocks while erosion is the
process of removal, transportation and
deposition of the weathered particles. These
processes together are known as “Denudation.”
Weathering is defined as mechanical
disintegration and chemical decomposition of
rocks through the actions of various elements of
weather and climate. Weathering process brings
mechanical disintegration and chemical
decaying of rocks. Weather conditions are the
most decisive phenomenon hence the name
weathering. However the type and rate of
weathering are also influenced by rock structure,
topography and vegetation. Weathering is a
static process. It is also the process of soil genesis.
It is of three types:
<br>
<br>
<b>Mechanical Weathering:</b> When a region
undergoes mechanical weathering, rocks are
broken into small pieces. Physical or mechanical
weathering processes depend on some applied
forces. The applied forces could be: (i)
gravitational forces such as overburden pressure,
load and shearing stress; (ii) expansion forces
due to temperature changes, crystal growth or
animal activity; (iii) water pressures controlled
by wetting and drying cycles.
<br>
<br>
Many of these forces are applied both at the
surface and within different earth materials
leading to rock fracture. Most of the physical
weathering processes are caused by thermal
expansion and pressure release. These processes
are small and slow but can cause great damage
to the rocks because of continued fatigue the
rocks suffer due to repetition of contraction and
expansion.
<br>
<br>
This mechanical disintegration takes place in
different ways.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Frost Action: Frost weathering occurs due
to growth of ice within pores and cracks of
rocks during repeated cycles of freezing and
melting. This process is most effective at
high elevations in mid-latitudes where
freezing and melting is often repeated.
Glacial areas are subject to frost wedging
daily. In this process, the rate of freezing is
important. Rapid freezing of water causes
its sudden expansion and high pressure.
The resulting expansion affects joints, cracks
and small inter granular fractures to
become wider and wider till the rock breaks
apart.</li>
        <li>Thermal Expansion and Contraction:
Various minerals in rocks possess their own
limits of expansion and contraction. With
rise in temperature, every mineral expands
and pushes against its neighbour and as
temperature falls, a corresponding
contraction takes place. Because of diurnal
changes in the temperatures, this internal
movement among the mineral grains of the
superficial layers of rocks takes place
regularly. This process is most effective in
dry climates and high elevations where
diurnal temperature changes are drastic.
Though these movements are very small
they make the rocks weak due to continued
fatigue.
<br>
<br>
The surface layers of the rocks tend to
expand more than the rock at depth and
this leads to the formation of stress within
the rock resulting in heaving and fracturing
parallel to the surface. Due to differential
heating, the resulting expansion and
contraction of surface layers and their
subsequent exfoliation from the surface
results in smooth rounded surfaces of rocks.
In rocks like granites, smooth surfaced and
rounded small to big boulders called tors
form due to such exfoliation. In the area of
hot deserts, the diurnal range of
temperature brings the expansion and
contraction of surface rocks, leading to their
disintegration into smaller pieces.</li>
        <li>Exfoliation: This is the expansion by
unloading process. Unloading occurs when
large igneous bodies are exposed through
the erosional removal of overlying rock and
the reduction in the pressure. On being
exposed to the surface they expand slightly
in volume. This leads to the peeling of thick
shells like an onion’s layers from the parent
rock.</li>
        <li>Spalling: When there is a sudden shower
in the hot desert area, the highly heated
rocks when struck by sudden drizzle
develop numerous cracks.</li>
        <li>Cavernous Weathering: It occurs generally
in hot arid region and also in the rocks of
coastal area.</li>
        <li>Salt Weathering: Salts in rocks expand due
to thermal action, hydration and
crystallization. Many salts like calcium,
sodium, magnesium, potassium and barium
have a tendency to expand. Expansion of
these salts depends on temperature and
their thermal properties. High temperature
ranges between 30°C and 50°C of surface
temperatures in deserts favour such salt
expansion.
<br>
<br>
Salt crystals in near-surface pores cause
splitting of individual grains within rocks,
which eventually fall off. This process of
falling off of individual grains may result
in granular disintegration or granular
foliation.
<br>
<br>
Salt crystallization is most effective of all
salt-weathering processes. In areas with
alternating wetting and drying conditions
salt crystal growth is favoured and the
neighbouring grains are pushed aside.
Sodium chloride and gypsum crystals in
desert areas heave up overlying layers of
materials and with the result polygonal
cracks develop all over the heaved surface.
With salt crystal growth, chalk breaks down
most readily, followed by limestone,
sandstone, shale, gneiss and granite etc.</li>
        <li>Sheeting: The development of cracks and
fractures, parallel to the ground surface,
caused by removal of superincumbent load.</li>
        <li>Cambering process: Due to expansion
caused by unloading of super-incombitant
load and consequent release of confining
pressure.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<b>Flaking:</b> Different heating of outer and
lower shells of a rock mass causes flaking.
<br>
<br>
<b>Chemical Weathering:</b> It changes the basic
properties of the rock. Principal processes
of chemical weathering are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Solution: Here the rocks are completely
dissolved. This process involves removal of
solids in solution and depends upon
solubility of a mineral in water or weak
acids.
<br>
<br>
On coming in contact with water many
solids disintegrate and mix up as suspension
in water. Soluble rock forming minerals like
nitrates, sulphates and potassium etc. are
affected by this process. So, these minerals
are easily leached out without leaving any
residue in rainy climates and accumulate
in dry regions. Minerals like calcium
carbonate and calcium magnesium
bicarbonate present in limestones are
soluble in water containing carbonic acid
(formed with the addition of carbon dioxide
in water), and are carried away in water
as solution. Carbon dioxide produced by
decaying organic matter along with soil
water greatly aids in this reaction. Common
salt (sodium chloride) is also a rock forming
mineral and is susceptible to this process of
solution.</li>
        <li>Oxidation and Reduction: In weathering,
oxidation means a combination of a
mineral with oxygen to form oxides or
hydroxides. Oxidation occurs where there
is ready access to the atmosphere and
oxygenated waters. The minerals most
commonly involved in this process are iron,
manganese, sulphur etc. Though it is a
universal phenomenon but it is more
apparent in rocks containing iron.
In the process of oxidation rock breakdown
occurs due to the disturbance caused by
addition of oxygen. Red colour of iron upon
oxidation turns to brown or yellow. When
oxidized minerals are placed in an
environment where oxygen is absent,
reduction takes place. Such conditions exist
usually below the water table, in areas of
stagnant water and waterlogged ground.
Red colour of iron upon reduction turns to
greenish or bluish grey.</li>
        <li>Hydration: Hydration is the chemical
addition of water. Most of the rock-forming
minerals absorb water. Minerals take up
water and expand. This not only increases
their volume but also produces chemical
changes resulting in the formation of new
minerals which are softer and more
voluminous. E.g. this process converts
hematite into limonite. Calcium sulphate
takes in water and turns to gypsum, which
is more unstable than calcium sulphate.
This process is reversible and long,
continued repetition of this process causes
fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their
disintegration. Many clay minerals swell
and contract during wetting and drying
and a repetition of this process results in
cracking of overlying materials. Salts in pore
spaces undergo rapid and repeated
hydration and help in rock fracturing. The
volume changes in minerals due to
hydration will also help in physical
weathering through exfoliation and
granular disintegration.</li>
        <li>Carbonation: Carbonation is the reaction
of carbonate and bicarbonate with minerals
and is a common process helping the
breaking down of feldspars and carbonate
minerals. Carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere and soil air is absorbed by
water, to form carbonic acid that acts as a
weak acid. Calcium carbonates and
magnesium carbonates are dissolved in
carbonic acid and are removed in a solution
without leaving any residue resulting in
cave formation.</li>
        <li>Hydrolysis: The mineral of the rocks and
water molecules react in such a way that
new mineral compounds are formed.
Silicate minerals are most affected by
defrosts.</li>
        <li>Chelation: Chelation is a complex organic
process by hydrocarbon molecules.
Chelation is form of Chemical weathering
by plants.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These weathering processes are interrelated.
Hydration, carbonation and oxidation go
hand in hand and hasten the weathering
process.
<br>
<br>
<b>Biological Weathering:</b> This type of
weathering is performed by the tree roots,
animals and human beings. As the plant
roots grow, they wedge the rocks apart and
cause the widening of joints and other
fractures. Micro animals like earthworms,
ants, termites and other burrowing animals
move materials to or near the surface where
they are more closely subjected to chemical
weathering.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Erosion</i></strong></div>

Erosion is concerned with the various ways
in which the mobile agencies acquire and remove
rock debris. The acquisition of materials by the
mobile agencies and their transport, i.e. corrasion
and transportation are considered to be the
integral part of erosion. The principal erosional
agents are running water, groundwater, glaciers,
wind and coastal waves. Each of the agents does
erosion by distinctive processes and gives rise to
distinctive landforms. There are five common
aspects of erosion by the above mentioned
agents.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The acquisition of rocks fragments.</li>
        <li>Wearing away of rocks fragments.</li>
        <li>The breaking down of the rock particles by
mutual wear while in transit.</li>
        <li>Transportation of the acquired rock debris.</li>
        <li>Ultimately the deposition in the low lying
areas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mass Wasting</i></strong></div>

Mass wasting is the movement of material
down a slope under the influence of gravity. It
is a transitional phenomenon between
weathering and erosion. Mass Wasting is of
Various Types: Land-slide, Debris avalanche,
Earth-flow, Mud-flow, and Sheet-flow etc.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Soil creep: In soil covered slope extremely
slow downslope movement of soil and over
burden may be found. This process is called
as soil creep.</li>
        <li>Talus cones: Steep rocks walls of gorges
and high mountains shed countless rock
particles under the attack of physical
weathering processes.</li>
        <li>Earth Flows: In humid climate region, if
slope are steep, masses of water-saturated
soil due to over burden or weak bedrock
may side down slope during a period of
few hours.</li>
        <li>Mud flow: Rapid flowage of mud stream
down a canyon floor and spreading out on
plain at the foot of a mountain range is
called as mud flow.</li>
        <li>Landslide: The downslope movement of
regolith of bed rock is called as landslide.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
