<h3>Atmosphere</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Composition of Atmosphere</i></strong></div>

The atmosphere, a mixture of many gases,
contains huge amount of solid and liquid
particles, collectively known as “aerosols”. Pure
dry air consists mainly of Nitrogen (78%),
Oxygen (21%), Argon (0.93%), Carbon dioxide
(0.03%), Hydrogen, Helium and Ozone. Besides,
water vapour, dust particles, smoke, salts are also
present in air in varying quantities. As a result,
the composition of air is never constant and
varies from time to time and place to place.
Some of the gases behave like permanent
atmospheric components as they remain in fix
proportion of the total gas volume. Two gases,
nitrogen and oxygen constitute about 99% of the
clean dry air. The deep layer through which the
gaseous composition of the atmosphere is
generally homogeneous is called the
“homosphere”. At higher altitude, the chemical
constituents of air changes considerably and this
layer is known as “heterosphere”.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Structure of the Atmosphere</i></strong></div>

The atmosphere consists of almost concentric
layers of air with varying density and
temperature. Density is highest on the earth’s
surface and goes on decreasing upwards.
The atmosphere can be divided into following
layers:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Troposphere:</i></strong></div>    
        
The lowest layer of the atmosphere extending
to an average altitude of 10 km, varying between
18 km above the equator and 8 km above poles.
It is a region of clouds, water vapour and
weather. Troposphere literally means the region
of mixing. It contains about 75 percent of the
total mass of the atmosphere and practically all
the moisture and dust particles.
Temperature decreases at the rate of 6°C per
km of height above Sea level. The temperature
at the end of the troposphere is around -80°C.
The boundary line separating troposphere from
stratosphere is known as Tropopause.
Stratosphere: The region above the
tropopause extending up to 50 km above the
earth is known as Stratosphere. Temperature
ceases to fall with the increase in height at this
level. The temperature at tropopause is about -
80°C over the equator and about - 45°C over the
poles.
<br>
<br>
In the lower part of the stratosphere i.e.
upto height of 20 km, temperature remains
constant. Afterwards it gradually increases upto
a height of 50 km because of the presence of
ozone layer. Clouds are almost absent and there
is little dust or water vapour. The air movements
are almost horizontal. The Stratospheric layer
provides ideal conditions for flying large
aeroplanes. Cirrus clouds, called the “mother of
pearl clouds”, occasionally form in the lower
stratosphere. Above the tropopause no visible
weather phenomena ever occur. The upper
boundary of the stratosphere is called
“Stratopause”.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mesosphere:</i></strong></div>    
        
It exists over the stratosphere extending upto
a height of about 80 km above the earth.
Temperature sharply decreases with height and
reaches the lowest level of -100°C at the top. Bulk
of the meteors is destroyed in this region. Because
of the preponderance of chemical processes this
sphere is sometimes called the ‘Chemosphere’.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i> Ionosphere:</i></strong></div>    
       
It is located between 80 and 400 km. It is an
electrically charged layer. Radio waves
transmitted from the earth are reflected back by
this layer. Temperature again starts increasing
with the height because of radiation from the
Sun. At this level, the ionization of atmosphere
begins to occur. This layer was first of all
discovered by Kennelly and Heaviside.
Layers of Ionosphere:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>D-Layer: It is the lowest layer of
Ionosphere (60 km to 90 km). It reflects
low-frequency radio waves but absorbs
medium and high frequency waves. It
disappears as soon as the sun sets.</li>
        <li>E-Layer: It extends from 90 km to 120 km
and called as “Kennelly-Heaviside layer”.
It reflects the medium and high frequency
radio waves. This layer also does not exist
at night.</li>
        <li>F-Layer: The F layer, also known as the
Appleton layer extends from about 200
km to more than 500 km above the surface
of Earth. This layer is important in long
distance radio communication. It reflects
the medium and high frequency radio
waves.</li>
        <li>G-Layer: This is the uppermost part of
Ionosphere. Because of the interaction of
ultraviolet photons with nitrogen atoms,
free electrons are produced in this layer.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 </li>
        <li>Exosphere/Thermosphere:
It is the uppermost layer of the atmosphere
extending beyond the ionosphere above a height
of 400 kilometres. This layer is extremely rarified
and gradually merges with the outer space.
Hydrogen and helium gases dominate this
region. Here the temperature may reach a high
value of about 5568°C.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Insolation/ Solar Radiation</i></strong></div>

Incoming solar radiation is known as
Isolation and it is received in the form of short
waves. The earth’s surface receives the radiant
energy at the rate of 2 calories per sq. cm. per
minute.
<br>
<br>
Factors effecting the distribution of Insolation:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Distance between Earth & Sun: The
average distance between these two bodies
is about 149 million km. On January 3 the
earth comes closer to the sun, called
“perihelion”. On July 4, the earth is little
farther from the sun and this position is
called ‘aphelion’. Hence the amount of
incoming solar radiation is about 7 percent
more in January.</li>
        <li>Angle of Incidence: The oblique rays have
to travel longer distance through the
atmosphere before they strike the surface
of the earth and large amount of energy is
lost by various processes of reflection,
absorption, scattering, etc. At mid-day the
intensity of insolation is maximum. In
winter and high latitudes the insolation
received is small.</li>
        <li>Duration of Sunshine: The most important
causes for the variation in the amount of
solar energy reaching the earth are the
seasonal changes in the angle at which the
sun’s rays strike the surface and the length
of the day.
Summer Solstice: 21st June
Winter Solstice: 22nd December
Autumnal Equinox: 23rd September
Spring Equinox: 21st March.</li>
        <li>Solar Constant: When the sun-spots appear
in larger number, the intensity of the solar
radiation received is increased. The number
of sunspot changes on a regular basis in a
cycle of 11 years.</li>
        <li>Transparency of Atmosphere: Reflection
from dust, salt, smoke particles, etc returns
short wave radiation to space. Similarly
cloud tops deplete the amount of insolation.
Transparency of the atmosphere is closely
related to the latitudes. In the higher
latitudes the sun’s ray are more oblique. In
winter when the altitude of the sun is
relatively lower, there is greater loss of
incoming solar radiation than in summer.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Heat Budget</i></strong></div>

The average temperature of the earth
remains rather constant. It has been possible
because of the balance between the amount of
incoming solar radiation and the amount of
terrestrial radiation returned to space. This
balance of incoming and outgoing radiation has
been termed as the earth’s heat budget.
Let us assume that the total heat received at
the top of the atmosphere is 100 units. About 35
units are reflected back to space even before
reaching the earth’s surface. Of these, 27 units
are reflected back from the top of the clouds and
2 units from the snow and ice-covered areas of
the earth. The reflected amount of radiation is
called the Albedo of Earth.
<br>
<br>
The remaining 65 units are absorbed, 14
units within the atmosphere and 51 units by the
earth’s surface. The earth radiates back 51 units
in the form of terrestrial radiation. Of these, 17
units are radiated to space directly and the
remaining 34 units are absorbed by the
atmosphere - 6 units absorbed directly by the
atmosphere, 9 units through convection and
turbulence and 19 units through latent heat of
condensation. About 48 units absorbed by the
atmosphere (14 units from insolation and 34
units from terrestrial radiation) and also radiated
back into the space. Thus the total radiation
returning from the earth and the atmosphere
respectively is 17 + 48 = 65 units which balance
the total of 65 units received from the sun. Hence
the heat balance of the earth is always
maintained.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mechanism of Heat Transfer</i></strong></div>

There are certain processes which play
significant role in the transfer of energy from the
earth surface to its atmosphere. The atmosphere
is heated and cooled by the following processes:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Absorption by Atmosphere: About 14
percent of insolation is directly absorbed
by dust particles and water vapour. Nearly
50 percent of this absorption occurs in the
lower 2 km of air.</li>
        <li>Conduction: When two bodies of unequal
temperature are in contact with one
another, there is a flow of energy from the
warmer to the cooler body, until both the
bodies attain the same temperature. Since
air is very poor conductor of heat, it affects
only the lowermost layer of the air. It is
least important in the heat transfer for the
atmosphere as a whole.</li>
        <li>Terrestrial Radiation: Radiant solar energy
reaches the earth’s surface in the form of
short electro-magnetic waves but is radiated
in the form of long waves or infrared
radiation. Gases and water vapour are
almost transparent to short wave radiation.
Thus atmosphere receives a larger part of
its energy supply from the earth and not
directly from the sun.</li>
        <li>Convection & Advection: Heat gained by
the layers of air at or near the earth’s surface
from radiation or conduction is transferred
to the upper atmospheric layers by the
process of convection. Whereas the term
convection is used for vertical motion in
the atmosphere, the term advection is used
for horizontal transport of heat. Advection
is responsible for slow heat transfer from
the equatorial to the polar regions. “Loo”
is the example of advection.</li>
        <li>Latent Heat of Condensation: Half of the
insolation received at the ocean surface is
consumed in the evaporation of surface
water. When the water vapour is
condensed, the latent heat is again released
into the atmosphere and is used in heating
it.</li>
        <li>Expansion and Compression of Air:
Whenever air moves upward it passes
through region of successively lower
pressure and whenever descends the viceversa. Rising air expands and cools
adiabatically. The descending air is
compressed and heated. Thus the
temperature changes brought about in the
air aloft simply due to changes in the air
pressure are very important in the heating
or cooling of the atmosphere.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Factors Influencing Temperature</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Latitude: In general the temperature
decreases from the equator to the poles as
per the altitude of the mid-day sun.</li>
        <li>Altitude: Temperature falls by 6.5° C for
every 1 km ascent.</li>
        <li>Ocean Currents: Warm ocean currents,
moving polewards, carry tropical warmth
into the high latitude. This warming
influence is very marked in latitudes 40° to
65° on the west side of the continents,
especially along the sea-board of Western
Europe. Cold currents have fewer effects
upon temperature because they usually lie
under offshore winds. However, there are
some exceptions e.g. the coast of Labrador,
where the summer temperatures are
lowered by on shore winds which blow
over the cold Labrador current.</li>
        <li>Distance from Sea: The sun’s heat is
absorbed and released more slowly by
water than by the land. So the sea-adjoining
areas experience warming and cooling
effects. The climatic regions whose
temperatures are influenced greatly by the
sea are called “maritime or oceanic or
insular climate”. Climate whose
temperature is greatly influenced by the
remoteness from the sea are called
“continental climate”</li>
        <li>Winds: In temperate latitudes, prevailing
winds from the land lower the winter
temperature but raise the summer
temperature and the prevailing winds from
the sea raise the winter temperature but
lower the summer temperature. In tropical
latitudes, on-shore winds modify the
temperature of the coastal regions. Local
winds sometimes produce rapid upward
or downward changes in the temperature.</li>
        <li>Cloud Cover and Humidity: Clouds reduce
the amount of solar radiation reaching the
earth’s surface and the amount of earth
radiation leaving the earth’s surface. The
heavy cloud cover of equatorial regions
doesn’t allow a day temperature over 30°C.
In hot desert the absence of clouds results
in very high day temperature of over 38°C
and clear sky allows the earth heat to escape
freely resulting in fall of temperature up to
20°C at night.</li>
        <li>Aspects: South facing slopes are warmer
than north-facing slopes in the Northern
Hemisphere while in the Southern
Hemisphere the reverse is true. In the high
latitude the mid-day sun is at a low angle
in winter and hence blocks of flats are
usually built far apart to enable all the flats
to receive some sunshine.</li>
        <li>Length of Day: The length of day also
influences the temperature.</li>
        <li>Amount of Dust and Other Impurities in
the Air: In the industrial areas and large
urban centres, the polluted particles are
abundant in the air. These particles not only
absorb larger amount of insolation but also
greatly absorb the terrestrial radiation.
Hence these areas show larger temperature
than the surrounding areas and are
converted into “Heat Islands”.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Between January and July all the isotherms
in the northern hemisphere move northward.
This movement of isotherm is greater over the
land than over the oceans. The highest
temperatures for both January and July are over
the continents. The isotherms bend poleward
over the ocean but equatorward over the
continent in January. The isotherms bend
equatorward over the ocean but poleward over
the continents in July.
<br>
<br>
The seasonal changes are less marked over
the southern continents than over the northern
ones. The range of temperature increases from
the equator to the poles. The coastal regions have
a smaller range of temperature than the
continental interiors. The range of temperature
on the eastern sides of Asia and North America
is greater than on the Western side in the same
latitude.
<br>
<br>
Temperature Anomaly: Temperature varies
even along the same parallel of latitude because
of the factors like altitude, land and water
contrasts, prevailing winds and ocean currents.
The difference between the mean temperature
of any place and the mean temperature of its
parallel is called the Temperature Anomaly or
Thermal Anomaly. It therefore, expresses
deviation from the normal.
<br>
<br>
Inversion of Temperature: Air temperature
also varies according to the altitude. At higher
altitudes air becomes less dense; it is unable to
absorb heat, resulting in colder air temperature.
The normal drop of temperature with height is
known as normal lapse rate which is 6.4°C per
km on an average. Temperature inversion is the
situation where there is increase in temperature
with height before beginning to drop into the
normal lapse rate. In cases where the
temperature remains the same with increase of
altitude, the layer of atmosphere is called
Isothermal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Humidity</i></strong></div>

It refers to the content of water vapour
present in air in gaseous form at a particular time
and place. It is measured through an instrument
called ‘hygrometer.’
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute Humidity: The total weight of
moisture content or water vapour per
volume of air at definite temperature is
called absolute humidity.</li>
        <li>Specific Humidity: It is defined as the
mass of water vapour in grams contained in a kilogram of air and it represents the actual quantity of moisture
present in a definite air.</li>
        <li>Relative Humidity: It is defined as a
ratio of the amount of water vapour
actually present in the air having definite volume and temperature (i.e. absolute humidity) to the maximum amount
the air can hold at that temperature (i.e.
humidity capacity).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Dew point:</b> It is the temperature at which a
parcel of air would have to be cooled in order to
reach saturation. The favourable conditions are
moist air, light winds and clear night skies to
ensure maximum cooling by radiation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Evaporation:</i></strong></div>

Evaporation can be defined as the process
by which liquid water is converted into a gaseous
state. Evaporation can only occur when water
is available. It also requires that the humidity of
the atmosphere be less than the evaporating
surface (at 100% relative humidity there is no
more evaporation). The evaporation process
requires large amounts of energy. For example,
the evaporation of one gram of water at a
temperature of 100° Celsius requires 540 calories
of heat energy (600 calories at 0° Celsius).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Condensation:</i></strong></div>

In this process the water vapour is changed
into liquid state. If air is cooled below its dew
point, some of air’s water vapour becomes liquid.
Thus any further cooling of saturated air starts
the process of condensation. Condensation
depends upon two factors - relative humidity of
air and degree of cooling.
Necessary conditions for condensation are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The air must be saturated. Saturation
occurs either when the air is cooled below
the dew point or when vapour is added to
the air.</li>
        <li>There must be a surface on which the water
vapour may condense. For dew or frost,
solid objects at the ground do this work.
But when the condensation occurs in the
air, the surface is provided by the dust
particles or aerosols and these particles are
known as “hygroscopic nuclei”.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Condensation in Atmosphere:</b> The cooling
needed to produce condensation can occur in a
number of ways:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Relatively warm moist air moving over a
colder surface.</li>
        <li>The mixing of warm, moist unsaturated air
with colder unsaturated air.</li>
        <li>Radiative cooling from the land surface.</li>
        <li>Upward motion of air.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Condensation Nuclei:</b> The particles which
serve as condensation nuclei are hygroscopic,
that is, they have affinity for water.
Adiabatic Lapse Rate: The rate at which
temperature decreases in rising and expanding
as parcel is known as the adiabatic lapse rate.
Until condensation occurs, temperature fall at
the rate of about 9.8°C per/km. This is known
as dry adiabatic lapse.
<br>
<br>
<b>Fog:</b>It is microscopically small drops of
condensed water suspended in the air near the
earth surface in sufficient number. It reduces the
horizontal visibility to less than 1 km. For aviation
purpose the reporting of fog is done only when
the visibility is less than 9 km. On the basis of
appearance the fogs may be classified as1. Smog: It is formed in the polluted air of
large industrial centres having large
number of soot and dust particles, generally
dirty and mixed with smoke.
<br>
<b> Haze:</b> It limits the visibility between 2 km
and 5 km.
<br>
<b>Mist:</b> It is intermediate between fog and
haze (visibility between 1 and 2 km).
<br>
<b>Smaze:</b> It is an admixture of smoke and
haze.
<br>
<b>Frost-Smoke:</b> It is formed in the Arctic
region when the air temperature falls much
below the freezing point. It is kind of fog
having innumerable ice particles and supercooled water droplets is formed by the
process of condensation. It generally takes
place on the surface of water bodies and
later carried over the land by winds.
<br>
<b>Zero Visibility:</b> When the object cannot be
seen easily beyond 25 m.
‘9’ Visibility: When the object can be seen
easily upto 50 km


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Clouds</i></strong></div>

Clouds are aggregates of innumerable tiny
water droplets, ice particles or mixture of both
in air generally above ground surface. On the
basis of height clouds are classified as under:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>High Clouds (mean height 6 to 13 km):</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Cirrus: Detached clouds; fibrous (hair like)
silky appearance composed of ice crystals;
do not give precipitation.</li>
        <li>Cirro-cumulus: Thin, white patch; sheet or
layer of cloud; often connected with cirrus
or cirro-stratus clouds; when arranged
uniformly it forms a “mackerel sky”.</li>
        <li>Cirro-stratus: Transparent, whitish cloud
of fibrous or smooth appearance; produces
“halo” phenomena around the sun and
moon; mainly formed of ice-crystals.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>Middle Clouds (mean height 2 to 6 km.):</b>
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Alto-cumulus: Do not produce “halos”;
have dark shading on their under surface;
also referred as “sheep clouds”; composed
of super-cooled liquid droplets.</li>
                <li>Alto-stratus: The sun may be totally
obscured but “halos” are never seen;
shadow on the ground is never cast;
precipitation may fall either as fine drizzle
or snow.</li>
                <li>Nimbo-stratus: A low cloud form and
may be thousands of feet thick; it is a rain,
snow or sleet cloud; never accompanied by
lightening, thunder or hail.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </li>
        <li><b>Low Clouds (mean height 0 to 2 km):</b>
        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>Strato-cumulus: A low cloud layer
consisting of large lumpy masses or rolls of
dull grey colour with brighter interstices.</li>
                <li>Stratus: A fairly uniform base which may
give drizzle, ice-prisms or snow grains; sky
may be completely covered by this cloud;
difficult to differentiate between high fog
and stratus.</li>
                <li>Cumulus: Detached dense clouds with
sharp outlines; develop vertically in the
form of rising mounds; generally found in
the day time over land areas; they dissipate
at night.</li>
                <li>Cumulo-nimbus: Heavy and dense cloud
in the form of anvil; they are associated
with heavy rainfall, thunder, lightning and
hail; have flat top and a flat base; it
obstructs the sun.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Precipitation</i></strong></div>

It is the process by which condensed water
vapour falls to the earth’s surface as rainfall,
snowfall and other forms. On the basis of its
origin, precipitation may be classified into three
main types:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Convectional Precipitation: It is caused
when moist winds are drawn into the
convection currents of a hot region. It
generally occurs in equatorial region. The
thundery rain of a summer afternoon is a
typical example.</li>
        <li>Orographic Precipitation: It is caused by
the surface relief of the land, mainly, by
the presence of mountain range. There is
heavy rain on the windward side.
Cyclonic Precipitation: It is associated with
the passage of a cyclone or depression.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Forms of Precipitation</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Rain: Of liquid water particles in the form
of drops of more than 0.5 mm dia.</li>
        <li>Drizzle: Fine drops of water (diameter less
than 0.5 mm), very close to one another.</li>
        <li>Snow: White and opaque grains of ice.</li>
        <li>Sleet: Mixture of rain and snow</li>
        <li>Hail: small pieces of ice with a diameter
ranging from 5 to 50 mm.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rainfall</i></strong></div>

When precipitation is in the form of water
drops, we call it rainfall. Only when
temperature of water vapour is above 0°C,
rainfall will occur. At sub-zero level
temperatures, snowfall will occur. Main
determinants of rainfall are- latitude, distance
from the sea, direction of winds, proximity of
mountains and seasons. The regions of heavy
rainfall in the world are - Equatorial regions,
Tropical Monsoon regions and mid-latitude West
Margin regions. Regions of low rainfall (below
25 cm annual) are- tropical desert, mid-latitude
deserts and Polar Regions.
<br>
<br>
<b>World Distribution of rainfall:</b> After
examining the latitudinal pattern of distribution
of rainfall it will be seen that the maximum is
received in the equatorial zone and the minimum
is in the Polar Regions. A secondary maximum
lies in the belt of 40°–60° N and 40°–60° S and a
secondary minimum occurs around 30° N and
30° S latitudes. This pattern of rainfall
distribution is closely related to the distribution
of major pressure belts of the world. The two
zones of maximum precipitation are related to
the equatorial low pressure and sub-polar low
pressure. These low pressure belts are regions of
ascending air and therefore precipitation is
greater than elsewhere. The belts of minimum
precipitation are zones of polar high pressure
and subtropical high pressure. As the capacity
to hold water vapour decreases sharply with
temperature, precipitation is generally higher in
the low latitudes than in the high latitudes.
This broad latitudinal pattern is modified by
the distribution of continents and oceans, and
the direction of prevailing winds. Winds blowing
from the oceans towards the landmasses are
called on shore winds. Such winds are moisture
laden and give rainfall along the coast. When
winds blow from the land masses towards the
oceans, they are called off-shore winds. These
are not rain bearing winds.
<br>
<br>
In the belt of trade winds, there is maximum
precipitation in the eastern margins of continents
as the easterly winds blow from the oceans. In
this belt rainfall decreases towards the west. The
western margins of continents are deserts. These
are the tropical deserts of the world.
In the mid-latitudes, the westerly winds give
maximum “rainfall to the western margins of
continents. Rainfall decreases gradually towards
the east and the interiors of large continents are
dry. These are mid-latitude deserts.
The location of mountain ranges with
reference to prevailing winds also influences the
distribution of precipitation. Maximum
precipitation is received where the mountain
ranges lie right across the path of prevailing
winds e.g. the Western Ghats in India.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The regions of heavy precipitation (more
than 150 cm):
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Equatorial regions: The Amazon and the
Congo basins, Malaysia, Indonesia and New
Guinea.</li>
        <li>Tropical Monsoon regions: Parts of India,
South-east Asia and South China.</li>
        <li>Mid-latitude West Margin regions: Coastal
regions of British Columbia, North-west
Europe, South Chile and South Island of
New Zealand.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Moderate rainfall of 100 to 150 cm per
year is received in the eastern margins of
continents in the trade-wind belt. These are
the sub-tropical eastern margins of China,
the U.S.A., Brazil, South Africa and
Australia.</li>
        <li>Regions of extremely low rainfall (less
than 25 cm.):
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tropical deserts Western margins of
continents in the trade wind belt–
Californian desert in the United States,
Atacama, Kalahari, southern Africa,
Sahara, Arabia and then in Afro Asia, and
West Australia.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pressure & Wind</i></strong></div>

Wind can be defined as air in motion. The
principal cause of winds is the difference in
pressure. Air always moves from areas of high
pressure to those with low pressure. The slope
of the pressure from high to low is known as the
pressure gradient and the direction of this
gradient decides the direction of the winds.
Owing to the earth’s rotation, all the winds
are deflected to the right in the northern
hemisphere and to the left in the southern
hemisphere. This is referred to as the Ferrel’s Law
and the force occuring due to the rotation of the
earth is called the Coriolis force.
Buys Ballot’s Law: In northern hemisphere,
if a person stands with his back to the wind, low
pressure lies to his left and high pressure lies to
his right. In S-Hemisphere it is reversed since the
Coriolis deflection is to his left.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Types of winds:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Planetary winds or Prevailing winds; Trade
winds, Westerlies and Easterlies.</li>
        <li>Periodic winds: Land breeze, Sea breeze &
Monsoon winds.</li>
        <li>Local winds: Loo, Fohn, Chinook, Mistral
and Jet Streams.</li>
        <li>Atmospheric Disturbances: Tropical
Cyclones and Temperate Cyclones.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Planetary Winds:</b> The wind systems that
are bound to occur at the global level on any
planet having an atmosphere and rotating about
its axis. The specific characteristics of trade
winds, Westerlies and Easterlies may be
determined by several conditions but the broad
features are constant over the globe.
<br>
<b>Trade Winds:</b> These winds blow from the
subtropical high pressure towards the equatorial
region of low pressure regularly throughout the
year. It brings little rain except on the line of
convergence of the two trade wind systems.
<br>
<b>Westerlies:</b> The Westerly winds are those
which blow with great frequency from the Horse
latitudes towards the Polar region throughout
the year with varying intensity and cause rain
near the polar regions. Westerlies are stronger
in the Southern Hemisphere because of the vast
expanse of ocean waters. Owing to their
ferocious nature, they are also described as
“Roaring Forties”, “Furious Fifties” and
“Shrieking Sixties” in southern hemisphere.
<br>
<b>Doldrums:</b> Also known as Intertropical
convergence, it is the equatorial belt of low
atmospheric pressure where the north-east and
south east Trade winds converge. It is a region
of calmness, the calm periodically broken by
storms, accompanied by heavy rains.
<br>
<b>Horse Latitude:</b> They are the subtropical
belts of high atmospheric pressure over the
oceans (near 30° latitude) between the regions
of trade winds and Westerlies. They are regions
of calm, light variable winds and dry air.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Periodic Winds:</i></strong></div>    
        
<b>Monsoon:</b> The word monsoon has been
derived from the Arabic word “Mausim” which
means season. The monsoon winds thus refer to
the wind systems that have a pronounced
seasonal reversal of direction. The monsoon
winds blow over India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Burma, Sri Lanka, Arabian sea, Bay of Bengal,
S.E. Asia, N. Australia, China and Japan.
<br>
<b>Summer Monsoon:</b> During summer, a
thermal low is developed over southern Asia in
the lower levels of the atmosphere. From the
Indian Ocean and the south western Pacific,
warm humid air moves northward and north
westward into Asia passing over India, Indo
China and China. This summer monsoon is
accompanied by heavy rainfall in south-east
Asia.
<br>
<b>Winter Monsoon:</b> The Winter monsoon is a
gentle drift of air in which the winds generally
blow from the north east. Retreating monsoon
causes sporadic rainfall especially in the northeastern parts and Tamil Nadu coastal areas of
India. Outside India, in the East Asian countries
e.g. China and Japan, the winter monsoon is
stronger than the summer monsoon.</li>
        <li>Local Winds: There are winds that
develop as a result of local conditions in
temperature and pressure of air. They affect
small areas in the lowest levels of Troposphere.
<br>
Loo: A very hot and dry wind (hot wave) in
the North Western India and Pakistan which
blows from the west in the afternoon of May and
June and may cause sunstroke.
<br>
Chinook and Fohn: Warm and dry local
winds, also called ‘snow-eater’, blow on the
leeward sides of the mountains. These are called
Chinook in the USA and Fohn in Switzerland.
<br>
Harmattan: The warm and dry winds
blowing from north-east and east to west in the
eastern parts of Sahara desert are called
Harmattan. Similar winds are called ‘brick
fielder’ in Australia, ‘blackroller’ in USA,
‘Shamal’ in Mesopotamia and Persian Gulf and
‘Norwesters’ in Newzealand.
<br>
Sirrocco: It is a warm, dry and dusty wind
which blows in northward direction from
Sahara desert and after crossing Mediterranean
Sea reaches Italy, Spain etc. Similar winds are
known as ‘Khamsin’ in Egypt, ‘Gibli’ in Libya,
‘Chilli’ in Tunisia, and ‘Simoom’ in Arabia.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Diurnal Variation in
Atmospheric Circulation</i></strong></div>

Diurnal wind systems occur frequently in
many tropical areas. They also occur in other
areas but rather irregularly and less frequently.
There are two major types of diurnal wind
systems:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Land and Sea Breezes: These occur along
the coast or near large water bodies. They
are caused by the thermal differences
between the land and water surface.
<br>
Sea Breeze: Takes place during the day
when a local thermal low develops over the land
with the winds blowing from the sea towards
the land.
<br>
Land Breeze: Take place during the night
when the land cools off rapidly while the sea is
still warm. Then the winds blow from the land
towards the sea.</li>
        <li>Mountain (Katabatic) and Valley
(Anabatic) Winds: During the day when
insolation is intense the more exposed hill
slopes are heated more than the valley
bottoms. Thus winds blow upward from
the valley. These are valley or anabatic
(upslope) winds. The high lands cool off
rather rapidly because of terrestrial
radiation losses. Cold and dense air then
drains downslope into valleys. Such cold
winds are known as mountain or Katabatic
winds.</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cyclones</i></strong></div>

This is a depression in a mass of air whose
isobars form an oval or circular shape with low
pressure at the centre. The air converges at the
centre and then rises. The winds rotate anti-clock
wise in the northern hemisphere while in the
southern hemisphere the circular movement of
winds is in a clockwise direction. Moving
cyclones are of three types:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Extratropical Cyclones:
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typical of middle and high latitudes;
usually called a depression.</li>
                    <li>This cyclone varies in diameter from 200
km to 300 km.</li>
                    <li>Appearance may be circular or elongated
or may be broad shallow, week depressions.</li>
                    <li>Usually travel in groups or “Families” from
the West to East.</li>
                    <li>Average speed is about 30-50 km per hour.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
</li>
        <li>Tropical Cyclones:
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tropical Cyclones are found in low
latitudes over oceans.</li>
                    <li>It is almost circular centre of extremely low
pressure into which winds spiral.</li>
                    <li>The diameter of the storm ranges from 160
to 650 km and the velocity of the wind
varies from a minimum of about 120 to
200 km per hour.</li>
                    <li>The life span of a tropical cyclone is about
a week and the storm travels at the rate of
15-30 km per hour.</li>
                    <li>Tropical cyclones are characterized by
violent winds and heavy rains.</li>
                    <li>The source of energy for the maintenance
of tropical cyclones is the latent heat of
condensation.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
</li>
        <li>Tornadoes:
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>The most violent storms of lower
troposphere.</li>
                    <li>The funnel shape cloud extends
downwards from the base of cumulonimbus
cloud layer.</li>
                    <li>Tornadoes which occur in conjunction with
scattered thunderstorms are usually shortlived and have irregular paths.</li>
                    <li>The circulation of wind is usually in a
counter clock wise direction; wind velocities
are very high almost about 100 m/sec.</li>
                    <li>Occur frequently east of the Rockies
Mountains in the Mississippi Basin in USA,
in eastern India and east of the Andes
Mountain.</li>
                    <li>At sea, tornadoes become water spouts
having same characteristic except that they
are small in diameter.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Anti-cyclones</i></strong></div>

It is opposite to the cyclones where two types
of anticyclones are observed:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Relatively Stationary, also called as warm
anticyclones.</li>
        <li>Travelling anticyclones, which are also
called as cold anticyclones, are mainly
found in the high latitude within
continental polar air.</li>
        <li>Barometric pressure is highest at its centre
and decreases outward. Anticyclonic wind
system blows out from the centre and
because of the Coriolis Effect it has a
clockwise circulation in the Northern
hemisphere and counter clockwise in
Southern hemisphere.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
