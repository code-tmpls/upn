<h3>Climatic Classification</h3>


Climate can be classified on the basis of
temperature, precipitation, evaporation and
their seasonal characteristics. The classification
scheme of W. Koppen is the most popular system
and universally accepted. A classification of the
world climatic types is given ahead:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tropical Rain Forest/Equatorial Forest Type
Extent: 5°N to 5°S; Amazon Basin, Zaire
Basin, Malaysia, Indonesia.
<br>
Average daily temperature: 25°C
throughout the year
Annual range of temperature: Less than
5°C
<br>
Daily range of temperature: Less than
10°c, due to high % of cloudiness.
Rainfall: Convectional, throughout the
year. No dry season.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 150 to 200 cm.
Characteristics: Hot wet condition
throughout the year favours rich
vegetation.</li>
        <li>Tropical Grassland/Savanna Type
Extent: 5°N to 15°N & 5°S to 15°S; Africa,
East & central S. America, Transitional
zone between Monsoon and desert climates
of Australia.
<br>
Monthly mean temperature: 32°C in
summer and 20°C in winter.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 50 to 100 cm.
<br>
Characteristics: Distinct dry season in
winter. Rainfall is in summer owing to
convectional ascent of air.
They have tropical grassland with
scattered trees.
<br>
Llanos: Colombian Highland.
<br>
Campos: SE highland of Brazil,
<br>
Granchaco: Argentina & Uruguay.
<br>
Savanna: Australia and Africa.</li>
        <li>Tropical Monsoon Type
Extent: South-east and East Asia, N.
Australia, India, Myanmar, Thailand and
South China.
<br>
<br>
Annual range of temperature is greater in
the interior than along the coast.
Annual rainfall may exceed 150 cm. along
the coast
<br>
Characteristics: Strongly developed dry
season and the rainfall of the driest mouth
is less than 6 cm. Great contrast in
temperature between summer and winter.</li>
        <li>Tropical Deserts
Extent: Western margin of the continent;
N. America- Colorado Desert, Mexican
Desert; Africa - Sahara & Kalahari Desert;
S.W.- Asia - Arabian, Iranian & Thar
Deserts; S. America- Atacama Desert;
Australia- Great Australian Desert.
Mean monthly temperature is 36°C in
summer and 15°C in winter.
Diurnal range of temperature is very high.
<br>
Annual rainfall: It is a region of
descending air so precipitation is scanty. It
remains very hot during the day (45°C) and
quite cool at night (15°C). Annual rainfall
is less than 20 cm.</li>
        <li>Mid-Latitude/Temperate Deserts
Extent: Tibet, Mongolia, Gobi, Patagonia,
Parts of Soviet, Central CIS.
Average annual temperature: above 18°C
<br>
Rainfall: scanty.
<br>
Charactereristic: Winter is colder because
of its interior location. Some are intermountain deserts.</li>
        <li>Tropical Dry-hot Steppe
Extent: N.Australia, Arabia, Rajasthan,
Deccan Plateau, S.African Plateau, North
Argentina.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 30 cm, maximum in
summer.
Charactereristic:Climate is semi-arid
characterized by grasslands.</li>
        <li>Mid-Latitude Dry-cold Steppe
Extent: Ukraine W. Siberia, Western U.S.A
Annual rainfall: less than 30 cm, maximum
in summer.
<br>
Charactereristic:It has semi-arid climate
with grasslands.</li>
        <li>Mild Humid Climate with no Dry Season/
West European Type
Extent: South of 45°S, Western margin
between 45°N and 60°N; N.W.-Europe
including British Isles, west coast of
Canada, S.Chile, Southern New Zealand,
Tasmania.
<br>
Rainfall of driest month: more than 3 cm.
Monthly mean temperature: 5°C in winter
and 15°C in summer.
<br>
Annual range of temperature: 10°C.
Winters are milder than the similar latitude
in the eastern margin of the continent.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 75 to 100 cm. No dry
Season as the westerly winds blow from
the ocean throughout the year. Rainfall is
mostly of cyclonic origin.</li>
        <li>Mild-Humid Climate with a Dry Winter/
China Type
<br>
Extent: Along the eastern margin of the
continent in sub-tropical belt; 25°-35° in
both the hemispheres; Central China, S.E.-
USA, South Bengal; Eastern Argentina,
S.E.-Africa, S.E.-Australia, S-Brazil, S-Japan.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 100 cm, maximum in
summer. Warmest summer month has ten
times more rainfall than the driest winter
month. Winter is a dry season as in winter,
cold winds blow from the interior landmass.
These areas are exposed to tropical cyclones.</li>
        <li>Mid-Humid Climate with Dry Summer/
Mediterranean Type
<br>
Extent: 30° to 45° L on western side of the
continent in both hemispheres; Around the
Mediterranean sea, in S. Europe, N. Africa,
California coast, Central Chile, Cape of
Good Hope, S.E. -Australia
Rainfall of driest month of summer: less
than 3 cm. Winter is the wettest month;
70% rainfall in the 6 winter months.
Monthly mean temperature: 20°C in
summer and 10°C in winter.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 40 to 90 cm only in winter
(Cyclonic rainfall).
Off shore trade winds blow in summer;
they are dry and give no rainfall.
Local winds like Sirocco, Mistral, Boro are
prevalent.</li>
        <li>Snowy Forest Climate with moist Winter/
Taiga
<br>
Extent: beyond 60° N in Europe, Asia and
N. America.
<br>
Annual rainfall: 30 to 40 cm; both in
winter and summer; No dry season.
<br>
Characteristics: Summers are short and
warm, warmest month temperature is 10°C
to 15°C.
Winter are long and severe, coldest month
temperature below-3°C. Have coniferous
forest vegetation.</li>
        <li>Snowy Forest climate with Dry Winter/
Manchurian Type
Extent: Eastern Siberia, Northern China,
Part of Japan, Korea, N.E. -USA, ECanada,
Temperature range is 20°C in summer and
5°C in winter
<br>
Annual rainfall: 50 cm. to 75 cm. Summer
is the season of rainfall, winter is dry.
Vegetation consists of mixed forest of
deciduous and coniferous trees.</li>
        <li>Tundra Climate
Extent: Arctic Ocean coast, Iceland,
Greenland
Mean temperature of the warmest month:
0°C to 10°C
<br>
Vegetation: Mosses, Lichens.
Annual range of temperature: 40°C to
50°C
<br>
Annual rainfall: 20-25 cm.
<br>
Characteristics: Summer is short, ground
may be snow free. During long winter soil
moisture freezes and snow covers the land
totally.</li>
        <li>Perpetual Forest Climate/Ice-cap Type
Extent: Antarctica, Greenland.
Temperature is always below 0°C,
throughout the year.
<br>
Winter- continuous night and summercontinuous days</li>
        <li>High Mountain Type
Extent: On high mountain slope of both
hemispheres. Himalayas and Andes have
vertical zonation of climate from tropical
to ice-cap type. 
<br>
Windward slope receives
heavy rainfall while the leeward sides are
dry. In the N-Hemisphere southern slopes
are warmer.</li>
