<h3>Hydrosphere</h3>


All the water of the earth including the oceans,
lakes, rivers, ice sheets and the water in the
atmosphere is called hydrosphere and it covers
about 71% of the earth's surface. The ocean
predominates over land areas in the S-Hemisphere
far more than that in the N-Hemisphere.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Major Oceans</i></strong></div>

<b>The Pacific Ocean:</b> It is the largest and deepest
ocean covering one third of the globe. Its average
depth is 4200 m. The deepest parts are the
Philippine Trench about 10,380 m. and the Marina
Trench about 10,800 m. The Pacific -Ocean has a
string of volcanoes along the coastal margins of
the conti-nents known as 'The Ring of Fire'.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Atlantic Ocean:</b> Though the Atlantic is
smaller than the Pacific, its total coastline is more
than that of the Pacific and the Indian Ocean
combined. There is a long submarine ridge running north to south in the middle of Atlantic. It
is the greatest mountain chain in the world
(16,000 km long). It is known as the Dolphin
Ridge in the North Atlantic and the Challenger
Ridge in the South Atlantic. There are also continental islands such as the British Isles, Newfoundland, the West Indies etc. The Atlantic is
the greatest commercial highway of the world.
<br>
<br>
<b>Indian Ocean:</b> It is small in size but has an
average depth of 4,000 m. The two great bays
on either side of the peninsula of India, namely
the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea belong to
the India Ocean. The Indian Ocean is dotted with
thousands of small islands some of which are of
coral formation, e.g. the Maldives and
Lakshadweep islands, while other like the
Mauritius and the Reunions are volcanic. Sri
Lanka and Malagasy are continental islands.
<br>
<br>
<b>Arctic Ocean:</b> It is found around the North
Pole. It covers only one thirtieth of the sea area.
It is almost completely covered with ice to a
depth of about 3 m.
<br>
<br>
<b>Antarctic Ocean:</b> The remaining area of the
sea is included in the Antarctic Ocean surrounding the Antarctic Continent.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Profile of Ocean Floor</i></strong></div>

The ocean basins are in many ways similar
to the land surface. There are submarine ridges,
plateau, canyons, plains and trenches. The great
variety of relief is largely due to the interaction
of tectonic, volcanic, erosional and depositional
processes. In general the ocean floor can be
divided into four major divisions - the
continental shelf, the continental slope, the
continental rise and the Abyssal Plain.
<br>
<br>
<b>Continental Shelf:</b> It is the land portion,
submerged under sea water and is a transitional
zone between the land and the actual sea bottom.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The isobath of 100 fathoms (around 200m)
demarcates the continental shelf.</li>
        <li>The average width is about 70 km. and the
mean slope is less than 1°.</li>
        <li>About 7.5 percent of the total ocean area is
covered by it.</li>
        <li>It is almost absent in the eastern Pacific
ocean, especially in South America.</li>
        <li>At the eastern coast of USA it is about 120
km wide and also very wide on the eastern
coast of India.</li>
        <li>Individually it covers about 13.3% part of
Atlantic Ocean, 5.7% of Pacific Ocean and
4.2% of Indian Ocean.</li>
        <li>It is the area of terrigenous deposits i.e.
sediments are derived from land.</li>
        <li>They provide the richest fishing ground in
the world.</li>
        <li>About 20% of world petroleum and natural
gas are found here.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Continental Slope:</b> It lies at the edge of the
continental shelf, generally up to the depth of
2000 fathoms (3660 m) from the mean sea level.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It has a steep slope with the angle of slope
varying from 2° to 5°.</li>
        <li>It covers about 8.5% of the total oceanic
area and individually about 12.4% of the
Atlantic Ocean, 7.1% of the Pacific Ocean
and 6.5% of the Indian Ocean.</li>
        <li>The continental blocks are supposed to end
at the site of continental slope.</li>
        <li>The continental slope along the many coasts
of the world is furrowed by deep canyons
like trenches terminating as fan-shaped
deposits at the base.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Continental Rise:</b> The place where the
continental slopes end, the gentle sloping
continental rise begins. The average slope is
between 0.5° and 1° & its general relief is low. With
increasing depth the Continental Rise becomes
virtually flat and it merges with abyssal plain.
<br>
<br>
<b>Abyssal/Deep Sea Plains:</b> Beyond
Continental Rise, it is found at the depth of 3000
to 6000 m. They cover about 40% of the total
ocean floor and generally are bounded by hills
(ridges) on the seaward side. They are almost
flat with a gradient less than 1:100. The irregular
topography of the abyssal plain are buried
forming relatively flat areas due to large supply
of sediments.
<br>
<br>
<b>Submarine Ridges:</b> These are the mountain
ranges on the ocean floor and some of them are
the largest mountain system on the earth.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A large number of submarine ridges are
placed centrally in the oceans.</li>
        <li>At some places their summits may rise
above the sea level forming islands.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Abyssal Hills:</b> A deep sea floor also
contains numerous isolated abyssal hills, seamounts and guyots.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A submarine mountain peak rising more
than 1000 m above ocean floor are known
as "seamount".</li>
        <li>Flat topped seamounts are known as
"Guyots".</li>
        <li>All the above features are volcanic in origin,
very common in Pacific Ocean.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Submarine Trenches or Deeps:</b> A long
narrow and steep sided depression on the ocean
floor is called trench. These are the deepest part
of the ocean.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>They lie along the fringes of the deep sea
plains and usually run parallel to the
bordering fold mountains or the island
claims.</li>
        <li>They are believed to have resulted from
faulting or down folds of the earth crust
and so tectonic in origin.</li>
        <li>They are most common in the Pacific Ocean
like "Mariana Trench" off the Guam Island
Chain which is deepest (11 km) in the
world.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Submarine Canyons:</b> These are the deep
gorges on the ocean floor and are restricted to
the continental shelves, slopes and rises.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Some canyons begin at the edge of the
continental shelf and extend down the
continental slope. For example -
"Oceanographer Canyon" near New
England.</li>
        <li>Some canyons have dendritic appearance
like off the east coast of Southern California.</li>
        <li>Some begins at the river mouth and extends
over the continental shelf as "Zaire",
"Mississippi" and "Indus" canyons.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Bank, Shoal & Reef:</b> Banks are almost flat
topped elevation located in the continental
margin. Shoals are detached elevation with
shallow depth. Reefs are the mound or rocky
elevation like ridges made of organic deposit.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The depth of water is relatively small in
banks but adequate for navigation.</li>
        <li>These are sites of rich fishing e.g. "Dogger
Bank" (North Sea), "Grand Bank" (off
Newfoundland).</li>
        <li>Shoals are dangerous for navigation as they
are only 18-20 m below the sea level.</li>
        <li>'Great Barrier Reef' (off Queens land,
Australia) is the largest reef in the world.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Temperature</i></strong></div>

Horizontal Distribution of Temperature: The
mean annual temperature of the surface water of
the oceans is 25°C varying from - 5°C to over 33°C.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The temperature decreases as we move
away from the equator. The average
temperature of ocean water is 26°C at the
equator, 23°C at latitude 20°.</li>
        <li>The coldest month in the ocean is February
and the warmest month is August in the
Northern Hemisphere and reverse in the
Southern Hemisphere.</li>
        <li>The highest temperature of ocean water is
found in enclosed or partially enclosed seas
in the equatorial areas e.g. a temperature
of 38°C has been recorded in Red Sea
though the average temperature in summer
is only 29°C.</li>
        <li>The temperature of the warm current is
higher than the surrounding areas. Thus
Gulf Stream does not allow the Norwegian
coast to freeze even in winter.</li>
        <li>The prevailing winds deflect the warm and
cold currents and cause change in
temperature of the ocean water. So, in the
tropical zone the western section of the
oceans are warmer than the eastern section
owing to the influence of trade winds. In
the Temperate zone the westerlies makes
the eastern section warmer than the
western section.</li>
        <li>The temperature decreases as we move
away from equator.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Vertical distribution of temperature:</b>
Though the sea temperature decreases with 
increasing depth, the rate of decrease is not uniform. 
The change in sea temperature below 200 m is negligible.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Salinity</i></strong></div>

The salinity of the Ocean means the
degree of saltiness of the oceans. The average
salinity of the oceans is 35.3% i.e. about 35
parts of salt in 1,000 parts of water. In the
Baltic Sea, where there is much dilution by
fresh water and melting ice, the salinity is
much lower only about 4%. Very high salinity
is recorded in inland seas and lakes. Lake van
in Turkey records the highest salinity of 330%.
Red Sea (240%), Dead sea (238%), Great Salt
Lake with (220%) are other areas of high
salinity.
<br>
<br>
The variation of salinity in the various seas
and oceans is affected by:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The rate of evaporation.</li>
        <li>The amount of fresh water added by
precipitation, streams and icebergs; and</li>
        <li>The degree of water mixing by currents.
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>The origin of salinity is attributed to
erosion of earth's crust by dissolving
action of running water which causes
erosion in the oceanic crust and volcanic
ash which contains minerals like
Calcium, Boron, Iodine, etc.</li>
                    <li>Salinity is excessive in region of high
temperature, strong winds and less rain.
For example, it is lower in the equatorial
region due to high relative humidity.</li>
                    <li>Influx of fresh water by rivers reduces the
salinity and so there is less salinity near
the mouths of rivers like Amazon, Congo,
Niger, Ganga etc.</li>
                    <li>In spite of high temperature salinity is less
is equatorial region because of his rainfall.
Around the Poles there is a belt of low
salinity because of addition of fresh water
in the form of icebergs and excessive
snow falls.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Horizontal Distribution of Salinity</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Latitudinal Distribution:</b> It decreases
from Equator towards the Poles. The average
salinity of N-Hemisphere is 34‰while for SHemisphere it is 35‰. In general there is low
salinity in equatorial zone, high in tropical
belt, low in temperate zone and minimum in
sub-polar zone.</li>
        <li><b>Regional Distribution:</b> The amount of
salinity varies from ocean to ocean, mainly due
to supply of fresh water, rapidity of evaporation
and water mixing tendency. The greatest
proportion of salt is found in two areas which
lie about the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of
Capricorn. From these regions the salinity
decreases both towards equator and the poles.
Salinity of the inland seas and lakes is very high
because of the regular supply of salt by the rivers
flowing into them and the evaporation makes
their water continuously more and more saline.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vertical Distribution of Salinity</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Salinity of the ocean decreases or increases
towards the bottom according to the nature
of the water mass.</li>
        <li>In high latitude salinity increases with
depth due to dense water found at the

increases with the depth upto 200 fathoms
and then it starts decreasing.</li>
        <li>At equator surface salinity is low but just
below it greater salinity is found which again
decreases at the bottom due to presence of
cold water mass.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ocean Deposits</i></strong></div>

The unconsolidated sediments derived
from various sources, deposited at the sea
floors are called ocean deposits. The ocean
deposits are classified on the basis of their
location as terrigenous and pelagic deposits.
<br>
<b>Terrigenous Deposits:</b> These are deposits
of the continental shelf and slope. They consist
of material derived from wear and tear of land,
the remains of animals and plants that live on
the bed of the sea and volcanic material. On
the basis of size of rock fragments, the
sediments are classified into gravel, sand and
mud. Mud is further classified as red, blue or
green mud on the basis of their colour.
Volcanic deposits consist of sub-aerial and sub
marine volcanic deposits. The organic deposits
consist of shells and skeletons of animals living
in the continental shelf.
<br>
<b>Pelagic Deposits:</b> These deposits are
found in deep sea plains. They cover 75 per
cent of the ocean area. The organic deposits
consist of liquid mud known as 'ooze' which
contain shells of various organisms. They are
subdivided into Calcareous ooze and Siliceous
ooze. The former contains Pteropod and
Globigerina ooze. The latter consists of
Radiolarian and Diatom ooze. The inorganic
deposits contain Red Clay, which is formed
from the decomposition of volcanic material
which is carried out to sea and occupies the
maximum space of the ocean floor.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Coral reefs & Atolls</i></strong></div>

Corals are a kind of calcareous rock chiefly
made of the skeletons of minute sea organisms
called 'polyps'. Coral reefs and atolls are formed
due to accumulation and compaction of
skeletons of these lime secreting organisms.
Conditions for Growth of Coral Reefs
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The coral and the associated organisms and
algae which are the most common reef
builders are con-fined to the tropical belt.
The water temperature must not fall below
20°C and not exceed 35°C; the most
favourable is 23°C to 25°C.</li>
        <li>Corals can live only in saline water, and
for their proper growth the average salinity
should be between 27 to 40%.</li>
        <li>For growth of coral the depth of the water
should not exceed 200m. Most vigorous
growth is confined to shallow water less
than 50 m. deep.</li>
        <li>Corals also require sediment-free, clean
water which is disturbed by ocean waves
and currents is beneficial for the corals.</li>
        <li>In the open seas it is necessary to have
platforms which may act as foundations
for the corals. These platforms should not
be deeper than 90 m.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



The coral reefs are classified on the basis of
nature, shape and mode of occurrence into (i)
Fringing reef (ii) Barrier reef (iii) Atoll.
Fringing Reef: Coral reefs that develop
along the continental margins or along the
islands are called fringing reefs. The seaward
slope is steep and vertical while the landward
slope is gentle. Such reefs are found near
Rameshwaram in the Gulf of Mannar.
<br>
<br>
Occasionally the fringing reef is separated from
the shore by shallow lagoon known as "Boat
Channel" as found in Madagascar and Red Sea.
Example of fringing reefs: South Florida reef,
Mehetia Island, Sakau Island in New Hebrides.
Barrier Reef: They are the largest, most
extensive, highest and widest reefs of all types
of coral reefs. They are formed off the coastal
platforms and parallel to them. There is an
extensive but shallow lagoon between the coastal
land and the barrier reef. Generally barrier reefs
encircle islands in an irregular and broken ring.
The Great Barrier Reef of Australia is the largest
barrier reef in the world.
<br>
<br>
<b>Atoll:</b> A ring of narrow growing corals of
horse shoe shape and crowned with palm trees
is called an atoll. It is generally found around an
island or in an elliptical form on a submarine
platform. There is a lagoon in the middle of a
coral ring. They are more common in Pacific
Ocean. The circular ring is broken at few places
to allow the free flow of water. The depth of the
lagoon is only a few metres with sand and
limestone debris at the bottom. Example of Atolls:
Fiji Atoll, Trunt Atoll of W-Carolinas, Suvadivo
in Maldives, Funafoothis Atoll of Ellice.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Geographical Distribution of Coral Reefs</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Coral reefs are limited to the tropical seas
and are found almost entirely between
latitudes 30°N and 25°S.</li>
        <li>Rich growth of reefs is found off the eastern
coasts of North America and Australia.</li>
        <li>On coasts where the rivers bring large
quantities of sediments from the land, corals
are not found e.g. coasts of South America.</li>
        <li>The coral reefs are most common in the
Pacific and the Indian Ocean, due to their
shallow, warm and clean water.</li>
        <li>The most important area of coral reef
growth lies in the seas off the east coast of
Australia and in the Philippines.</li>
        <li>Only a few coral reefs lie outside the IndoPacific tropical area, those of Gulf of Mexico
and the Caribbean Sea have some reefs.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>El Nino and La Nina</i></strong></div>

El Nino is a warm sub-surface current in the
Pacific Ocean off the Peruvian coast. El Nino
literally means 'child of the Christ'. It is a
destructive weather system pushed into action
by the warming of the cold ocean current in the
east pacific. El Nino's destructive capacity peaks
by late October or November, when it starts to
cool down and is called La-Nina or literally 'The
girl'. El Nino affects the monsoon in India. An El
Nino circulation in the winter suggests a strong
walker circulation in the following summer and
consequently a weak monsoon. However
scientists are still skeptical about its relation with
monsoon. Recently its link with the fire in
Indonesia has been subjected to much debate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ocean currents</i></strong></div>

The regular movements of water from one
part of the ocean to another are called "Ocean
Currents". They are mainly caused by the
difference in density of sea water due to
variations in temperature and salinity. The
prevailing winds push them onwards. The
position of the land masses and the shape and
depth of the ocean basins also have some
influence. Main causes of ocean currents include
- winds, differences in density owing to
variations in temperature and salinity. Ocean
currents may be cold or warm.

        <ol>
            <ul>
                <li>North Equatorial Current: Attributed to
NE-Trade winds, it starts from west coast
of Africa where upwelling of cold water
takes place and moves westward between
5° and 20° N as warm current. A branch
of it is diverted into Caribbean Sea as
"Antilles Current."</li>
                <li>South Equatorial Current: Flows south of
the equator between 0° and 12° latitude in
between the coast of Africa and S.
America. This warm current is virtually the
continuation of cold Benguela current.</li>
                <li>Equatorial Counter Current: This warm
current flows between the two strong
equatorial currents and moves towards the
opposition direction in the east. In the eastern
part it is known as "Guinea Current."</li>
                <li>Florida Warm Current: It flows from the
strait of Florida to Cape Hatteras which is
a continuation of North Equatorial current
in the Gulf of Mexico.</li>
                <li>Gulf Stream: The warm water of Antilles
and Florida current after joining together
flows as Gulf Stream, off the Cape Hatteras.
After it, it is deflected eastward under the
combined influence of westerlies and the
rotation of the earth.</li>
                <li>North Atlantic Drift: East of Grand Bank,
the Gulf Stream flows as slow moving North
Atlantic Drift. It is further divided into two
parts - the northern branch flows in the
Norwegian Sea and the southern branch
flows south of Ireland as "Irminger Current";
another branch flows along the coast of
France and Spain as "Canary Current".</li>
                <li>Labrador Cold Current: It flows from Arctic
Ocean and move southward along the coast
of Canada and meets the warm Gulf Stream
producing famous fog ground along the
Newfoundland as the great fishing ground.</li>
                <li>Brazilian Warm Current: It flows along
the S. American coast as the southward
continuation of South Equatorial Current.</li>
                <li>Falkland Cold Current: Similar to Labrador
cold current, this cold water of Antarctica
moves on along the Argentina coast. It
brings icebergs with it.</li>
                <li>South Atlantic Drift: It is the continuation
of easterly deflected Brazilian current
which moves earthward between 45°S to
60°S under the influence of strong
westerlies. A branch of it is diverted along
the west coast of Africa and moves north
as "Benguela Current."</li>
                <li>Benguela Current: This cold current flows
northward along the west-African coast. If
finally joins South Equatorial current.</li>

Being blocked in the north by the continental
mass the Indian Ocean represents only the
southern part of the ocean. The northern part
develops a reversal system of currents as per the
seasonal rhythm of Monsoon. In summer the
North Equatorial current is replaced by SWMonsoon current flowing from west to east and
throwing branches into the Bay of Bengal and
the Arabian Sea. On the northern coast of Africa
along Somaliland the upwelling takes place and
a cold current develops, known as "Somali
Current". South Equatorial current flows north
of 20ºS between Australia and Africa. After
striking the landmass of Africa it splits into many
branches; the major one turning southward to
form the "Agulhas Current".
<br>
<br>
<b>Mozambique Current:</b> A branch of South
Equatorial Current at 65°E is bifurcated towards
the north of Malagassy Republic and flows
through the Mozambique Channel known as
Mozambique current.
<br>
<br>
<b>West Wind Drift:</b> Under the stress of westerly
wind the cold water at 40°S moving in the easterly
direction is known as West Wind Drift. One
Branch of it flows northward along Australia
which forms West Australian Cold Current.
West Australian Cold Current: Flowing on
the west coast of Australia, its gains its water
from west wind drift.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pacific Ocean Currents:</i></strong></div>    
       
The Ocean Currents in the Pacific Ocean
have a pattern similar to that in the Atlantic
Ocean. Due to vast water masses the counter
current has become very stable.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>North Equatorial Current: It flows from
Mexican coast to Philippines between 5N
and 10N latitude. It is a warm well
developed current.</li>
        <li>South Equatorial Current: It is also a warm
current, south of North Equatorial Current.</li>
        <li>Counter Equatorial Current: This warm
current is very sable in nature.</li>
        <li>Kuroshio Warm Current : Similar to Gulf
stream of Atlantic Ocean, it flows from
Formosa to Rique, "Tsushima Current" is
its branch which goes to Japan Sea and is
a warm current.</li>
        <li>Kurile / Oyashio Cold Current: It flows
southward from the baring strait. Near 50°N
latitude it meets to Kuroshio Current
causing fog.</li>
        <li>Californian Cold Current: Similar to
Canaries current it flows along the west
coast of N. America.</li>
        <li>Peru / Humboldt Cold Current: It flows
along the Peru coast.</li>
        <li>East Australian Current: It is a warm
current along the east Australian coast.</li>
        <li>West Wind Drift: This cold current flows
from west to east direction between 40°S and

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tides</i></strong></div>

The alternative rise and fall of the level of
the Sea, approximately twice a day, caused by
the gravitational pull of the moon and the Sun
is called tide. The gravitational attraction of the
moon is twice as powerful as that of the Sun.
The moon despite being much smaller in size than
the Sun is relatively very close to the earth and
is thus able to attract more than the Sun.
High Tide: When the intensity of the wave
is great, the waves are of considerable amplitude
and so the sea water comes over the coast to some
extent. Such waves constitute a high tide.
Low Tide: When the height of the wave is
not much, sea water recedes from the shore. Such
waves constitute a low tide.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ebb Tide:</b> The tide between a high tide and
a low tide is known as ebb tide.
<br>
<br>
<b>Spring Tide:</b> When the amplitude difference
of the tide in a day is at maximum, the tide is
called spring tide. It occurs on new moon and
full moon days. High tides are very high and low
tides very low on those days.
<br>
<br>
<b>Neap Tide:</b> When the amplitude of the tide
is minimum. It occurs on the first quarter and last
quarter of the moon. High tides are comparatively
low and low tides comparatively high.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tidal Bores:</b> When a tidal wave meets a
tidal river or estuary, a tidal bore is formed.
Where the outgoing river currents are strong and
the tidal river rather shallow and tunnel shaped,
the rapidly rising high water advances up stream
like a high vertical wall, known as tidal bore.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Bore occurs at river mouths that face the
direction of tidal surge and where tidal
range is large. Rivers like Amazon,
Hooghly, Colorado, Yangtze are
characterized by tidal bores.</li>
        <li>Although tides occur twice a day, their
interval is not exactly 12 hours; actually
it is of 12 hours and 25 minutes. This is
due to the revolution of the moon and
the rotation of the earth.</li>
        <li>Generally tides occur twice a day. But
Southampton, along the southern coast of
England experiences tides four times a day
because the tidal water comes through the
English Channel and through the North
Sea at different intervals.</li>
        <li>Tides in the area of the sea, known as
"Gulf Tides" also causes the horizontal
movement of water of the sea known as
"Tidal Current".</li>
        <li>Monthly tides occur due to revolution of
moon and its position at perigee and
apogee.</li>
        <li>Equinoctial Spring tides recur at an
interval of 6 months, due to revolution
of the earth around the sun and sun's
varying declination.</li>
        <li>Yearly tides recur due to revolution of the
earth and its position at perihelion and
aphelion.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Importance of tides</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tides make some of the rivers navigable for
ocean going vessels e.g., Kolkata, London etc.</li>
        <li>Tides clear the sediments brought by rivers
and thus retard the process of delta
formation.</li>
        <li>Tides are agents of distribution; biologically
they distribute and redistribute the
plankton and nektons along with coastal
water which helps in fishing industries.</li>
        <li>The tidal force may be used as the source of
electricity e.g. In France, Japan, India etc.</li>
