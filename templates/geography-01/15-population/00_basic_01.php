<h3>Population</h3>



Human geography embraces the study of
human race, the growth of human numbers, the
movements and density of population, etc. Thus
human geography is a science which studies the
relationship between man and environment.
<br>
<br>
Factors Influencing Population Distribution
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Accessibility:</b> Man was unable to reach
inaccessible areas of forest, islands,
mountains for a long time, so such areas
have low density as in the Amazon basin,
S. American Plateaus, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Relief:</b> Steep gradients, high mountains,
rugged-terrain restrict settlement because
of hindrances in movement. Similarly rivers
may exert either a positive or negative
effects. Most attract settlement but some
are liable to flooding, change of coarse and
so hinder settlements.</li>
        <li><b>Altitude and Latitude:</b> There are very few
settlements above 5500 m in Andes and
Himalayas. 'La Paz' (Bolivian Capital) is at
the height of 3640 m. Low latitude high
plateau areas provide positive advantage.</li>
        <li><b>Climate:</b> Extreme heat, cold, humidity and
aridity deter settlement. Success of crops
also depends on climate. But no specific
climate is optimum for settlement as obvious
from the fact that two of the world primary
concentration of population lie in middle
latitude and the third is located in the
tropics. For example Java Island and
Amazon Basin have the same climate but
population density of Java is over 500
whereas Amazon basin has less than 1.</li>
        <li><b>Soil:</b> Deltaic and alluvial soils attract settlement
while laterites and podzols repel. All ancient
civilizations evolved in alluvial soil regions.
Higher density of Jawa as compared to
Sumatra is also due to soil fertility.</li>
        <li><b>Natural Vegetation:</b> It may also exert
positive as well as negative effects on
settlement.</li>
        <li><b>Mineral and Energy Resources:</b> Population
map of W. Europe is more or less identical
to distribution of coalfields and other
industries. S. African Rand, Appalachian
Coalfield, Donetz Basin, W-Australia also
show its effects.</li>
        <li><b>Economic Factor:</b> Density of population is
directly proportional to technological and
economic advancement. Migration of
Indian labourers to Mauritius, Trinidad and
Fiji under colonial rule shows this pattern.</li>
        <li><b>Political Factors:</b> Unlike communist countries
in the western world various inducements
may be offered to encourage migration to
new towns. Mass migration of Asian from
Uganda in 1972 is another example.</li>
        <li><b>Historical Factor:</b> Relatively recent settlement
of Australia is the basic reason for its low
density of 2. While high density of India is
liable to be explained in terms of its long
history of civilization and occupancy.</li>

belong to Monsoonal regions having
about 57% of the world population.
China and India alone constitute 38%
of world population. East Asia has
25% and S.Asia has 23% of World
Population.</li>
        <li>Monsoonal regions are characterized
by vast fertile land, favourable
climate for agriculture, perennial
rivers, paddy farming and historical
inertia of human settlement and all
these favour greater concentration.</li>
        <li>Western Europe and NE N. America
have very high population density
due to tremendous development of
secondary and tertiary industries.</li>
        <li>Although having almost infertile
lands small countries like
Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemberg
have very high density because of
high industrial development and
other non-primary activities like
fisheries and forestry.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Demographic Transition Theory</i></strong></div>

Formulated by Frank Notestein in 1953, the
theory of Demographic Transition makes an
attempt to document the experience of
developing countries as affected by the presentday economic growth. 'Demographic Transition'
is described as the passage through which
countries move from high birth and death rates
to low ones. This has been the experience of
countries going through a process of modernizing
economic and social development.
<br>
<br>
Stages of Demographic Transition
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The first stage is characterized by high birth
and death rates. High death rates in such a
society could be due to chronic malnutrition,
famines and epidemics, inadequate
medicinal and health services and poor living
condition. High birth rates are influenced
by the socio-cultural system (i.e. illiteracy,
early marriage, traditional values, religious
beliefs, demand for family labour, etc).</li>
        <li>In stage two, that of a developing country,
the death rates drop rapidly due to
improvements in food supply and sanitation,
which increase life spans and reduce disease.
These changes usually come about due to
improvements in farming techniques, access
to technology, basic healthcare, and
education. Without a corresponding fall in
birth rates this produces an imbalance, and
the countries in this stage experience a large
increase in population.</li>
        <li>In stage three, birth rates fall due to access
to contraception, increases in wages,
urbanization, a reduction in subsistence
agriculture, an increase in the status and
education of women, a reduction in the
value of children's work, an increase in
parental investment in the education of
children and other social changes.
Population growth begins to level off.</li>
        <li>During stage four there are both low birth
rates and low death rates. Birth rates may
drop to well below replacement level as has
happened in countries like Germany, Italy
and Japan, leading to a shrinking population,
a threat to many industries that rely on
population growth. As the large group born
during stage two ages, it creates an economic
burden on the shrinking working population.
Death rates may remain consistently low or
increase slightly due to increases in lifestyle
diseases due to low exercise levels and high
obesity and an aging population in
developed countries.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Growth Rate of Developing Countries</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Countries of Explosion:</b> Most of the Islamic
countries, Latin America, S. Africa, S.EAsian countries. It has very high birth rate
over 30% and low death rate of 15%, so
natural increase is very high.</li>
        <li><b>Countries of Potential Explosion:</b>
Central African & some S.E Asian
countries like Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam.
At present both high birth rate and high
death rate over 40%. But in the near
future death rate will go down hence
the population explosion.</li>
        <li><b>Countries of Managed Population:</b> They
have successfully managed the growth rate
like China (1.2%), Jamaica (1.4%), S. Africa
(0.8%) and El-Salvador (1.2%).</li>

intermixture. They constitute 43% of the world
population.</li>
