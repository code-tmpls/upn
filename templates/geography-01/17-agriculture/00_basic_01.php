<h3>Agriculture</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Different Agricultural Types</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On the basis of supply of land: Intensive
agriculture and Extensive agriculture
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Intensive method is practiced where the
supply of land is limited and density of
population is high. China, Japan, India,
UK, Holland, Germany and Belgium
practice this method.</li>
        <li>Extensive method is practiced in sparsely
populated area - where per man land
area is higher and where there is scope
for bringing additional land under cultivation e.g. USA, Russia, Australia, 
Argentina and Brazil.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>On the basis of supply of moisture: Humid farming, Irrigation farming and Dry
farming.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Humid farming is practiced where there
is no dearth of rainwater for the
production of crops. Problems of water
logging and drainage and soil erosion are
present in the heavy rainfall areas.</li>
        <li>Irrigation farming is practiced in those
areas where rainfall is seasonal and the
amount is not satisfactory for crop
production. In the river valleys of the
world this farming is practiced.</li>
        <li>Dry farming: areas having very little
rainfall less than 50cm and very little
irrigation facilities practice dry farming.
Crops which can bear the high cost of
production e.g. cotton and wheat is
grown under this method.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The types of farming practised are discussed
below:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Shifting cultivation</i></strong></div> 
        
A primitive form of agriculture practiced
mainly in the tropics wherein a plot of land in
cultivated for a few years, until the production
declines due to soil exhaustion. Slash and burn
method is practiced in which forests are cut and
burnt nutrients are returned to the soil. On the
interval few years the process is repeated and
this a cycle is formed in the long run.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Plantation farming:</i></strong></div>    
        
 An estate farming mostly in tropical and
subtropical regions devoted to large scale production of one or more cash crops e.g. Coffee,
Rubber and Tea, etc.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Truck farming:</i></strong></div> 
        
 Refers to the intensive cultivation of vegetables for the market and therefore 
 is corresponding to the term market gardening that is
usually done in U.K. Truck farms, however, appears to be more specialized and 
truck farms are generally situated farther from the markets.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mixed farming:</i></strong></div>    
        
It refers to the combination of agriculture
and livestock farming.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Collective farming:</i></strong></div> 
       
A type of agricultural organization started
in former USSR and then adopted in Eastern
Europe, China, N. Vietnam and N. Korea. Large
farms covering thousands of hectares are managed by co-operative bodies and the govt. and
called Kolkhoz and Sovkhoz respectively. The
workers receive shares of the sale proceeds as
wages, according to the work done.
Kibbutz- community farming in Israel. These
are smaller than the collective farms.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nomadic Herding:</i></strong></div>    
        
It's a type of shifting pastoral farming in
which pastoralists move from one place to another in search of good pasture. 
It is mainly practiced in arid and hilly regions and primitive societies. 
Animals like Cattle, sheep and goat are
reared for milk, meat, wool etc.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Transhumance:</i></strong></div>    
        
It is also concerned with animal husbandry
but in thin the people have their permanent
settlement and they move to a suitable place only
in adverse climatic condition and return back to
their homeland as the climatic condition becomes normal. Mountains of Himalayas, Rockies,
Alps and Norway are famous region for transhumance. In India Gaddis of Himachal Pradesh
and Bakarwals of J&K practice transhumance.</li>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Wheat</i></strong></div>    
        
Wheat is the dominant grain of world commerce and is the staple food of millions of people.
It is also an important part of the daily diet of
many millions more. The world wheat market is
enormous. Annual global wheat consumption
is in excess of 550 million tonnes (20 billion bushels). Approximately two-thirds of the wheat produced in the world is used for human food and
about one-sixth is used for livestock feed. Industrial uses, seed requirements, and post-harvest
losses account for the remaining withdrawals
from the world wheat granaries. The geographical concentration of wheat is found between 30-
55°N latitude in the Northern hemisphere and
between 20-40°S in Southern hemisphere.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions of Growth</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A minimum temperature of 16°C and bright
sunshine for ripening, and 100 frost free days.</li>
        <li>A mild moist season with annual rainfall
ranging between 50 cm and 100 cm.</li>
        <li>A relatively stiff, preferably loamy and nonacidic soils.</li>
        <li>Level or slightly rolling lands to facilitate
mechanical methods of farming.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In terms of net output four countries viz.
Russia, U.S.A., China and India contribute over
50% of world production. But temperate countries like France, Spain, Argentina, and Australia are also important contributing most (20%)
of world's wheat.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Distribution of Wheat:</i></strong></div>

<b>USA:</b> According to regional diversity of climate four major wheat growing 
belt can be distinguished they are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>White wheat region of the Colombian
plateau;</li>
        <li>Hard red spring wheat of the N provinces;</li>
        <li>Hard red winter wheat of the W and S
provinces, and</li>
        <li>Soft red winter wheat of the Southern
states.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Russia:</b> The wheat production is concentrated in black chernozem soil belt. They are
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The north Caucasus region producing
winter wheat in the south-western part and</li>
        <li>The Volga region of the spring wheat</li>
        <li>The eastern regions including trans-Ural
and western Siberia producing best hard
spring wheat in the world.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>China:</b> China is the largest producer of
wheat in the world. Wheat is produced in the
area irrigated by the Huang-Ho, Hopei, Shansi,
Shantung and Hainan districts are important
wheat producing areas.
<br>
<br>
<b>Australia:</b> The important wheat growing
areas are in the fertile plains of Murray Darling
basin and in the S.W. Australia. Uncertainty of
rainfall, great distance from markets and low
population are main deterrents.
<br>
<br>
<b>Argentina:</b> Wheat farming is confined to the
great wheat crescent which is bounded to the
west by the 40 cm isohyets and to the east by the
100 cm isohyets lines.
<br>
<br>
<b>Export:-</b>
USA, Canada, Argentina and Australia are
leading exporting countries whose share is almost 80%. Britain, Japan, Germany, Belgium,
Holland, Italy are leading importers.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rice</i></strong></div>
            
Rice is normally grown as an annual plant,
although in tropical areas it can survive as a
perennial crop for up to 30 years. The rice plant
can grow to 1-1.8 m tall, occasionally more depending on the variety and soil fertility.
<br>
<br>
Conditions of growth
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Hot and humid climate - high degree of
temperature ranging between 20°-27°C and
minimum rainfall 120 cm. It also requires
water logging particularly in the early parts
of its growth and deep clayey loams.</li>
        <li>Rice needs a level surface to ensure annual
flooding of the fields. It's most ideal habitat
is therefore, the great riverine flood-plains
of the world.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<br>
<br>
<b>Distribution:</b>
Monsoonal low lands of South-east Asia is the
most outstanding region for rice growing in the
world-accounting for 85% of the total rice acreage of the world and produce 90% of the world
output. The noted rice producing countries in the
world include China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh,
Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, Italy, Spain, USA
and Brazil are other producing countries.
<br>
<br>
<b>China</b>
China is also the largest producer of rice in
the world. Sichuan basin is the largest producer
followed by Red Basin, riverine flood plain of
Yangtze basin, Yunnan and Kweichow provinces, Fukien, Kwanghing and Kwangsi and
Hunan, Kiangsi and Chungking province. The soil
fertility, use of manures and unified management
are responsible for higher productivity.
India is the second longest producer of rice
in the world.

<br>
<b>Bangladesh</b> is the third largest producer of
rice, though rice is grown everywhere Dacca,
maymansingh, Bakharganj, Faridpur, Barisal
districts account bulk of the country's output.
<br>
<br>
<b>Japan:</b> rice is grown throughout the country; per 
hectare production is very high. But high
domestic demand and limited land forces the
country to import rice.
<br>
<br>
The fertile alluvial plains of Irrawady in
Myanmar, the Red Basin of North Vietnam, the
Mekong Basin of South Vietnam, and the Menam
Basin of Thailand are also notable in rice production. Rice is also grown in Nile valley and
delta of Egypt, S.E. Brazil and Gulf of Mexico in
the USA and Po river valley in Italy.
<br>
<br>
<b>Export:-</b>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Silk</i></strong></div>    
        
Silk is a natural protein fiber, some forms of
which can be woven into textiles. The bestknown type of silk is obtained from cocoons made
by the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombx
mori reared in captivity. The birth place of silk is
China as from there it spread to Japan, India,
Southern Europe and Western Asia.
Commercial production of silk involves four
different stages: (a) growing of mulberry trees
(b) rearing of silk (c) tendering of cocoons (d)
reeling of silk.
<br>
<br>
The temperature should be between 20-30°C
each cocoon has 762 to 915 meters of filament. For
the ideal growth of cocoon, high temperature and
heavy rainfall is required. The mulberry trees can
be grown on poor acid and infertile soils. This is
why they are relegated to the rugged lands or hilly
tracts which are not available for food production.
<br>
<br>
<b>Distribution:</b>
Japan is leading producer of silk in the world
- the production is taking place from northern
Honshu to South Kyushu. The great concentration of production is in Lake Suwa region of
Central Honshu - high temperature heavy rainfall and rugged topography is easily available.
<br>
<b>China</b> - Production is centered in south and
west of Shanghai, in parts of Szechwan basin, in
the delta region of Si-Kiang near Canton. Shantung
Peninsula also participates in production.
<br>
<b>Korea</b> - the relief, soil and climatic conditions favors the growth and throughout the
country it is the subsidiary occupation of the
farmers.
<br>
<b>In Europe</b> - PO valley of Italy is famous for
silk production. France is also important.
India is the only country where all four types
of raw silk are produced- Mulberry, Eeri, Tusser,
and Muga.
<br>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tea</i></strong></div>    
        
Tea is the agricultural product of the leaves,
leaf buds, and internodes and is the most popular drink in the world in terms of consumption.
Its consumption equals all other manufactured
drinks in the world - including coffee, chocolate,
soft drinks, and alcohol - put together.[4] Most
tea consumed outside East Asia is produced on
large plantations in India or Sri Lanka.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions of growth</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>High temperature of 27°C abundant rainfall
of about 200 cm and high amount of
moisture in the air. This climatic condition
confines the cultivation in rainy tropical
and humid tropical regions. High humidity,
heavy dews and morning fog favors rapid
development of young leaves.</li>
        <li>Relatively high sloping ground - so as to
prevent water logging in the plant and
should contain iron content acidic in nature.</li>
        <li>Large and cheap labour supply.
<br>
<br>
        <b>Distribution:</b>
These environmental and economic features
are present in South and East Asian countries
and hence more than nine-tenth of production
comes from there continuously. More than 75%
of the global output of tea comes from India,
China, Srilanka, Japan and Indonesia. Outside
the realm of monsoonal Asia. The tea is grown
in USSR Kenya, Malawi and Turkey.
<br>
<br>
<b>India</b> is the largest producer of tea in the
world.
<br>
<b>China:</b> Chief production areas are lying between the Yangtze and Sinkiang valleys. Red
soils of the hilly areas of the provinces of Hunan,
Anhui, Sichuan, Zhejiang and Fujian are important producing states. China has the largest area
under tea cultivation in the world. China is the
largest producing green leaf tea in the world.
<br>
<b>Srilanka</b> - Tea states are highly concentrated in the Nuwara Eliya and the Badulla
areas. In small quantity of tea is also grown in
Kandy and in the hills behind Gale and
Malara. Srilanka is the second largest exporter
of tea in the world.
<br>
<b>Japan</b> - Tea is grown mostly on the Pacific
coast on the low terraced slopes of the mountains enriched with highly fertile volcanic soils.
Uzi and Shizouka districts of southern Honshu

Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from
roasted seeds, commonly called coffee beans, of
the coffee plant. They are seeds of coffee cherries that grow on trees in over 70 countries. Coffee is usually propagated by seeds. The traditional
method of planting coffee is to put 20 seeds in
each hole at the beginning of the rainy season
Conditions of growth
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm climate conditions annual range of
temperature is between 21° and 26°c and
winter temperature should not fall below 10°.</li>
        <li>High rainfall ranging between 125 and 150
cm. The hot rainy season helps the plants
to grow rapidly and dry winter seasons
favors the proper ripening and harvesting.</li>
        <li>Well drained fertile, soil rich in plant nutrient
such as iron and potash are useful. Terra
Roxa soil is ideal for coffee plant. The plant
grows usually on hill slopes and highlands
having in altitude of 1800 to 2500 ft.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sugarcane</i></strong></div>
            
Sugarcane growing countries of the world
are lying between the latitude 36.7° north and
31.0° south of the equator extending from tropical to subtropical zones.
<br>
<br>
<b>Condition of growth</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Warm climatic conditions the annual
temperature ranging between 21-27°C</li>
        <li>It grows best in the regions having about
125 cm of annual rainfall. If the amount of
rainfall exceeds the optimum level, the
sucrose content declines.</li>
        <li>Deep, well drained fertile soils are most
important for sugarcane cultivation water
logging is highly detrimental.</li>
        <li>Sugarcane growing is, highly labor intensive
in nature. Therefore, densely populated topical countries are most 
imported for sugarcane cultivation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Distribution:</b>
 Sugarcane is most widely grown in a number of tropical and sub-tropical countries but the
two principal sugarcane areas are (i) South-east
Asia-India, Pakistan, China, Indonesia and Thailand and (ii) Latin America - Cuba and Brazil.
<br>
<br>
<b>China</b> - contributes about 6% of the world's
sugarcane rugged Terrain limit the cultivable
areas only to river basins.
<br>
<b>Indonesia</b> - cane is most intensively a cultivated in the Java islands where the climoedaphic- economic condition is ideal.
India is the largest producer of cane in the
world.
<br>
<b>Pakistan</b> - produces a little over 4% of the
world output - cultivation is mainly concerned
in irrigated plains.
<br>
<b>Brazil</b> - produces more than 15% of the
world output and comes next only to India - due
to suitability of environmental conditions. The
principal area of concentration include (a) the
coastal lands of the north-east in the states of
Prarahiba, Peruamnbuo, Alagoas and Bahia (b)
The Minas Gerais district and (c) the coastal
plains North-east of Rio-de-Janerio.
<br>
<b>Cuba</b> - its economy is to a great extent dependent on sugarcane cultivation - is the third
largest producer of sugarcane in the world. The
favorable environmental and economic conditions
led the concentration in the districts of Havana,
Metanzas, Orienta and Santa Clara. Nearness to
vast American market is an added advantage.
<br>
<b>Australia</b> - Produces little over 4% of the
world's sugarcane cultivation predominates
along the east coastal plains of Australia stretching from northern New South Wales to North
Queensland. Queensland is the most important
producing state.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sugar Beet</i></strong></div>    
        
Sugar beet is a plant whose root contains a
high concentration of sucrose. It is grown commercially for sugar production. Sebewaing,
Michigan is known (to Americans) as the sugar
beet capital of the world.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions of growth</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar beet is a native of temperature climatic
regions with moist and mild winter and
moderate summer temperature. It is very
sensitive to annual ranges of rainfall which
should necessarily be around 60-65 cm.</li>
        <li>Loose friable deep soils which favor
uninterrupted penetration of the beet roots.</li>
        <li>Since it is a highly capital intensive crop,
its cultivation limited only to the rich
countries.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Distribution:</b>
Europe and America have over whelming
superiority in beet cultivation since they contribute almost 85% of the global output.
Russia is the largest producer contributing the
fourth of the global output. Apart from Russia
France, Germany, Czech Republic is the dominant
producers.USA is the third largest producer contributing more than 8% of global output-mainly

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rubber</i></strong></div>    
        
The commercial source of natural rubber latex is the Para rubber tree. Rubber latex is extracted from Rubber trees. The economic life
period of rubber trees in plantations is around
32 years - up to 7 years of immature phase and
about 25 years of productive phase.
<br>
<br>
<b>Conditions of Growth</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Rubber is a tropical crop of the humid
tropical countries, therefore, thrives best in
the regions having high temperature and
annual precipitation, where temperature is
less than 21°C it may not be grown. Rubber
survives best in the regions with about 150
to 250 cm. of rainfall.</li>
        <li>Deep loose and well-drained alluvial soils
provide the most ideal ground for rubber
growing. Gently undulating surface conditions
prevent water logging and check soil erosion.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
