<h3>Energy Resources</h3>


Most of the world's energy resources are
from the sun's rays hitting earth. Some of that
energy has been preserved as fossil energy; some
is directly or indirectly useable; for example, via
wind, hydro- or wave power.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Coal</i></strong></div>

Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel found in
sedimentary source most of which has been formed
during Carboniferous period. This was the fuel that
launched the industrial revolution and has continued to grow 
in use; China, which already has many
of the world's most polluted cities, is building about
two coal-fired power plants every week. Coal is the
fastest growing fossil fuel and its large reserves
would make it a popular candidate to meet the energy 
demand of the global community, short of global warming concerns and other pollutants.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Types of Coal:</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mineral Oil</i></strong></div>

It is obtained from those decomposed tiny
marine creatures, minute plants and animals,
which were buried under the sediments about
10 to 20 crores years ago. It is generally found in
dome like structures of sedimentary rocks but
all sedimentary rocks may not have mineral oil.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Natural Gas</i></strong></div>

Natural gas primarily consists of methane. It is
found associated with fossil fuels, in coal beds, as
methane clathrates, and is created by methanogenic
organisms in marshes, bogs, and landfills. It is an
important fuel source, a major feedstock for fertilizers, and a potent greenhouse gas.
The world's largest proven gas reserves are
located in Russia. Russia is also the world's largest natural gas producer, through the Gazprom
Company. Major proven resources are Russia,
Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and United Arab
Emirates.
<br>
<br>
The world's largest gas field is Qatar's offshore North Field, estimated to have 25 trillion
cubic metres of gas in place—enough to last more
than 200 years at optimum production levels.
The second largest natural gas field is the South
Pars Gas Field in Iranian waters in the Persian
Gulf. Generally natural gas occurs together with
mineral oil in the anticlines of sedimentary rocks.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nuclear Energy</i></strong></div>

Nuclear power is power produced from controlled nuclear reactions. Commercial plants in
use to date use nuclear fission reactions. Electric
utility reactors heat water to produce steam,
which is then used to generate electricity. 14%
of the world's electricity came from nuclear
power, despite concerns about safety and radioactive waste management.
Nuclear fusion reactions are widely believed
to be safer than fission and appear potentially
viable, though technically quite difficult. Fusion
power has been under intense theoretical and
experimental investigation for many years.
Both fission and fusion appear promising for
some space propulsion applications in the midto distant-future, 
using low thrust for long durations to achieve high mission velocities.
On June 27, 1954, the USSR's Obninsk
Nuclear Power Plant became the world's first
nuclear power plant to generate electricity, and
produced around 5 megawatts of electric power.
The world's first commercial nuclear power
station, Calder Hall in Sellafield, England was
opened in 1956 with an initial capacity of 50 MW
(later 200 MW). The first commercial nuclear
generator to become operational in the United
States was the Shipping port Reactor.
<br>
<br>
Many countries remain active in developing nuclear power, 
including China, India, Japan and Pakistan, all actively 
developing both fast and thermal technology,
South Korea and the United States, developing thermal 
technology only, and South
Africa and China, developing versions of the
Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR). Several EU member states actively pursue
nuclear programs, while some other member states continue to have a ban for the
nuclear energy use.
Uranium and thorium are major sources
which are radioactive minerals having immense
capacity to generate energy through nuclear fission.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hydel Energy</i></strong></div>

Hydroelectricity is electricity generated by
hydropower, i.e., the production of power
through use of the gravitational force of falling
or flowing water. It is the most widely used form
of renewable energy. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and has a considerably lower output
level of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2)
than fossil fuel powered energy plants. Worldwide, an installed capacity of 777 GWe (Giga
watt - Electric) supplied 2998 TWh (tera watt
hours) of hydroelectricity in 2006. This was
around 20% of the world's electricity and about
88% of electricity from renewable sources.
<br>
<br>
<b>Distribution:</b>
<br>
In the Scottish Highlands of United Kingdom,
there are examples at Kinlochleven and Lochaber,
constructed during the early years of the 20th
century. The Grand Coulee Dam, switched to
support Alcoa aluminum in Bellingham, Washington, United States for 
irrigation and power (in
addition to aluminum power).
In Surinam, the Brokopondo Reservoir was
constructed to provide electricity for the Alcoa
aluminium industry. New Zealand's Manapouri
Power Station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium 
smelter at Tiwai Point.
As of 2007 the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Project
in Iceland remains controversial.
<br>
<br>
<b>Failure Hazard:</b>
Dam failures have been some of the largest
man-made disasters. Also, good design and construction are not an 
adequate guarantee of safety.
For example, the Banqiao Dam failure in
Southern China resulted in the deaths of 171,000
people and left millions homeless. Also, the creation of a dam in a 
geologically inappropriate
location may cause disasters like that of Vajont
Dam in Italy, where 2000 people died in 1963.
Smaller dams and micro hydro facilities create less risk, but can form continuing hazards
even after they have been decommissioned. For
example, the Kelly Barnes small hydroelectric
dam failed in 1967, causing deaths with the
Toccoa Flood, ten years after its power plant was
decommissioned in 1957.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Solar Energy</i></strong></div>

It is common knowledge that solar radiation
is unevenly distributed, and that it varies in intensity from one geographic 
location to another depending upon the latitude, season, and time of day.
Until recently, valid records for solar radiation have
been very scanty in the vast majority of the developing countries. In the 
absence of such useful information as a guide for the proper exploitation of
solar energy, only general hints can be offered regarding the geographic areas 
with favourable conditions for solar energy applications.
For convenience and simplicity, the geographic distribution of total solar 
radiation on a global scale is divided in terms of intensity into
four broad belts around the earth. These are illustrated in Figure 2, and also 
described briefly thereunder with respect to the northern hemisphere, 
with the understanding that the same
conditions apply to the corresponding belts in
the southern hemisphere:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Most Favourable belt</b>
        <br>
        <br>
 This belt, lying between latitudes 15°N, and
35°N, embraces the regions that are naturally
endowed with the most favourable conditions
for solar energy applications. These semi-arid
regions are characterized by having the greatest
amount of solar radiation, more than 90% of
which comes as direct radiation because of the
limited cloud coverage and rainfall (less than 250
mm per year).</li>
        <li><b>Moderately Favourable belt</b>
 This belt lies between the equator and latitude 15°N, and is 
 the next most favourable region for the purpose previously mentioned. 
 Because the humidity is high, and cloud cover is
frequent, the proportion of scattered radiation
is quite high. There is a total of about 2,500 hours
of sunshine per year. The solar intensity is almost 
uniform throughout the year as the seasonal variations are only slight.</li>
        <li><b>Less Favourable belt</b>
 This belt lies between latitude 35°N and
45°N. Although the average solar intensity is
roughly about the same as for the other two belts,
there are marked seasonal variations in both radiation intensity and daylight hours. 
During the winter months solar radiation is relatively lower
than in the rest of the year.</li>
        <li><b>Least Favourable belt</b>
The regions in this belt lie beyond latitude
45°N. They include the USSR, and the greater
parts of northern Europe and North America.
Here, about half of the total radiation is diffuse radiation, with a higher proportion in
winter than in summer primarily because of
the rather frequent and extensive cloud coverage.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
