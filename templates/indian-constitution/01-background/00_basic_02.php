    <h3>Framing Of Indian Constitution</h3>
    It was under the Cabinet Mission Plan of
1946 that the Constituent Assembly was constituted to frame a Constitution for India. The
Constituent Assembly, which had been elected for undivided India and held its first sitting on
Dec. 9, 1946, reassembled on Aug. 14, 1947, as
the sovereign Constituent Assembly for the Dominion of India. As a result of the partition under the Plan of 
June 3, 1947,

<div class="subheading"><strong>How The Constituent Assembly Of India was Constituted?</strong></div>

The Constituent Assembly of India was elected
through indirect election by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assembly (Lower House only), according
to the scheme recommended by the Cabinet Delegation. The essentials of this scheme were as follows:
<ul>
    <li>The Provinces elected 292 members; 
        while the Indian States were allotted a maximum of 93 seats.</li>
    <li>The seats in each province were distributed among
the three main committees Muslim, Sikh, and General, in proportion to their respective 
population.</li>
    <li> Members of each community in the Provincial Legislative Assembly elected their own 
        representatives
by the method of proportional representation with
single transferable vote.</li>
    <li>The method of selection in the case of representatives
of Indian States was to be determined by nomination.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong>Acceptance of the Constitution:</strong></div>
 On Aug.
29, 1947, the Constituent Assembly appointed
a Drafting Committee under the chairmanship
of Dr. Ambedkar. This committee came out
with a draft Constitution of India in Feb. 1948.
The Constituent Assembly next met in Nov.
1948 to consider the provisions of the Draft
Committee, clause by clause. The second reading of the clauses was completed by Oct. 17,
1949, and the third reading on Nov. 26, 1949,
when the Constitution received the signature
of the President of the Assembly and was
declared as passed. While certain provisions of
the constitution - those relating to citizenship,
elections, provisional Parliament, etc. were
given immediate effect, the rest of the Constitution came into force on Jan. 26, 1950 
because the Congress had been celebrating Independence Day on January 26 every year since
1930. The Constituent Assembly itself became
the first provisional parliament. The first elections to parliament were held in 1952

<h3>Philosophy Of Indian
Constitution</h3>
On January 22, 1947 the Constituent Assembly adopted the Objectives Resolution drafted
by Jawaharlal Nehru. The Objective Resolution
contained the fundamental propositions of the
Constitution and set forth the political ideas
that should guide its deliberations. The main
principles of the resolution were:
<ul>
    <li>India is to be an Independent, sovereign republic.</li>
    <li>It is to be a democratic union with an equal level of self-government in 
        all the Constituent parts;
    </li>
    <li>All power and the authority of the Union Government and governments of the 
        Constituent parts is derived from the people. 
    </li>
    <li>The Constitution must strive to obtain and guarantee to the people justice based upon 
        social, economic and political equality of opportunity and equality before law; 
    </li>
    <li>There should be freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship, vocation, 
        association and action;</li>
    <li>The Constitution must provide just rights for minorities and people from backward 
        and tribal areas, etc. so that they can be equal participants of social, economic 
        and political justice.</li>
    <li>The Constitution should secure for India, a
due place in the community of nations.
The philosophy of a Constitution consists of
the ideals for which the constitution stands and the policies which the Constitution enjoins upon
the rulers of the Community to follow. The
Constitution of India reflects the impact of our
ideology in the following spheres:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong>Democracy:</strong></div>
         We have borrowed the modern
form of democracy from the West. Under
this system, democracy means the periodic
responsibilities of the Government to go to the people. FOr this purpose; elections
have been held every five-year to elect a Government by the people. However, democracy
covers even the economic and social aspects of life. This aspect of democracy is well
reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy. They are aimed at human welfare, 
co-operation, international brotherhood and so on.</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Secularism:</strong></div>
Secularism is the hallmark of the Indian Constitution. People professing different religions 
have the freedom of religioud worship of their own choice. All the religious have been treated
alike. The fact appreciated in India was that all religions love humanity and uphold truth.
All the social reformers and political leaders of modern Indian have advocated religious 
tolerance, religious freedom and equal respect for all the religions. The very principle has 
been adopted in the constitution of India where all religions enjoy equal respect. However, the 
word  'secularism' was nowhere mentioned in the Constitution as adopted in
1949. The word 'secularism' has now been
added to the Preamble to the Constitution
through the 42nd Amendment passed in
1976.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Socialism:</strong></div>
 Socialism is not new to India.
Vedanta philosophy has socialism in it. The
national struggle for freedom had this aim
also in view. Jawaharlal Nehru referred to
himself as a socialist and republican. Almost
all the parties in India profess to promote
democratic socialism. These principles are
included in the Directive Principles of State
Policy. However, to lay emphasis on this
aspect, the word 'socialism' was specifically
added to the Preamble to the Constitution
through the 42nd Amendment.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Socialism:</strong></div>
Decentralization: India has always practised decentralisation through the
Panchayat system. Mahatma Gandhi also advocated decentralisation. It is on this
account that he is regarded as a philosophical anarchist. We have introduced
the Panchayati Raj system in India to
achieve the objective of decentralisation.
The concept of cottage industries as laid
down in the Directive Principles of State
Policy also refers to decentralisation.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Mixed Economy:</strong></div>
 Co-existence is a salient
feature of our ideology. Co-existence has
manifested itself through a mixed system
of economy. In this system we have allowed both the private and public sectors
of economy to work simultaneously. Large
scale and essential industries have been
put in the public sector.
</li> 
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Humanism:</strong></div>
 Humanism is a salient feature
of Indian ideology. Indian ideology regards
the whole humanity as one big family. It
believes in resolving international disputes
through mutual negotiations. This is what
we find in the Directive Principles of State
Policy. 
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Spiritualism:</strong></div>
 Spiritualism refers to what
inspires and promotes the people to be
their best selves. It creates a feeling of
sacrifice, peace, non-violence, tolerance and
cooperation. It is basic feature of Indian philosophy. We have tried to achieve this through
equality in all spheres of life. This leads to social welfare.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Liberalism:</strong></div>
Liberalism does not refer to the western concept of liberalism. It refers, in the Indian context,
to self government, secularism, nationalism, economic reforms, constitutional approach, and
representative institutions etc. all these concepts were advocated by the modern Indian Leaders.\
All these elements have been incorporated in the Indian Constitution by the virtue of which we 
want to establish a Welfare State in India. Everything has to be achieved through constitutional
means.</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Sarvodaya:</strong></div>
Sarvodaya refers to the welfare of all. It is different from the welfare pf the majority. 
It seeks to achieve the welfare of all without exception.  It is
referred to as Ram Rajya. The concept of
Sarvodaya was developed by Mahatma
Gandhi, Acharya Vinoba Bhave and J..
Narayan under which the material, spiritual, moral and mental developement of  everyone is 
sought to be achieved. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution and
the Directive Principles of State Policy represent this idea.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Gandhism:</strong></div>
Gandhism represents an ethical and moral India. Gandhi set a new example of fighting foreign 
rule through non-violence. He taught the importance of non-violence and truth. He advocated
untouchability, cottage industry, prohibition, adult education and the uplift of villages. 
He wanted a society free of exploitation and decentralised in character. All these Gadhian 
principles have found an honourable place in the Constitution of India.
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">
<div class="subheading"><strong>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'INDIAN'
    AND 'AMERICAN' JUDICIAL REVIEW?
</strong></div>
Based on the principle of Judicial Review, the American Supreme Court has acquired the 
power to so interpret the Constitution that it has come to be known as the third chamber of 
the Constitution, whereas, in India the Supreme Court does not enjoy the power of adding to 
the Constitution but it can only strike down any act or any legislation on the ground that
it is contrary to the basic framework of the Constitution or violative of the procedure 
established by law.
<br>
As the Indian Constitution stands today, the judiciary in India has the right to review 
legislative enactments and executive acta provided they are brought before the courts except 
for a few specific acts like the discretionary powers of the Governers, the privileges and
immunities of the members of the legislatures, etc. In pronouncing its verdict on legislative
acts and executive actions the Supreme Court primarily bases itself on what is known as the 
basic framework of the Constitution-a phrase which has never been spelt out so that others could
know the ingredients that go into the making of the basic frame work of the Constitution.
However, it is clear from the constitution as it is today
that the Parliament has the right to amend the constitution as long as it does not erode the basic frame work
of the constitution. Thus, making additions or deleting
some Articles of the constitution is the power of the
Parliament but not that of the Supreme Court as in the
case of the U.S.

<h3>Fundamental Rights</h3>

The success or failure of a democracy depends largely on the extent to which civil
liberties are enjoyed by the citizens in general.
A democracy aims at the maximum development of the individual's personality, and the
personality of the individual is inseparably 
bound with his liberty. Only a free society can
ensure the all-round progress of its members
which ultimately helps the achievement of
human welfare. Thus, every democracy pays
special attention to securing this bare objective
to the maximum extent without, at the same
time, endangering the security of the state
itself. A common device that is adopted by
most of them for this purpose is to incorporate
a list of fundamental rights in their constitutions and guarantee them from violation by
executive and legislative authorities.
The Indian constitution contains the basic
principle that every individual is entitled to
enjoy certain rights as a human being and the
enjoyment of such rights does not depend upon
the will of any majority or minority. No majority
has the right to abrogate such rights. In fact, the
legitimacy of the majority to rule is derived from
the existence of these rights. These rights include all the basic liberties such as freedom of
speech, movement and association, equality
before law and equal protection of laws, freedom of religious belief and cultural and educational freedoms. The constitution has classified
these rights into seven categories and one of
them is the right to constitutional remedies
which entitles every aggrieved person to approach even the Supreme Court of India to
restore to him any fundamental right that may
have been violated. It is, thus, a basic affirmation of the Constitution that the political system
that it establishes should provide conditions favourable for the maximum development of the 
individual's personality. The farmers of the Constitution were conscious of the fact that in 
the absence of the enjoyment of the above
mentioned rights, such development of the
personality was impossible and democracy
would sound an empty word. Having spent
most of their lives under a foreign rule and
having fought relentlessly for the enjoyment of
these rights by themselves, it was only natural
that they should have wanted to embody them
in the Constitution they framed for the establishment of a democratic political order. They
hoped to build this political order on the firm
foundation of the freedom of political competition. The prime importance of these rights is
that while the will of the majority decides how 
these freedoms are to be implemented, the
existence of the freedoms themselves is not
subject to that will. On the contrary, these
freedoms set the conditions under which the
will of the majority is to be formed and
exercised.
It must be stressed, however, that the fundamental freedoms guaranteed to the individual under the Constitution are not absolute.
Individual rights, however, basic they are, cannot override national security and general welfare.
For, in the absence of natioanl security  and general welfare, individual rights themselves 
are not secure. Freedom of sppech does not
mean freedom to abuse another; freedom of
movement does not mean freedom of physical
attack on others. The Constitution has made
express provisions dealing with such limitations
of fundamental rights so that those who seek to
enjoy the rights may also realise the obligation attending them.

<div class="subheading"><strong>Public and Private Rights</strong></div>

The rights which were thus selected by the
Constituent Assembly fall broadly into two
categories-public and private-but both have the
same purpose in view, namely, to put an end
to arbitrary rule. Among the public or political
rights were the right often to choose their rulers,
the right to hold them responsible for their
conduct, the right to share in law-making and
the right to bear arms. Among the private rights
were the right to personal freedom, the right to
freedom of religious belief, the right to thought
and expression, and the right to quality and to
the possession and use of property.

<div class="subheading"><strong>Right to Equality (Arts. 14,15,16,17 & 18)</strong></div>

Article 14 declares that "the State shall not
deny to any person equality before the law or
equal protection of the laws within the territory
of India". Thus, Article 14 stands for the establishment of a situation under which there is
complete absence of any arbitrary discrimination by the laws themselves or in their administration. The Right to Equality affords protection not only against discriminatory laws passed
by legislatures but also prevents arbitrary discretion being vested in the executive. In the
modern State, the executive is armed with vast powers, in the matter of enforcing bylaws, rules
and regulations as well as in the performance
of a number of other functions. The equality
clause prevents such powers being exercised in
a discriminatory manner.
Article 14 prevents discriminatory practices only by the state and not by individuals.
For instance, if a private employer like the owner of a private business concern discriminates 
in choosing his employees or treats his employees, unequally, the person discriminated against will
have no judicial remedy.
What is the difference between "equality
before the law" & "equal protection of laws"?
The phrase "equality before the law" occurs
in almost all written constitutions that guarantee fundamental rights. Equality before the law
is an expression of English Common Law while
"equal protection of laws": owes its origin to
the American Constitution. Both the phrases
aim to establish what is called the "equality to
status and of opportunity" as embodied in the
Preamble of the Constitution. While equality
before the law is a somewhat negative concept
implying the absence of any special privilege
in favour of any individual and the equal
subjection of all classes to the ordinary law,
equal protection of laws is a more positive
concept employing equality of treatment under
equal circumstances.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE 'JUSTICIABLE' AND 'NONJUSTICIABLE' RIGHTS?</i></strong></div>

The real problem that confronted the framers of Indian Constitution was how to limit their selection of
rights to certain categories only. What rights were fundamental and what are not, and why? If the rights of
life, liberty and property were fundamental, what about
right to employment and education? Has not the traditional concept of fundamental rights in its individualistic setting undergone a change in the modern era of
the welfare State? The framers had no doubt about the
answers to these questions. They were quite conscious
of the change in the character of the modern state.
They knew that the age of the American Bill of Rights
which believed in the "perfectibility of man and the malignancy of Government" had gone for ever. And yet, it
was a task of utmost difficulty. This was because the
State in India was not yet in a position to guarantee the
right to employment or education. It was a matter of
physical impossibility, not the lack of will. Hence, they
divided these rights into two categories, justiciable and
non-justiciable. Justiciable rights are those which can
be enforced by a court of law. Part III of the Constitution
which is entitled "Fundamental Rights" contains justiciable rights like the right of life, liberty and property.
Part IV, "The Directive principles of State Policy, contains non-justiciable rights such as right to employment and education. 
The citizen has no judicial remedy if he is denied the enjoyment of these rights.
</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Prohibition of Discrimination on Certain Grounds (Art. 15)</i></strong></div>

Not content with a merge general declaration of the right to equality, and fully consious
of all types of discrimination prevalent in the country, the farmers of Indian Constitution
went a step further in Article 15, which is more
illustrative in character than introducing anything substantially new. Yet, there is one striking feature in it which brings within its scope,
although in a limited way, the actions of the
private individuals. According to the Article,
"the State shall not discriminate against any
citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste,
sex, place of birth or any of them. Further, on
the basis of any of these grounds a citizen
cannot be denied access to shops, public restaurants or the use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats,
roads and places of public resort maintained
wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated
to the use of the general public."
Article 15 has, however, two notable exceptions in its application. The first of these permits
the State to make special provision for the
benefit of women and children. The second,
allows the State to make any special provision
for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the
Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. The
special treatment noted out to women and
children is in the larger and long range interest
of the community itself. It also recognises the
social customs and background of the country
as a whole. The second exception was not in the
original Constitution but was later on added to
it as a result of the First Amendment of the
Constitution in 1951.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Equality of Opportunity in matters of Public
Employment (Art. 16)</i></strong></div>
Article 16 guarantees equality of opportunity
in matters of public employment. In the first part
of the Article, the general rule is laid down that
there shall be equal opportunity for all citizens,
wherever they are living in matters of employment
under the State, thereby the universality of Indian
citizenship is emphasized. According to this, the
State is prohibited from showing any discrimination
against any citizen on grounds of religion, caste,
race, sex, descent, place of birth or residence. The
next clauses are in the nature of exceptions.
According to the first, residence qualifications
may be made necessary in the case of appointments
under the State for particular positions. But instead
of leaving it to individual States to make any rules
they like in this regard, the power is vested in
Parliament to prescribe the requirement as to
residence within the State. This is intended to
make the qualifying test uniform throughout India.
The second exception is in favour of reservation
of positions in public employment for any
backward class of citizens. This is meant to help
those who had very little share so far in public
employment. The determination of a backward
community is a matter that is left to each State
Government. The third exception seeks to take out
of the scope of the general principle the
management of the affairs of any religious or
denominational institution under any special law
providing for the same.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Abolition of Untouchability (Art. 17)</i></strong></div>

Article 17 abolishes "untouchability" and its
practice in any form is made an offence punishable under the law. No article in the Constitution was adopted with such unanimity and so
great an acclamation and enthusiasm as this article. The custom of untouchability had not only 
thrown millions of Indian population into abysmal gloom and despair, 
shame and
disgrace, but it had also eaten into the very
vitals of the nation. There would be no better
sign of the determination to eradicate the evil
than incorporating this Article into the chapter
on Fundamental Rights in the Constitution.
The Untouchability Offences Act was
amended in 1976 making its penal clauses more
stringent. The Act has been also renamed as the
Protection of Civil Rights Act. One significant
new provision of the Act is that a person
convicted of an untouchability offence will be
disqualified for contesting the elections. It was
for the first time that such a provision became
a law in the history of elections in India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Abolition of Titles (Art. 18)</i></strong></div>

In the creation of a society which seeks to
establish political, social and economic equality
and thereby aspires to become truly democratic,
there is no room for some individuals to hold
titles thus creating artificial distinctions among
members of the same society. Recognition of
titles and the consequent creation of a hierarchy
of aristocracy had been denounced as an antidemocratic practice as early as the eighteenth
century by both the American and the French revolutions. In India, the practice of the British 
Government conferring a number of titles every year mostly on their political supporters and 
Government officers, had already created a
peculiar class of nobility among the people. It
was difficult, on principle, for independent
India to recognise and accept these titles apart
from considerations of the merit of those who
held them. Article 18, therefore, abolished all
titles and the State is prohibited from conferring
titles on any person. The only exception made
to the strict rule of non-recognition of titles is
that provided in favour of academic or military
distinctions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Right to Freedom (Art.19)</i></strong></div>

Personal Liberty is the most fundamental of
fundamental rights. Articles 19 to 22 deal with
different aspects of this basic right. Taken
together, these four articles form a charter of
personal liberties, which provides the backbone
of the chapter on Fundamental Rights. Of
these, Article 19 is the most important and it
may rightly be called the key-article embodying
the "basic freedoms" under the Constitution,
guaranteed to all citizens. These are the rights:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To freedom of speech and expression.</li>
        <li>To assemble peaceably and without arms.</li>
        <li>To form associations or unions;</li>
        <li>To move freely throughout the territory of
India;</li>
        <li>To reside and settle in any part of the
territory of India</li>
        <li>To practice any profession, or to carry on
any occupation, trade or business.
It is impossible to exaggerate the importance
of these freedoms in any democratic society.
Indeed, the very test of a democratic society is</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

the extent to which these freedoms are enjoyed
by the citizens in general. These freedoms as a
whole constitute the liberty of the individual.
What restrictions are put on the freedom of
speech and expression?
There are eight restrictions on the freedom
of speech and expression. These are in respect
of the:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sovereignty and integrity of India</li>
        <li>Security of the State</li>
        <li>Friendly relations with foreign State</li>
        <li>Public order</li>
        <li>Decency or morality</li>
        <li>Contempt of court</li>
        <li>Defamation</li>
        <li>Incitement to violence</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Freedom of the Press</i></strong></div>

There had been much criticism, both within
Constituent Assembly and outside, of the omission of a specific reference to freedom of the
Press and the failure to guarantee it along with
the freedom of speech. The omission was
considered a serious lapse on the part of the
Drafting Committee by the protagonists of "Free
Press" as a separate right. Nevertheless, the
Drafting Committee did not think, it necessary
to incorporate right of this nature in the chapter
of Fundamental Rights.
<br>
Speaking on behalf of the Committee, Dr. Ambedkar said that the Press was merely
an other way of expression of an individual or a
citizen. The press has no special rights which
are not to be given or which are not to be
exercised by the citizen in his individual capacity. The editor of a Press or the managers of the
Press are all citizens and, therefore, when they
choose to write in newspapers, they are merely
exercising their right of expression. Therefore,
no special mention is necessary of the freedom
of the Press. The word "expression" that is used
in Article 19(1) (a) in addition to "speech" is
comprehensive enough to cover the freedom of
Press.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Other rights covered under the Right to
Freedom (Art.19)</i></strong></div>

<b>Right to Assemble [Art. 19 (1) (b) and 19(3)]:</b>
One of the basic protections of free speech
is the right of free assembly. In fact, freedom
of assembly and freedom of speech go hand in
hand. The framers of the Constitution knew
that the right to peaceably assemble, public
debate and discussion, for political activities
and such other purposes was essential to make
the freedom of speech and expression real.
Hence, the constitutional guarantee to assemble peaceably and without arms. The right to assembly 
can be restricted only in the interest of public order and the restrictions ought to be 
reasonable
<br>
<b>Right to Form Associations and Unions
[Art, 19 (1) (c) and 19(4)]:</b> The right guaranteed
to form association or unions is more or less a
charter for all working people in this country.
The right to form associations or union can be
restricted only in the interest of public order or
morality. There can be no association or union
for an illegal or conspiratorial purpose. Nor can
there be an association to further immorality.
The right to form associations or unions however, is not available to every citizen in the same
measure. A member of the public services,
although he is a citizen cannot claim the right
to the extent that a private citizen can. Being
a Government servant, he is bound by his
service rules and he cannot challenge his service
rules on the ground that they stand in his way
of fully enjoying the right to form associations.
<br>
<b>Right to Free Movement and to Residence
[Art. 19(1) (d), (e) and 19 (5)]:</b> The right to move
freely throughout the territory of India, to reside
and settle in any part of it are guaranteed under
sub-clauses (d) and (e) respectively of clause (1)
of Article 19. The importance of the freedom
of movement and residence cannot be exaggerated. In fact, the enjoyment of the freedoms
guaranteed under the other rights depends
largely on the freedom of movement unhampered and uncircumscribed. The state's power
to place reasonable restrictions of these freedoms is limited.
Freedom of Profession, Occupation, Trade
or Business [Art 19 (1) (g) and 19 (6)]: Article
19 (1) (g) guarantees the freedom to practice
any profession or to carry on any occupation,
trade or business. A doubt was expressed in the
Constituent Assembly whether these were fundamental rights at all. 
Perhaps the only other
Constitutions which have given them the status
of fundamental rights are those of Ireland and
Switzerland. It seems that the framers of the
Indian Constitution had been influenced by the
complex social system that prevailed in India, in
seeking to guarantee rights such as these. It has
been the bane of India's social life that professions were inherited rather than acquired. A
society dominated by Caste, and professions
based upon Caste or religion, have little to offer
for the building up of a community enlivened
by social mobility and dynamism. Such a
society is often intolerant to persons who change
the traditional professions of their ancestors and
is eager to maintain a petrified social order. A
constitutional guarantee of the right to take up
the profession, calling, trade or business of one's
choice is indeed a significant aid to the building
up of a dynamic and democratic society.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences (Art-20)</i></strong></div>

Article 20, affords protection against arbitrary and excessive punishment to any person
who commits an offence. There are four such
guaranteed protections:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        A person can be convicted of an offence only
if he has violated a law in force at the time
when he is alleged to have committed the
offence;
        </li>
        <li>
            No person can be subjected to greater penalty than what might have been given to 
            him under the law that was prevalent when he committed the offence;
        </li>
        <li>
            No person can be prosecuted and punished
for the same offence more than once. 
        </li>
        <li>
        No person accused of an offence can be
compelled to be a witness against himself.
        </li>
    
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Protection of Life and Peronal Liberty (Art-21)</i></strong></div>

Article 21, is one of the shortest in the
constitution over which there took place one of
the longest and most through going discussions
in the Constituent Assembly. It enacts that no
person shall be deprived of his life or personal
liberty except according to procedure established by law.
Article 21, gives protection to life and personal liberty to the extent therein mentioned. It
does not recognise the right to life and personal
liberty as an absolute right but limits the scope
of the right itself. The absolute right is, by the
definition in the article, qualified by the risk of
its being taken away in accordance with the
procedure established by law. It is this circumscribed right which is substantively protected by
Article 21, as against the executive as well as the
legislature,, for the Constitution has conditioned
its deprivation by the necessity for a procedure established by law made by the legislature. 
While sub-clauses 2 to 6 of Article 19 have put a limit on the fundamental right of a citizen, 
Article 21 along with Article 22 puts a limit on
the power of the State given under Article 246,
read with the legislative lists. Under the Constitution, life and personal liberty are balanced
by restrictions on the rights of the citizens as laid
down in Article 19, and by the checks put upon
the State by Article 21 and 22.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Right to Education (Art-21 A)</i></strong></div>

This right was inserted in the list of fundamental rights by the 86th Amendment Act, 2002. It
provides that the State shall provide free and
compulsory education to all children of the age of
six to fourteen years in such manner as the State
may, by law, determine.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Protection against Arrest and Detention (Art - 22)</i></strong></div>

Article 22 guarantees three rights. First, it
guarantees the right of every person who is
arrested to be informed of the cause of his arrest,
secondly, his right to consult, and to be defended by a lawyer of his choice. Thirdly, every
person arrested and detained in custody shall be
produced before the nearest Magistrate within
a period of twenty-four hours and shall be kept
in continued custody only with his authority.
All these rights are without any qualifications
and are, therefore, in absolute terms.
There are however two exceptions to the
universal application of the rights guaranteed
under the first two clauses of Article 22. These
relate to.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Any person who is an enemy alien, or</li>
        <li>Any person who is arrested or detained under
any law providing for preventive detention.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

India owned freedom from foreign rule as a
result of great sacrifices by thousands of patriots.
Many of them died in British jails in the course
of the struggle for independence, many others
spent years of their lives in prison. Naturally,
freedom and liberty are gift too precious to all of
them who lived to see India free. And they
wanted to safe guard these rights and facilitate
their enjoyment as best as possible. Against this
background it is easy to understand and appreciate the deep rooted feeling against what happened to be personal freedom during the emergency. At the same time, it must be remembered
that democratic freedom in India is still too
young and tender a plant to be capable of
defending itself easily against overt or covert
onslaughts that may be directed against it by
elements which have no regard either for democratic liberties or orderly progress. Vigilance is
still required to protect the country's hard won
freedom and national unity from forces of subversion and violent revolution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Right against Exploitation (Art. 23 & 24)</i></strong></div>

Article 23 and 24 deal with the right against
exploitation. Article 23 which prohibits traffic
in human beings and beggar; and similar forms
of forced labour. This provision in Indian Constitution is comparable to the Thirteenth Amendment of the American Constitution abolishing
slavery or involuntary servitude. At the time of
the adoption of the Constitution there was hardly anything like slavery or the widespread practice 
of forced labour in any part of India. The National Freedom Movement since the
twentieth century had been a rallying force
against such practices. However, there were
many areas of the country where "untouchables" were being exploited in several ways by
the higher castes and richer classes.
According to Article 24, no child below the
age of 14 years shall be employed to work in any
factory or mine or engaged in any other hazardous employment. This Article is now intimately
related to a Fundamental Rights as well as
Fundamental Duties which call upon the State
to enforce Universal Compulsory and Free Primary Education to all children in the country up
to the age of 14 years. This comes of the
realisation that children should prepare during
this period for the task of the future as useful 
and responsible citizens. Employment of children is an uncivilized and even inhuman practice. It is exploitation. It stunts their growth,
corrupts their moral fibre and often drives them
to delinquency. Naturally, it must be prohibited
and incentives to divert them from employment
should be provided.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Right to Freedom of Religion (Articles 25
to 28)</i></strong></div>
It is a paradox that while almost every religion stands for and preaches the universal 
brotherhood of man; religion has been a constant source of conflict in human history. The
idea of guaranteed fundamental rights itself
was a device directed towards the avoidance of
such a contingency. The right to freedom of
speech and expression, and the right to form
associations and unions are also rights which
guarantee religious speech and expression and
the right to form religious associations and
unions. But the Constituent Assembly was not
satisfied with such provisions alone in its bid to
infuse complete confidence in the religious minorities. It went a step further and adopted a
separate group of articles dealing solely with the
right of freedom of religion. The freedoms
provided in Articles 25, 26, 27, and 28 are
conceived in most generous terms to the complete satisfaction of religious minorities.
Article 26, is in fact, a corollary to Article 25
and guarantees the freedom to manage religious
affairs. According to this, every religious denomination is given the right (a) to establish
and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, (b) to manage its own affairs in
matters of religion, (c) to own and acquire
movable and immovable property, and (d) to
administer such property in accordance with
law. Article 27 provides an additional protection to religious activity by exempting funds
appropriated towards the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion from the
payment of taxes.
It further may be noted that the provisions
of the Indian Constitution regarding the right to
religious liberty cover all the freedoms relating
to religion set forth in the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, which was adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations at the
Palais de Chaillot, Paris, on December 10, 1948.
This document states, "Everyone has the right
to freedom of though, conscience and religion,
this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom either alone or in
community with others and in public or private,
to manifest his religion or belief in teaching,
practice, worship and observance." Since the
UN General Assembly has proclaimed this Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all
nations, Indians may well be proud that at least
in the matter of religious freedom their Constitution represents a world ideal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTIONS ON THE
FREEDOM OF RELIGION?</i></strong></div>

Although the freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 25 of Indian Constitution is wide in scope, it is far
from being absolute. It is subject to public order, morality and health, and to the other provision of Part III of
the Constitution Article 25(1). This freedom also shall
not affect the operation of any existing law, or prevent
the State from making any law:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        regulating or restricting any economic, financial,
political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice, and
        </li>
        <li>
        regulating for social welfare and reform or the
throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Other provisions related to Secularism</i></strong></div>

In conformity with the principle of the
Secular State, the Constitution of India establishes a single common citizenship. The State
shall not discriminate against any citizen on
grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place
of birth or any of them Article 15(1). In particulae, no citizen shall, on grounds only of 
religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability,  
restriction
or condition with regard to : (a) access to
shops, public restaurants, hotels and places of
public entertainment, or (b) the use of wells,
tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of
public resort maintained wholly or partly out
of State funds or dedicated to the use of the
general public Article 15 (2). The educational
facilities provided by the State are to be enjoyed equally by all the citizens. No citizen
shall be denied admission into any educational
institution funded by the State or receiving aid
out of State funds on grounds only of religion,
race, caster, language or any of them [Article
29 (2)].

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cultural and Educational Rights (Articles 29 and 30)</i>
</strong></div>

Under Article 29 and 30, certain cultural and
educational rights are guaranteed. Section (1) of
Article 29, guarantees the right of any section of the
citizen residing in any part of the country having
a distinct language, script or culture of its own, to
conserve the same. Section (2) prohibits any
discrimination based only on religion, race, caste,
language or any of them in the matter of admission
to State or State-aided educational institutions.
Section (1) of Article 30 provides that "all minorities, whatever based on religion or 
language, shall have the right to establish and
administer educational institutions of their
choice". According to section (2) the State shall
not, in granting aid to educational institutions,
discriminate against any educational institution
on the ground that it is under the management
of minority community, whether based on religion or language.
Article 30 is a charter of educational rights.
It guarantees in absolute terms the right of
linguistic and religious minorities to establish
and administer educational institutions of their
choice and, at the same time, claim grants-in-aid
without any discrimination based upon religion
or language. The fact that the Constitution does
not impose any express restriction in the scope
of the enjoyment of this right, unlike most of the
rights included in the chapter on Fundamental
Rights, shows that the framers intended to make
its scope unfettered. This does not, however,
mean that the State cannot impose reasonable
restrictions of the regulatory character for maintaining standards of education. This point has
been made abundantly clear in judicial pronouncements.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Special significance of Religious,
Educational and Cultural Rights</i></strong></div>

Taking the right guaranteed under religious,
educational and cultural fields as a whole, it
must be noted that these are couched in the
most comprehensive language, and the maximum possible freedom is guaranteed to the
minorities, religious and linguistic. The special
significance of these provisions is that while the
impact of other rights in Part-III of the Constitution is on the people of India as a whole,
irrespective of religion, caste, race, or language,
that of these rights is only on the minorities.
The democratic basis of the Constitution would
be lost if the minorities were not given adequate
protection to preserve their religious believes,
and institutions of education and culture, the
Constitution may then be branded as an instrument for the furtherance of the majority community and the language of the majority.
Naturally, resentment against such a position
would manifest all over the country. Moreover,
such a position would have discredited the
foundation of the national movement against
foreign rule, in which every religious and linguistic minority in India was represented and
solemn promises had been made by representative of the majority community to safeguard the
legitimate interests of the minorities against all
forms of tyranny in a free India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Right to Constitutional Remedies (Art. 32)</i></strong></div>

A declaration of fundamental rights is meaningless unless there is an effective machinery for
the enforcement of the rights. Hence the framers of the Constitution were in favour of adopting special provisions guaranteeing the right to
constitutional remedies. This, again, is in tune
with the nature in general of the various provisions embodied in the chapter on Fundamental 
Rights. Article 32 has four sections.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The first ection is general in scope and says that "the right to move the Supreme Court
by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is
guaranteed".</li>
        <li>The second section deals, in more specific
terms, with the power of the Supreme Court
to issue writs including writs in the nature
of habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition,
quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of any of the rights.</li>
        <li>The third section empowers Parliament to
confer the power of issuing writs or orders
on any other court without prejudice to the
power of the Supreme Court in this respect.
So far, Parliament has not passed any law
conferring the power of issuing writs on any
courts.</li>
        <li>The last section deals with the conditions
under which this right can be suspended.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
As the guardian of fundamental rights the
Supreme Court has two types of jurisdiction,
original and appellate. Under its original jurisdiction, any person who complains that his
fundamental rights have been violated within
the territory of India may move the Supreme
Court seeking an appropriate remedy. The fact
that they may have a remedy in any of the High Courts does not preclude him from going directly 
to the Supreme Court.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Writs</i></strong></div>
    <b>Habeas corpus-</b>'You may have the body'
(a person unlawfully detained is sought to be set
at liberty)
<b>Mandamus:</b> 'We order' (commanding a
person or a body to do that which it is his, or
its duty)
<b>Prohibition:</b> Issued primarily to prevent an
inferior court from exceeding its jurisdiction
Certiorari: Orders the removal of a suit from
an inferior court to a superior court
Quo warranto: Restrains a person from
acting in a office to which he is not entitled

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Habeas Corpus</i></strong></div>

Habeas corpus is a Latin term which literally
means "You may have the body". Under the
law of England, as a result of long usage, the
term came to signify a prerogative writ, a
remedy with which a person unlawfully detained is sought to be set at liberty. It is
mentioned as early as the fourteenth century in
England and was formalized in the Habeas
corpus Act of 1679. The privilege of the use of
this writ was regarded as a foundation of
human freedom and the British citizen insisted
upon the privilege wherever he went whether
for business or colonization. This is how it found
a place in the Constitution of the United States
when the British colonies in America won their
independence and established a new State under
that Constitution.
In India, under the Constitution, the power
to issue writ of habeas corpus is vested only in
the Supreme Court and High Courts. The writ
is a direction of the Court to a person who is
detaining another, commanding him to bring the
body of the person in his custody at a specified
time to a specified place for a specified purpose.
A writ of habeas corpus has only one purpose: to set at liberty a person who is confined
without legal justification; to secure release from
confinement of a person unlawfully detained.
The writ does not punish the wrong-doer. If the
detention is proved unlawful, the person who
secures liberty through the writ may proceed
against the wrong - doer in any appropriate
manner. The writ is issued not only against
authorities of the State but also to private individuals or organisations if necessary

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mandamus</i></strong></div>

The Latin word 'mandamus' means 'we order'. The writ of 'mandamus' is an order of the
High Court or the Supreme Court commanding
a person or a body to do that which it is his, or
its duty to do. Usually, it is an order directing
the performance of ministerial acts. A ministerial
act is one which a person or body is obliged by
law to perform under given circumstances. For
instance, a licensing officer is obliged to issue a
license to an applicant if the latter fulfills all the
conditions laid down for the issue of such license.
Similarly, an appointing authority should issue a
letter of appointment to a candidate if all the
formalities of selection are over and if the candidate is declared fit for the appointment. But
despite the fulfillment of such conditions, if the
officer or the authority concerned refuses or fails to issue the appointment letter, the aggrieved 
person has a right to seek the remedy through a writ of 'mandamus'. There are three essential
conditions for the issue of writ of 'mandamus'.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        First, the applicant must show that he has
a real and special interest in the subject
matter and a specific legal right to enforce.
        </li>
        <li>
        Secondly, he must show that there resides in him
a legal right to the performance sought, and;
        </li>
        <li>
        Finally, that there is no other equally effective, convenient and beneficial remedy.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Prohibition</i></strong></div>

A writ of prohibition is issued primarily to
prevent an inferior court from exceeding its
jurisdiction or acting contrary to the rule of
natural justice, for example, to restrain a judge from hearing a case in which he is personally
interested. The term 'inferior courts' comprehends special tribunals, commissions, magistrates and officers who exercise judicial powers,
affecting the property or right of the citizen and
act in a summary way or in a new course
different from the common law. It is well
established that the writ lies only against a body
exercising public functions of a judicial or quasi
-judicial character and cannot in the nature of
things be utilised to restrain legislative powers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Certiorari</i></strong></div>

Certiorari is an ancient prerogative writ which oreder the removal of a suit from an
inferior court to a superior court. It may be used
before a trial to prevent an excess or abuse of
jurisdiction and to remove the case for trial to a
higher court. It is invoked also after trial to quash
an order which has been without jurisdiction or
in defiance of the rules of natural justice.
Often a writ of Certiorari is sought along
with prohibition, so that not merely may an
invalid act be reviewed by a superior court
(certiorari), but its operation may also be restrained (prohibition). While prohibition and
certiorari are so intimately related to each other,
prohibition is the converse of mandamus. The
former is invoked to prevent a court or other
authority form doing something which it has
not the power to do, while the latter is called
in aid to require it to do something which it is
bound to do.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Quo Warranto</i></strong></div>

The writ of quo warranto is a common law
process of great antiquity. According to this,
the High Courts or the Supreme Court may
grant an injuction to restrain a person from
acting in a office to which he is not entitled and
may also declare the office to be vacant. What
the court has to consider in an application for
a writ of quo warranto is whether there has
been usurpation of an office of a public nature
and office is substantive in character, i.e., office
independent in title. It is a remedy given by law
at the discretion of the Court and is not issued
as a matter of course. An application for the
issue of a writ of quo warranto is maintainable
only in respect of offices of public nature which
are the creation of statute and not against
private institutions.

<h3>Vice President of India</h3>

The Constitution provides for a Vice-President whose role in the Government is comparatively
insignificant. Going through the provisions dealing with his office, one can easily see a striking
similarity between the role of the Vice-President
of India and that of his counter part in the United
States. The American Vice-President is sometimes
called "His Superfluous Highness" to characterise
his comparative insignificance in the administration. But, there is a provision in the American
Constitution which makes the Vice-President
potentially important. According to this, if the
President dies in office, or is removed from office,
the Vice-President takes over the President's office
and continues in that capacity for the full length
of the unexpired term. But, under the India
Constitution, if the President dies or resigned or
is otherwise incapacitated and, as a result, the
Presidential office become vacant, the Vice-President will act as President only for a maximum
period of six months.
<br>
The main function of the Vice-President like
that of his American prototype is to preside over
the Council of States. He is its ex-officio Chairman. The Vice-President takes over the office of
the President normally, under four situations:
death of the President, resignation of the President, removal of the President from his office
through impeachment or otherwise, and finally,
when the President is unable to discharge his
functions owing to absence, illness or any other
cause,. The last of these clearly provides for any
temporary period of incapacity which makes
the President incapable of discharging his responsibilities.
During the period, when the Vice-President
is acting for the President, he will have all the
powers and immunities of the President. He
is also entitled for such salary and allowances
and privileges as may be determined by Parliament by law for the purpose. At present,
according to the Second Schedule of the Constitution, the Vice-President is entitled to the
same emoluments, allowances and privileges as
the President while he discharges the functions
of, or is acting as the President.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HOW THE VICE PRESIDENT IS ELECTED? WHAT
ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED?</i></strong></div>

The Vice-President is elected by the members of
both Houses of Parliament at joint meeting. The election is conducted in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote. The voting is by secret ballot.
 Any Indian citizen who has completed the age of 35
years and who is qualified for election as a member of
the Council of States is eligible for election as VicePresident. But no person who holds an office of profit
under the Government of India or any State or local or
other authority in India is eligible for the purpose. The
Vice-President cannot be a member of either House of
Parliament or a member of any State Legislature.
</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Removal of the Vice-President</i></strong></div>

The Vice-President can be removed from
office by a resolution of the Council of States
passed by a majority of all the then members of
the Council and agreed to by the House of the
People. But, this procedure does not seem to be sufficient, if at the time such removal is sought,
 the Vice-President is acting for the President. If he is to be removed 
from office while he acts
in the latter capacity, the provisions ought to be
exactly the same as are applicable to the impeachment of the President.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functions of the Vice-President</i></strong></div>

The Vice-President is the highest dignitary of
India, coming next after the President. No
functions are, however, attached to the office of
the Vice-President as such. The normal function
of the Vice-President is to act as the ex-officio
Chairman of the Council of States. But if there
occurs any vacancy in the office of the President
by reason of his death, resignation, removal or
otherwise, the Vice-President shall act as President until a new President is elected and enters
upon his office [Art. 65(1)].
The Vice-President shall discharge the function of the President during the temporary
absence of the President, illness or any other
cause by reason of which he is unable to
discharge his functions [Art. 65(2)]. No machinery having been prescribed by the Constitution
to determine when the President is unable to
discharge his duties owing to absence from
India or a like cause, it becomes a somewhat
delicate matter as to who should move in the
matter on any particular occasion. It is to be noted that this provision of the Constitution 
has not been put into use prior to 20th June, 1960,
though President, Dr. Rajendra Prasad had
been absent from India for a considerable period
during his foreign tour in the year 1958. It was
during the 15-days visit of Dr. Rajendra Prasad
to the Soviet Union in June 1960, that for the
first time, the Vice-President, Dr. Radhakrishnan
was given the opportunity of acting as the
President owing to the 'inability' of the President
to discharge his duties.
The second occasion took place in May,
1961, when President Rajendra Prasad became
seriously ill and incapable of discharging his
functions. After a few days of crisis, the President himself suggested that the Vice-President
should discharge the functions of the President
until he resumed his duties. It appears that the
power to determine when the President is unable to discharge his duties or when he should
resume his duties has been understood to belong
to the President himself. In the even of occurrence of vacancy in the office of both the
President and the Vice - President by reason of
death, resignation, removal etc. the Chief justice
of India or in his absence the senior most judge
of the Supreme Court available shall discharge
the functions until a new President is elected. In
1969 when on the death of Dr. Zakir Hussain,
the Vice-President Shri V.V. Giri resigned; the
Chief Justice Shri Hidayatullah discharged the
functions.
When the Vice-President acts as, or discharges the functions of the President, he shall
cease to perform the duties of the Chairman of
the council of States and then the Deputy Chairman of the Council of States shall act as its
chairman and he (Deputy Chairman) will get the
salary of the Chairman of the Council of States.
Doubts and disputes relating to or connected with the election of President or VicePresident
Determination of doubts and disputes relating to the election of a President or VicePresident is dealt with in Art 71, as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li> Such disputes shall be decided by the Supreme Court whose jurisdiction 
            shall be exclusive and final.</li>
            <li>No such dispute can be raised on the ground
of any vacancy in the Electoral College
which elected the President or Vice-President.</li>
            <li>If the election of a President or the VicePresident is declared void by the Supreme
Court, acts done buy him prior to the date
of such decision of the Supreme Court shall
not be invalidated.</li>
            <li>Barring the decision of such disputes, other
matters relating to the election of President
or Vice-President may be regulated by law
made by Parliament.</li>

<h3>Council of Ministers</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cardinal Principles of Parliamentary

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Head of state is not the real executive. For
all practical purpose Prime Minister is the
real executive who is the head of the government.</li>
        <li>He along with his Council of Ministers is accountable to the Lower House of the

        <li>Council of Ministers is drawn from

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Formation of Council of Ministers</i></strong></div>

Council of Ministers is formed as soon as
Prime Minister is sworn in. PM alone can
constitute Council of Ministers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Categories of Ministers</i></strong></div>

Constitution does not categorize members
of the Council of Ministers. It is done by the Prime
Minister following the British conventions. In fact,
there are three categories of ministers in India.
But it is the prerogative of PM to decide how
many categories to be included. These three
categories of ministers are as follows:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cabinet Ministers -</b>They are senior rank
ministers if allotted a portfolio. They always head
a ministry. They constitute the cabinet and enjoy
the right to attend cabinet meeting. They are
assisted by Minister of State or Deputy in
discharging official functions.</li>
<li><b>Minister of States-</b>They are second rank ministers. They are normally not given 
independent charge. They assist Cabinet Ministers. PM in his discretion can give 
independent change to Minister of States. He does
not enjoy right to attend cabinet meeting. But he
can be invited to attend cabinet meetings.</li>

<li><b>Deputy Ministers -</b>They are junior in rank.
They are never given independent charges. They
cannot be invited to participate in the cabinet
meeting.</li>  
<li><b>Parliamentary Secretaries -</b>They are not
member of CoM. They are appointed by PM.
Basically; they are Member of Parliament and
from the ruling party. They are appointed to
assist the ministry in discharging functions in the
Parliament. They take oath of office and secrecy
conducted by PM.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Strength of Council of Ministers</i></strong></div>

91st Amendment Act 2003 amended Art. 75
and inserted Art 75 (1A) which provides that
“strength of Union CoM shall not exceed 15% of
the total strength of the Lok Sabha.

<h3>Cabinet VS Council Of
Ministers</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Council of Ministers</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It is a composite body because it contains
Cabinet Ministers, Minister of State and
Deputy Minister</li>
        <li>It is a large body and rarely meets as a
composite body.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cabinet</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It includes only Cabinet Ministers.</li>
        <li>It is a body within Council of Ministers.</li>
        <li>It meets regularly and deliberates & takes
policy decision including proposed
legislation.</li>
        <li>It is the highest decision making body of the
country that runs administration.</li>
        <li>Decisions of cabinet automatically become
that of Council of Ministers.</li>
        <li>Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Home
Minister and Defence Minister always remain
part of the cabinet.</li>       
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Collective Responsibility of CoM</i></strong></div>

Art 75 (3) of the Constitution provides for
collective responsibility of CoM to the Lower
House of the Parliament. Collective responsibility
of CoM to the Lok Sabha means that they enjoy
the majority support of the House. If any decision
of CoM is defeated in Lok Sabha, decision may
pertain to a single ministry but entire CoM shall
have to resign.
It means each and every decision taken by
the government is collectively approved by the
Cabinet. Generally, it becomes the collective
decision of the CoM and all ministers defend it
both within & outside the Parliament. If a
decision taken by an individual minister is
defeated in the Lok Sabha, before it was
collectively approved by the cabinet then the
individual minister has to resign and not the
whole CoM. Thus, CoM stands or falls together or sinks or wims together.
Collective responsibilty ensures that there is no difference in CoM once a collective decision
has been taken. There may be differences of
opinions in the cabinet at the time of deliberation
of policy issue but once a collective decision has
been taken then all the ministers shall endorse
collective decision. Ministers don't have
individual opinion contrary to collective decision
that he can express within or outside the
Parliament. If a minister has a contrary view to
collective decision then he has to change his view
and support the collective decision or resign. He
can't oppose the collective decision and at the
same time continue to be a member of the CoM.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Individual Responsibility of Ministers</i></strong></div>

Under Article 75 (2) of the Constitution,
ministers are also individually responsible to the
President. This means ministers hold office during
the pleasure of the President. They can be
removed from CoM without assigning any
reason. However, they can only be removed after
PM advised the President to do so.
Article 75 (2) - The Ministers shall hold office
during the pleasure of the President.
<br>
Individual responsibility is essential to enforce collective Responsiblity of CoM. For example, 
minister disagrees collective decision but refuses to resign. In that case PM may advice the 
President to drop the minister so as to assure collective responsibility of CoM.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Position of the Prime Minister</i></strong></div>
Prime Minister is described as primus inter
pares (first among equals). Also called interstellar
minories (little moon among stars). He is the
"Keystone of The Cabinet Arch”. Prime Minister
is generally a Member of Parliament and elected
according to the same procedure similar to all
MPs. He is PM only because he is the leader of
the majority party in the Lok Sabha.
However, in actual practice, he is more than
his colleagues. Under Article 74, Council of
Minister, is headed by PM. When PM resigns or
dies, entire CoM goes out of office. But when an
individual minister resigns or dies there is only
vacancy in CoM. Besides PM alone can constitute
CoM but without PM, CoM can't exist and
function. Thus he is central to the survival &
death of CoM.
It is the PM who selects members of CoM
and distribute portfolio among them. He can
reshuffle CoM the way he likes. It is PM who coordinates the functions of various ministries. He
alone enjoys right to call for files or information
from any ministry to other ministry.
PM convenes the cabinet meeting and
decides on the agenda of such meetings. He also
gives general direction for the administration of
the country. He is the chief spokesman of CoM
both in & outside the Parliament. It is his
prerogative to announce important policy
decisions. 

He is also the link between the President and
CoM. Ministers individually can also call upon
the President but not as a matter of right. It is
the PM who periodically calls upon the President
and apprises him about administration of the
country. PM is also the chief link between CoM
and the Parliament. He can participate in any
issue relating to any ministry during discussion
held in Parliament. A minister normally
participates on issues relating to his own
ministry.

<h3>Attorney General of India</h3>

The Attorney-General of India is the first
Law Officer of the Government of India. The
Attorney-General is appointed by the President
and he holds office during the pleasure of the
President. In order to be appointed as the
Attorney General of India, a person must have
qualified to be appointed as a Judge of the
Supreme Court.
Though the Attorney - General of India is
not (as in England) a member of the Cabinet, he
shall also have the right to speak in the Houses
of Parliament or in any Committee thereof, but
shall have no right to vote [Art. 88]. By virtue
of his office, he is entitled to the privileges of a
member of parliament [Art. 105(4)]. In the
performance of his official duties, the AttorneyGeneral shall have a right of audience in all
Courts in the territory of India. He represents
the Union & the States before the courts but is
also allowed to take up private practice provided the other party is not the state. Because
of this he is not paid salary but a retainer to be
determined by the president. In England, the
Attorney-General is a member of the cabinet but
in India he is not. It is a political appointment,
and therefore, whenever there is a change in the
party in power, the Attorney - General resigns
form his past to enable the new government to
appoint a nominee of its choice. The Attorney
- General is assisted by two Solicitors - General
and four Additional Solicitors - General. The
Attorney - General gets a retainer equivalent to
the salary of a judge of the Supreme Court.

<h3>Comptroller and Auditor -
General of India</h3>

The Comptroller and Auditor General of
India is appointed by the President. He holds
office until he attains the age of sixty five years
or at the expiry of the six-year term, whichever
is earlier. He is the guardian of the public purse.
His duties are to keep the accounts of the Union
and the States and to ensure that nothing is
spent out of the Consolidated Fund of India or
of the States without the sanction of the Parliament or the respective State Legislatures. He
submits an audit report of the Union to the
President who shall lay it before the Parliament
and the audit reports of the States to the
respective Governors who shall lay it before the
respective state Legislatures. In case of Union
Territories, the Comptroller and Auditor-General submits audit reports to Lt. Governors where
the Union territories have Legislative Assemblies
of their own. The accounts of the other Union
Territories are audited by him as part of the
account of the Union of India.
As observed by Ambedkar, the Comptroller
and Auditor-General of India shall be the "most
important officer under the Constitution of
India". For, he is to be the guardian of the public 
purse and it is his duty to see that not a farthing
is spent out of the Consolidated Fund of India
or of a State without the authority of the
appropriate Legislature. In short, he shall be the
impartial head of the audit and accounts system
of India. In order to discharge this duty property, it is highly essential that this office should
be independent of any control of the executive.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Position of the CAG</i></strong></div>

The independence of the Comptroller and Auditor-General has been sought to be secured by
the following provisions of the Constitution ---
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Though appointed by the President, the
Comptroller and Auditor-General may be
removed only on an address from both
Houses of Parliament, on the grounds of (i)
'proved misbehaviour', or (ii) 'incapacity'.
He is thus excepted from the general rule that
all civil servants of the Union hold their office
at the pleasure of the President [Art. 310 (1)].</li>
<li>His salary and conditions of service shall not
be liable to variation to his disadvantages
during his term of office. Under this power,
Parliament has enacted the Comptroller
and Auditor-General's (Conditions of Service) Act 1971 
which, as amended, provides as follows;</li>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The term of office of the Comptroller and
Auditor-General shall be 6 years from the
date on which he assumes office. But---
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>He shall vacate office on attaining the
age 65 years, if earlier than the expiry
of the 6-year term;</li>
        <li>He may, at any time, resign his office,
by writing under his hand, addressed to
the President of India;</li>
        <li>He may be removed by impeachment
[Arts. 148(1); 124(4)]</li>
</ul>
</ol></li>
<li>
His salary shall be equal to that of a judge
of the Supreme Court.
</li>
<li>On retirement, he shall be eligible to an
annual pension of Rs. 15,000.</li>
<li>
In other matters, his conditions of service
shall be determined by the Rules applicable
to a member of the I.A.S., holding the rank
of a Secretary to the Government of India.
</li>
<li>
He shall be disqualified for any further
Government 'office' after retirement - so that
he shall have no inducement to please the
Executive of the Union or of any State.
</li>
<li>
The salaries, etc., of the Comptroller and
Auditor-General and his staff and the
administrative expenses of his office shall
be charged upon the Consolidated Fund
of India and shall thus be non-votable
[Art. 148].
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Duties of CAG</i></strong></div>

The Comptroller and Auditor-General shall
perform such duties and exercise such powers in relation to the accounts of the Union and 
the States as may be prescribed Parliament. In exercise of this power, Parliament
has enacted the Comptroller and Auditor
General's (Duties Powers and Conditions of
Service) Act, 1971, which, as amended in
1976, relieves him of his pre-Constitution
duty to compile the accounts of the Union;
and the States may enact similar legislation
with the prior approval of the President,- to
separate accounts from audit also at the State
level, and to relieve the Comptroller and
Auditor-General of his responsibility in the
matter of preparation of accounts, either of
the States or of the Union.
Provisions of this Act relating to the duties
of the Comptroller and Auditor-General are---
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To audit and report on all expenditure from
the Consolidated Fund of India and of each
State and each Union Territory having a

<h3>The Parliament</h3>


Union legislature is called the Parliament
which is bicameral including the Lok Sabha and
the Rajya Sabha, i.e. lower and upper house
respectively. The Lok Sabha is inclusive of the
members directly elected by the people and
Rajya Sabha represents the States of Indian
Federation. Bicameralism was resorted to with
a view that there should be parity between the
direct representatives of the people and the
representation of the States from where they
were coming.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Lok Sabha</i></strong></div>

The Lok Sabha is the popular chamber of
the Indian Parliament with a maximum strength
of 545 members and this is so from the Thirty
-first Amendment onwards when it was increased from 525 members to 545 members
body. Of the total members, not more than 525
represent states and 20 is the number of seats
reserved for Union Territories. Another provision is of two members to be nominated by the
President from Anglo -Indian communities, if in
the President's opinion, it does not have a fair
representation in the Lok Sabha. The election
of the members of Lok Sabha is out of the predivided constituencies and while demarcating
them the two guide lines have been followed,
i.e. there is uniformity of representation between the States and between the different
constituencies in the State. With this regard, the
States have been allotted seats and its population is, as far as practical the same for all States.
Also, the number of people residing in one
constituency, as far as possible, hold similar
within a State. The forty-second Amendment
has laid down that 1971 census will serve as the
basis of allocation of seats to each State and this
will remain so till 2000 A.D. Recently, the Union
Cabinet has extended this cap upto 2026 AD.
This also puts a halt on gerrymandering i.e.
altering the boundary of constituencies of vested
interest.
The term of Lok Sabha is for five years.
However, it can be dissolved earlier. On the
other hand, the term of Lok Sabha can be
increased in a situation of emergency. The
convention is of Lok Sabha meeting not less
than twice every year and there must not be gap
between two meeting exceeding six months.
The time of meeting is decided by the President,
who also has the choice of venue where the
meeting can be held. The President also enjoys the power to dissolve or prorgue the House.
The quorum of meeting to be held is in tenth of the total strength of the house.
A person to be able for contesting election
for the membership of Lok Sabha must not be
less than 25 years of age and should not hold
a position of profit.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Rajya Sabha</i></strong></div>

The Rajya Sabha consists of a maximum of
250 members including members nominated as
well as elected. The number of elected members
is not to exceed 238 representing the States and
the Union Territories. The President nominates
12 members having exceptional qualities and
experiences in diverse fields like art, literature,
science, and social service. India Upper House
is different from the U.S. counterpart as this
House is not functioning truly for giving balanced representation to the smaller States. The
members are elected indirectly by the members
of the Legislative Assemblies of the States in
accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable
vote.
The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body and
cannot be dissolved. However, one-third of the
members retire at the end of every second year.
This way the members enjoy a six-years term in
the House.
A member must have the basic requirement
of being an Indian and not less than 30 years
of age. The member must also not hold any
office of profit, if he is chosen. If a member
remains absent from the House for more than
60 days, the seat may be declared vacant

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functions of The Parliament</i></strong></div>

The functions and the powers of the Parliament are extensive and appear in Constitution at different places. The Parliament has
extensive power to make laws on the items
given in the Union List as well as in the
Concurrent List. The items included in the
Union List include Defence, External Affairs,
Communications, Currency, Citizenship etc.
These are the items whose uniformity across the
length and breadth of the country is essential for
the solid foundation of the national existence.
The Concurrent List includes items such as
marriage, divorce, trade, criminal law procedure, etc. These are the items on which uniformity is desirable but not essential. The powers
of the Parliament are far reaching as it can also
legislate on the matters included in the State
List. However, as enshrined in Article 249, a
prior approval of the Upper House is essential
for the purpose. Article 250 mentions that the
Parliament can legislate for the whole or any
part of India or any matter mentioned in the
State List during the period of Emergency. The
Parliament also holds the power to elect and
impeach the President and Vice-President of
India. The Parliament can also impeach the
judges of Supreme Court and High Courts on
grounds of incapacity.
Financial Functions: The Parliament has a
special function to have a grip on the finances
of the country. No tax can be levied or money
can be spent without the consent of the Parliament. It has one exception as the expenditure
of Consolidated Fund of India is not put to vote
of the Parliament. The financial business of
Parliament is complex and parliament can not
devote time and energies for the purpose of
satisfactory discharges of responsibility of financial control. Thus financial committees have
been set-up to enable Parliament to discharge
this function efficiently. The committees for the
purpose include Estimates Committee, the Public Accounts committee and the Committee on
Public Undertakings. The Estimates Committee
suggests economics in expenditure in various
departmens of Government. The Public Accounts Committee examines the appropriation
accounts in the light of audit report of the
Auditor General of India and draws attention
of the Parliament to the irregularity, if any. The
Committee on Public Undertakings examines
the working of the public undertakings established by the working and powers of these
committees.
<b>Amendment of the Constitution:</b> Amending
the Constitution is another major function of the
Parliament. There has been controversy regarding the power of Parliament with regard to
access to any part of the Constitution for amendment purpose. Various judgements of Supreme
Court have put a restriction on the unlimited
amending power of the Parliament for amendment purpose. The Parliament in no way can amend the Constitution that it affects adversely
the basic structure of the Constitution, however,
is ambiguous and not spelt out in the constitution
and the judiciary this way has arranged for
immense power so as to decide from time to time
if legislation by the Parliament is adversely affecting the Constitution or not.

<b>Control over Executive:</b> The performance of
the Parliament with regard to control on executive is enormous. The Council of Ministers is
collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha and
must resign in case a 'no confidence motion' is
passed aganist the Minister. Individually, the Ministers are responsible for the proper 
working of the Ministers under their charge and collectively for the general policies of the Government. The Parliament through procedures provided by the House like asking questions, calling
attentions, adjournment motions, etc, keeps a
constant vigil on the working of the administration and the lapses of the Government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliamentary Privileges and Immunities</i></strong></div>


Parliamentary privileges i.e. exceptional right
or advantages are granted to the members of
legislatures all over the world. Thus, in most of
the democratic countries, the legislatures and
their members enjoy certain privileges so as to
function effectively. Privilege though part of the
law of the land, is to a certain extent an
exemption from the ordinary law. It would not
be wrong to say that privilege is to Parliament
what prerogative is to the Crown. Just as
prerogatives can be exercised by the Crown
without help or hindrance from Parliament or
the judges, the privileges can be exercised by the
House of the Parliament without help or hindrance from the judges.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Prerogative vs. Privilege</i></strong></div>

Prerogative is the authority of the Crown
whereas privilege is the discretionary authority
of each House of Parliament. Privilege is an
ancillary power which is essential to maintain
the authority of the legislature, and the functions, privileges and disciplinary powers of a
legislative body are closely connected. However, the distinction between privileges and
functions is not always clear, and it is convenient to retain the term 'privilege' to signify
certain fundamental rights of the legislature
which are generally accepted as necessary for
the exercise of its constitutional functions. The
privileges are the necessary complement of the
functions, and disciplinary powers of the legislature. The privileges of a legislative assembly
would be 'entirely in effectual to enable it to
discharge its functions, if it had no power to
punish offender, to impose disciplinary regulations upon its members, or to enforce obedience
to its commands. Thus, necessity is the justification for the privileges of Parliament.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Privilege</i></strong></div>

Some of the privileges of Parliament, and of its
members and committees, are specified in the
Constitution and there are certain statutes and the
rules of procedure of the House; others continue
to be based on the precedents of the House of
Commons. These privileges are available to all the
legislatures in the states as well. The main articles
of the Constitution of India dealing with the
privileges of Parliament are 105 and 122 and the
corresponding articles for the states are 194 and
212. Article 105(1) of the COnstitution of India provides that, subject to the provisions of the
Constitution and the rules and standing orders
regulating the procedure of Parliament, there
would be freedom of speech in the Parliament.
Clause 2 of the Article provides that no member
of Parliament would be liable to any proceedings
against him in any court in respect of anything
said or any vote given by him in Parliament or any
committee thereof, and that no person would be
liable in respect of the publication of any report,
paper votes or proceedings by or under the
authority or either House of Parliament. Clause
3 ordains that in other respects the powers,
privileges and immunities of each House of
Parliament, and of the members and committees
thereof, would be such as may from time to time
be defined by the Parliament by law, until so defined, would be those of the House of the 
Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and of
its members and committees, at the commencement of the Constitution of India. According
to clause of this article, the provisions of clauses
1,2, and 3 would apply to persons who by
virtue of the Constitution have the right to
speak in or take part in the proceedings of a
House of Parliament or a committee thereof,
as they apply to the members of Parliament.

which question asked by the members are answered by the Minister. The different types of
questions are -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Starred Question :</b> It is one for which an
oral answer is required to be given by the
Minister on the floor of the House. Supplementary question may be asked based on the
Minister's reply. The Speaker decides if a
question should be answered orally or otherwise. One member can ask only one
starred question in a day.</li>
<li><b>Unstarred Question :</b> It is one for which the
Minister lays on the table a written answer.
A ten day notice has to be given to ask such
question and no supplementary questions
can be asked with regard to such questions.</li>
<li><b>Short Notice Question:</b> This type of question which can be asked by members on
matters of public importance of an urgent
nature. It is for the speaker to decide whether
the matter is of urgent nature or not. The
member has also to state reasons for asking
the question while serving notice.</li>
<li>Cut Motions : A motion that seeks reduction in the amount of a demand presented
by the govt. in known as a cut motion. Such
motions are admitted at the speakers discretion. It is a device through which members
can drawn the attention of the government
to a specific grievance or problem. There are
three types of cut motions-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Disapproval of policy cut- which is to express disapproval of the policy 
       underlying a particular demand, says that "the amount of the demand be 
       reduced to Re. 1".</li>
       <li>Economy cut asks for a reduction of the amount
of the demand by a specific amount. The aim
is to affect economy in the expenditure.</li>
<li>Token cut is a device to ventilate specific
grievances within the sphere of the
government's responsibility. The grievance
has to be specified. Usually, the motion is in
the form, "The amount of the demand be
reduced by Rs. 100".
<b>Adjournment Motion:</b> It is motion to adjourn the proceeding of the House so as to take
up for discussion some matter of urgent public
importance. Any member can move the motion
and if more than 50 members support the
demand, the speaker grants permission for the
motion. The notice for such a motion has to be
given before the commencement of the sitting
on that day.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Calling Attention Motion:</b> With prior permission of the speaker; a member may call the
attention of a Minister to any matter of urgent
public importance. The Minister may make a
brief statement regarding the matter or ask for
time to make a statement.

<b>Privilege Motion:</b> It is motion moved by a
member if he feels that a minister has committed
a breach of privilege of the House or of any one
or more of its members by with holding facts of
a case or by giving a disorted version of acts.

<b>Points of Order:</b> A member may rise a point of order 
if the proceedings of the House do not allow the rules. The presiding officer
decides whether the points of order raised by
the member should be allowed.
<b>Vote on account:</b> As there is usually gap
between the presentation of the budget and its
approval, the vote an account enables the govt.
to draw some amount from the consolidated
fund of India to meet the expenses in the
intervening period.
<b>Guillotine:</b> On the last of the allotted days
at the appointed time, the speaker puts every
question necessary to dispose off all the outstanding matters in connection with the demands for grants. This is known as guillotine.
The guillotine concludes the discussion and
demands for grants.
<b>Quorum:</b> It is the minimum number of
members whose presence is essential to transact
the business of the House. Article 100 provides
the quorum of either House shall be one tenth
of the total number of members of the House.
<b>Censure Motion:</b> It is differs from a noconfidence motion in that the latter does not
specify any ground on which it is based, while
the former has to mention the charges against the
govt. for which it is being moved. A censure
motion can be moved against the council of
Minister or an individual minister for failing to
act or for some policy. Reason for the censure
must be precisely inumerated. The speaker decides whether or not the motion is in order and
no leave of the House is required for moving it.
The govt. may at its discretion fix a date for the
disucssion of the motion. If the motion is passed
in the Lok Sabha the council of Minister is
expected to resign

<h3>The Speaker</h3>

The House of the people is presided over by
the Speaker who is elected by the House from
among its own members. The office of the
Speaker has been held in great esteem throughout the history of over three hundred years of
Parliamentary Government in Britain. This is
because of the manner in which he has discharged his responsibilities as a presiding officer; the detachment and objectivity which he
brought to bear upon all his decision, that the
framers of Indian Constitution were quite conscious of this role of impartiality of the Speaker
is evident from the provisions in the Constitution that deal with the office of the Speaker. For
instance, Article 94 (c) provides for the removal
of the Speaker by a resolution of the House
passed by a majority of all the then members
of the House. Removal of officers from their
position in this manner, namely, by such special
resolutions and by such special majorities is
restricted to only a few officers such as the
President, the Vice-President, the Presiding
Officers of both House of Parliament, Judges of
the Supreme Court, etc, as these officers are
expected to discharge their responsibilities without political and party considerations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What is the significance of the office of
Speaker?</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The importance of the office of the Speaker
can be seen also from the functions that he
performs and the powers that he exercises.</li>
<li>He presides over the meetings of the House.</li>
<li>He adjourns the House or suspends its meeting if there is no quorum.</li>
<li>While questions are decided in the House, he
is not entitled to vote in the first instance
(which emphasizes his impartiality) but he
shall exercise a casting vote in case of a tie.</li>
<li>Any member of the House who resigns his
office should address his letter of resignation
to the Speaker.</li>
<li>The decision of the Speaker as to whether or
not a Bill is a money bill shall be final. The
Speaker will have to endorse or certify it
before such a Bill is transmitted to the Council of States or presented to the President for
his assent.</li>
<li>He will be consulted along with the Chairman of the Council of States by the President
while making rules of procedure with respect to joint sittings of the two House. In
such sittings it is the Speaker's right to
preside.</li>
<li>In conformity with the Speaker's power to
conduct the business of the House, he is
empowered to allow any member to speak
in his mother tongue, if he cannot adequately express himself either in Hindi or English</li>
<li>With respect to the discharge of his powers
and functions, the Speaker is not answerable
to anyone except the House.</li>
<li>No court of law can go into the merits of a
ruling given by the Speaker.
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Additional functions of the Speaker.</i></strong></div>

In addition to the constitutional provisions,
the Rules of Procedure of the House confer upon
the Speaker a variety of powers in the detailed
conduct of the business of the House. Under
these:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>His decision to admit notices of questions,
motions, resolutions, bills, amendments, etc.
is final.</li>
<li>There are certain guiding principles which
the Rules of Procedure lay down for determining the admissibility of notices of motions, etc. The interpretation of these rules
as well as their application to specific situations and circumstances is the prerogative
of the Speaker.</li>
<li>He is the sole authority for giving priority or
urgency to a matter so that it may be placed
before the House in the national interest.</li>
<li>He is not expected to give reasons for his
decisions which cannot be challenged by
any member.</li>
<li>His powers to maintain discipline in the
House and to conduct its proceedings in
accordance with the rules are formidable.</li>
<li>Similarly his powers in connection with the
Constitution as well as the working of Parliamentary Committees also are enormous.</li>
<li>The Speaker is thus the guardian and custodian of the rights and privileges of the
members, both in their individual capacity
and on the group or party basis.</li>
<li>The Speaker, in short, is the representative of the
House in its powers, proceedings and dignity.
A special feature of the Speaker's office is that
even when the House is dissolved, the Speaker does
not vacate his office. He will continue in office until
a new Speaker is elected when the new House
meets. Parliament is empowered to fix the salary
and allowances of the Speaker and these are
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>The Deputy Speaker</h3>

The Deputy Speaker who presides over the
House in the absence of the Speaker is elected
in the same manner in which the Speaker is
elected by the House. He can be removed from
office also in the same manner. When he sits
in the seat of the Speaker, he has all the powers
of the Speaker and can perform all his functions. One of his special privileges is that when
he is appointed as a member of a Parliamentary
Committee, he automatically becomes its Chairman. By virtue of the office that he holds, he
has a right to be present at any meeting of any
Committee if he so chooses and can preside over
its deliberations. His rulings are generally final
in any case, so far as they are related to the
matter under discussion, but the Speaker may
give guidance in the interest of uniformity in
practice. Whenever the Deputy Speaker is in
doubt, he reserves the matter for the ruling of
the Speaker.
The Deputy Speaker, however, is otherwise
like any ordinary member when the speaker presides over the House. He may speak like
any other member, maintain his party affiliation
and vote on propositions before the House as
any ordinary member. The Deputy Speaker is
entitled to a regular salary.

<h3>Chairman and Deputy
Chairman of The Council of
States</h3>

While presiding officers of the House of the
People are called the Speaker and the Deputy
Speaker, their opposite officers in the Council of
States are called the Chairman and the Deputy
Chairman respectively. The Vice-President of
India is the ex-officio Chairman of the Council
of States. As the presiding officer of the Rajya
Sabha his functions and powers are the same as
those of the Speaker. He is however not a
member of the House.
In the absence of the Chairman, the Council
is presided over by the Deputy Chairman. He
is a member of the House and is elected by the
members of the House. When he ceases to be a
member of the Council, he automatically vacates
the office of the Deputy Chairman. He can
resign his office by writing to the Chairman. He
may be removed from his office by a resolution
passed by a majority of all the then member of
the Council. The Deputy Chairman is empowered to discharge 
all the functions and to perform all duties whenever Chairman's office 
is vacant or when the Vice-President officer of the Council he is also given 
a regular salary and other allowances that Parliament by
law has fixed. The Council of States also has a
panel of members, called Vice-Chairman, nominated by the Chairman for the purpose of presiding over the House in the absence of both the
Chairman and the Deputy Chairman. The
Secretariat of the Rajya Sabha is headed by a
Secretary who discharges the same functions as
his counterpart in the Lok Sabha 


<h3>The Governor</h3>

The Constitution of India has provided for
parliamentary system of Government in which
the executive head at the Centre is the President. Likewise, at the State level there is a
provision for an institution of the Governor,
who enjoy the same status as the President at
the Centre. The Governor is appointed by the
President and his tenure is of five years. As a
matter of convention, the Chief Minister is
consulted before the appointment of Governor
for a particular State whose domicile is also of
another State - another convention. The Governor must have the basic qualifications of being
an Indian citizen and over the age of 35 years.
The Governor enjoys protection against legal
proceedings in the court of law as provided
under Article 361. He is not answerable to the
Court of Law for the exercise and performance
of powers and duties of his office or for any act
done or purporting to be done in the exercise or
performance of his powers and duties. The
Governor shall also not to be the member of the
legislature either the Centre or at the State. If
a member of a legislature is appointed as Governor, he shall be deemed to have vacated his
seat in the legislature on the date of assumption
of his office as Governor. The Governor also
does not hold any office of profit. The Governor
can resign and can be removed from his office by
the President before the expiry of the term and
there are many examples in our country when
large number of Governors have been called back
after the change of party in power at the Centre.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Powers of the Governor</i></strong></div>

The Governor enjoys various powers as he
is the chief executive authority at the State level.
All the executive actions in the State are taken
in his name. Also:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>He makes rules for the transaction of business of the 
            Government and for the allocation of work among the Ministers.</li>
            <li>The Chief Minister is appointed by the Governor and the Council of Ministers hold
office at the pleasure of the Governor.</li>
<li> The Governor has the right to be informed
of the transaction of business by the Council
of Ministers.</li>
<li>He appoints officials such as Advocate
General, Chairman and members of Public
Service Commission and Vice-Chancellors
for the State University.
Article 356, which is much in debate, has given power to the Governor to recommend 
to the president if a situation of emergency
has arisen in the State.</li>
<li>After the declaration of emergency, the
Governor takes the full responsibility of administration of the State and as a representative of the Centre, he carries out the
functions.</li>
<li>The Governor has the power to summon
and prorogue the State Legislature and also
to dissolve the legislative assembly at any
time. In fact, legislature is summoned and
prorogued on the advice of Chief Minister.</li>
<li>The Governor can also independently summon the legislature only in instances when
the Chief Minister seems to deliberately evading constitutional obligations.</li>
<li>The first session of the State legislature, after
the general elections, and its first session of a calendar year, is opened by the Governor.</li>
<li>He can also withhold or return the bill to
legislature for consideration</li>
<li>He also hold important power to hold the
bill for President's consultation.</li>
<li>The Governor also has the power to nominate
about one-sixth of the Legislative Council
members form among the persons having
special knowledge in different fields.</li>
<li>A Money Bill cannot be introduced in the state legislative without the prior approval
of the Governor.</li>
<li>The Contingency Fund of the State is also at
the disposal of the Governor and he can use
it for meeting unforeseen expenditures
pending any authorization by the State
Legislature.</li>
<li>The Governor is also consulted by the
President in matters relating to the appointment of Judges of the High Court of the
State.</li>
<li>The Governor also has the power to decide
on matters relating to appointment, posting
and promotion of district judges and judicial
officers.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


It seems that the Governor enjoys a large
number of powers and has all chances to dictate
his term on the Council of Ministers. In fact, the
discretionary powers of Governor are given to
meet extraordinary situations and not to be used
in day -to- day functioning of the State. The
concept of discretionary powers of the Governor
has been taken from the Government of India
Act 1935. The discretion such as appointment
of Chief Minister, dismissing the Council of
Ministers, summoning and dissolving the legislative assembly, reserving a bill for President's
consideration, invoking Article 356, in fact,
make this institution very strong. However, as
the Governor acts on the advice of the Centre
and has the constant threat of being called back,
he is; in fact, never free to use them at his will.
   

<h3>discretionary Powers of the
Governor in India</h3>

The entire administration of the State is
carried out in the name of the Governor but
practically the real authority is exercised by the
Council of Ministers. During the normal circumstances, Governor acts according to the
advice of his Council of Ministers. However,
Constitution has also vested the Governor with
certain discretionary powers, which he can use
without the aid and advice of the Council of
Ministers or in other words, in the discharge of
these functions the Governor concerned is not
bound to seek or accept the advice of his
Council of Ministers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sixth Schedule:</i></strong></div>
Para nine of 6th schedule is related to the
licences or leases for the purpose of prospecting

"such share of the royalties accruing each year
from licences or leases for the purpose of prospecting for or extraction of minerals guaranteed
by the government of the State in respect of any
area within an autonomous District as may be
agreed upon between the government of the
State and the District Council of such District
shall be made over to that District Council. It
further provides that if any dispute arises as to
the share of such royalties to be made over to
a District Council, it shall be referred to the
Governor for determination and the amount

shall be deemed to be final.</li>
<li> 
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Article 371:</i></strong></div>

Article 371 of the Constitution provides that
the President may confer special responsibilities
upon the Governor with respect to the State of
Maharashtra and Gujarat for the establishment
of separate Development Boards for Vidarbha,
Marathwada, Saurashtra, Kutch and the rest of
Gujarat with the provision that a report on the
working of each of these Boards will be placed
each year before the State Legislative Assembly.


<b>Article 371 A</b> of the Constitution has conferred special responsibilities on the Governor of
Nagaland for certain purposes. The Governor
after consulting his Council of Ministers, shall
exercise his individual judgement as to the action
to be taken. These responsibilities are: with respect
to law and order so long as internal disturbances
occur in some areas of that State; to establish a
Regional Council for Tuensang District; to arrange
for equitable allocation of money between Tuensang
District and the rest of Nagaland.
<b>Article 371 C</b> of the Constitution confers
special responsibilities upon the Governor of Manipur to secure the proper 
functioning of a Committee of the members of the legislative
Assembly consisting of the members representing the Hill Area.
<b>Article 371 F (g)</b> of the Constitution confers
special responsibilities upon the Governor of
Sikkim for peace and for an equitable arrangement for ensuring the social and economic
advancement of different sections of the population of Sikkim.
<b>Article 371H (a)</b> of the Constitution confers
special responsibilities upon the Governor of
Arunachal Pradesh with respect to law and
order in the State of Arunachal Pradesh.
However, the Sarkaria Commission recommended that "before taking a final decision in
the exercise of his discretion, it is advisable that
the Governor should, if feasible consult his
Ministers even in such matters, which relate
essentially to the administration of a State".
Such a practice will be conducive to the maintenance of healthy relations between the Governor and his Council of Ministers.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Appointment the Chief Minister</i></strong></div>

Governor uses his discretion in the appointment of the Chief Minister, where after the

Similarly, if after the death or resignation of the
Chief Minister on any political ground or after

any party or group is not in majority, the
Governor may appoint such person as the Chief
Minister to whom he thinks fit.</li>

than twelve in any case.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Relationship between Governor and CoM</i></strong></div>

Like the relationship of President with his

his CoM. Governor generally acts according to
the advice of his Council of Ministers. He has
the right to be informed about the running of
administration by the Chief Minister (Art.167).
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Governor has the power to dismiss an
individual Minister at any time.</li>
        <li>He can dismiss a Council of Ministers of the

<h3>Advocate-General</h3>

Each State shall have an Advocate-General

The state legislature consists of the Governor
and one or two houses. The Constitution provides that where there are two Houses in a
State, one shall be known as the Legislative
Council or Vidhan Parishads (Upper House),
and the other as the Legislative Assembly or
Vidhan Sabha (Lower House). Where there is
only one House, it shall be known as the
Legislative Assembly (Article 168).
<div><b>How many States in India have a bicameral Legislature?</b></div>

At present, Legislative Council exist in six
Indian states:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Bihar</li>
        <li>Maharashtra</li>
        <li>Karnataka</li>
        <li>Uttar Pradesh</li>
        <li>Jammu & Kashmir</li>
        <li>Andhra Pradesh</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Andhra Pradesh abolished its upper house
in 1984 but again set up a new Legislative
Council following the elections in 2007.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Upper House</i></strong></div>

When the Constitution came into force on 26
January, 1950, provision was made in Article
168 for having two houses of legislature in six
states, namely, Bihar, Bombay, Madras, Punjab,
Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Article 169
states that the Parliament may by law provide
for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a
state having such a council or for the creation
of such a council in a state having no such
council, if the Legislative Assembly of the state
passes a resolution to that effect by a majority
of the total membership of the Assembly and by
a majority of not less than two third of the
members of the Assembly present and voting.
In India, bicameral legislature is in 6 of the
28 states. The question whether the Upper
House in the states have their utility is debatable. 
The arguments in support of these institutions may be summed up as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the Upper House gives representation to
the special interests in the state,</li>
        <li>it functions as a revising chamber,</li>
        <li>it is a safeguard against hasty legislation by
the Lower House,</li>
        <li>it consists of seasoned and experienced people;</li>
        <li>it has made valuable suggestions on matters of public importance during debates in
the House, which are profitably utilised by
the Government in the implementation of
its policies and programme.
The critics of the bicameral system point out
that the upper chamber is
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>a superfluous institution and a burden on
the public exchequer;</li>
        <li>it has not made any significant contribution as
a revising chamber or as a delaying chamber;</li>
        <li>there is repetition of various matters that
are raised in the Lower House;</li>
        <li>it has no power to vote demands for grants
or to amend Money Bills and certain
categories of Financial Bills;</li>
        <li>22 out of 28 states have only one chamber
i.e., Legislative Assembly and the absence
of the Upper House has not adversely
affected the governance of those states,</li>
        <li>Three of the states (Madras, Punjab and
West Bengal) chose to abolish their Legislative Council within a few years of its
existence; and</li>
        <li>the members defeated in elections to the
Lower House are often brought in as
members of the Upper House.
It is clear from the scheme of the Constitution set out in Articles 168 and 169 that
there is no mandate under the constitution
for having the bicameral system in the
states. The founders of the Constitution
provided for upper houses in only those
state which succeeded to the existing provinces under the 1935 Constitution passed
by the British Parliament. For the States
newly created by the Constitution no provision for Upper House is made. Accordingly, the erstwhile states of Bombay,
Madras, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar,
and West Bengal had originally Upper
House but three of them voluntarily opted
for their abolition.

to that of a graduate of such University,</li>
<li>as nearly as may be, one-twelfth shall be
elected by electorates consisting of persons
who have been for at least three years
engaged in teaching in such educational
institutions within the state not lower in
standard than that of Secondary School,
as may be prescribed or under any law
made by Parliament</li>
<li>as nearly as may be, one third shall be
elected by the members of the Legislative
Assembly of the state from amongst persons
who are not member of the Assembly; and</li>
        <li>the remainder shall be nominated by the
Governor from among persons having special knowledge or practical experience in
respect of matters such as literature, science,, art, co-operative movement and
social service.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Powers of Legislative Councils</i></strong></div>

As regards its powers, the Legislative Council
plays a more advisory role. A Bill, other than a
Money Bill, may originate in either House of the
Legislature. Over legislative matters it has only a
suspensive veto for a maximum period of 4 months. Over financial matters, it powers 
are not absolute. A money bill originates only in the
Assembly and the Council may detain it only for
a period of fourteen days. As in the case of the
Parliament at the Centre, there is no provision for
a joint sitting of both the Houses of the States
Legislature to resolve a deadlock between them,
over legislative matters, if any. Thus, the Legislative Council is only a subordinate component
of the State Legislature.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Arguments in favour of Legislative Council</i></strong></div>


The supporters of these Upper Houses of
State Legislatures advance strong arguments.
They feel that these Houses must be retained in
the national interest. In favour of these Houses,
it is said that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In India the Lower Houses are constituted
on the basis of universal adult franchise.
There are no voting qualifications based on
education and property. In the Lower House,
both the literate as well as illiterate vote on
political considerations. It is argued out that
in case democracy is to be saved from the
caprice of uneducated persons, it is essential
that there should be Upper House.</li>
<li>Another argument advanced is that in every
state there are people who have excelled in
certain walks of life. The nation must take
advantage of their abilities and capabilities.
But these persons have no interest in contesting elections. Their services can best be
utilised only with the help of Vidhan
Parishads.</li>
<li>It is also argued that the very fact that there
is another House, creates a very sobering
effect on the Lower House, which does not
feel tempted to pass a bill either in haste or under the influence of some momentary
impulses. In case any half cooked measure
comes up then at least Upper House points
that out to the duly elected representatives of
the people, leaving to them to accept the
suggestion or not. In other words, it points
out gravity of problems and suggests solution
but does not very much care whether suggestions have been accepted or not.</li>
<li> Another utility of the Legislative Council is
that minority communities in every state can
be given representation in this House. Such
representation is likely to keep them very
much happy and satisfied. Similarly, the
services of experienced persons who do not
wish to contest elections can also be used in
this House.</li>
<li>Legislative work everywhere has much increased and it is becoming impossible for a
single House to handle it efficiently. So some
non-money bills or less controversial matters
can be introduced in the Upper House and
in this way pressure of work in the Lower
House is considerably reduced. This is always a welcome relief for the Lower House.</li>
<li>It is accepted that law making process has
become time consuming and sufficient time
is taken by each House before a bill becomes
an Act. It is also accepted that during this
time, the people get an opportunity to
express their view point. But when the bill
goes to the Upper House, the people are bit
more clear as to what is going to be passed.
Moreover, this time interval is always a
welcome because during this period the
people can express themselves and if need be
changes can even now be introduced.</li>
<li>It is also argued that Upper House does not
stand in any way againist the determination
of the duly elected representatives of the
people. All that they do is that they point out
certain drawbacks and shortcomings, which
should always be welcome. These Houses
can serve very useful purpose in case all
political parties return there men of eminence who have long and varied experience
of life and maintain a good position in
society. If they are the people with the
strength of character and also capacity to render service to the society, they can do a
lot of good to the society. Only those should
be nominated who enjoy high reputation for
their qualities of head and heart and a
spotless life career.</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT EFFECT THE 44TH AMENDMENT HAD ON 
    THE PRESIDENT
</i></strong></div>
Arguments against Legislative Council

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In view of inherent weaknesses of Vidhan
Parishads (Legislative Councils), some critics
are of the view that these should be abolished.
According to them, in case Parishad agrees
with what is passed by the Assembly then it
is simply a superfluous House. In case, it does
not then it will be characterized as a mischievous. 
House and will be charged as citadel of
reaction standing on the way of policies and
programme of duly elected House.</li>
<li>Another criticism levied against this House
is that it is no check on the Assembly. A
money bill can be delayed only for a period
of 14 days, which is very insufficient period
for the members to express their view point.
Even in the case of non-money bills, it can
only delay a bill for a period of 4 months and
if the Assembly is bent upon passing a
measure no efforts on the part of the Parishad
can check it.</li>
<li>The Council of Ministers also does not much
fear from it because a vote of no confidence
does not have any effect for the Ministry.</li>
<li>It is also argued that the Parishads are usually
not even progressive. These have no directly
elected elements. Some of the members are
nominated ones. Their composition is such
that these are not supposed to know public
sentiments. Thus, the House is characterised
as reactionary and conservative.</li>
<li>It is argued that in these Houses scholarly or
literary or social workers are not nominated.
Instead, this chamber is used for providing
berth to defeated politicians or those active
party workers who somehow or other could
not be accommodated in the Assembly or
dissidents in the party to avoid party frictions. In other words, the Upper Houses
neither represent any caste, class or section
of society but only vested interests. All
elections or nominations are made on party
basis and these chambers are only for increasing party interests and influences.</li>
<li>A usual argument is that since these chambers do not serve much useful purpose,
therefore, their maintenance is not worth
the cost which the nation is required to pay
for its upkeep and by way of salaries, allowances and other expenses of the members.
In case Parishads are abolished the tax payer
will be much saved and the money saved
can be used for other useful purposes, including economic development.</li>
<li> The very fact that only six States have
retained Vidhan Parishad proves that bicameralism is not a very popular institution in
India in the states. Moreover, practical experience has shown that those states which
have no Legislative Councils are in no way
doing work less efficiently than the other
states. In case, the Councils had been doing
very useful work, then the other states must
have gone for it.</li>
<li>Then it is not clear to whom the Parishads
represent. In case it is said that in it the
teachers, and graduates are to be given
representation, along with those who are
engaged in the promotion of co-operative
work, then why only these vocations and
why not other very important vocations and
occupations. In case it is felt that in that
those who have excelled in any walk of state
life, should be given representation, then
why nomination has been kept at only 1/
6th. It should have been kept much higher.</li>
<li>It is presumed that in this House there will
be calm and serene atmosphere, where every problem will be discussed in a passionless atmosphere because the elders have held
out no promises to the people at the time of
their election. But again this is not true
because in the Upper House also political
considerations very much weigh with the
members. Each member votes more or less
on party lines and it is said that an Upper
House is just extension of the Lower House,
in so far as political parties are concerned.
There is also no calm atmosphere in these
Houses. The elders quite often quarrel with
each other and do not provide much needed
calmness.</li>
<li>According to some thinkers, Upper Houses
are necessary because these give sufficient time to the people to express their views.
According to them when a bill is traveling
from the Assembly to the Parishad, the
people come to know what is going to be
passed. Intervening time can be utilised for
expressing opinion by the public and in
case there are strong reservations, the bill
can be modified as well. But again this is
not correct because the time taken in passing each bill in one House and stages
through which it passes are so many that
the people have sufficient time to express
themselves, through press and platform.
On this ground also, the Upper Houses
have no utility.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

To conclude, the Upper Houses of State
Legislatures are likely to remain under criticisms, in case these are used for providing berth
to defeated politicians so that they can become
Chief Ministers or Ministers by becoming a
member of either House of legislature. Politicians must take the responsibility to firmly
establish the prestige of these constitutional
institutions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Lower House</i></strong></div>

The Legislative Assembly consists of not
more than 500 and not less than 60 members
chosen by direct election form territorial constituencies in the state. For the purpose of
election, each state shall be divided into territorial constituencies in such manner that the ratio
between the population of each constituency
and the number of seats allotted to it, as far as
practicable, be throughout the state. At the end
ot each decennial Census, the constituencies
will be recasted to make the necessary adjustments to meet the variation in population.
Thus, the members of the Legislative Assembly are elected on the basis of universal adult
franchise without any consideration of caste,
creed and religion. There is, however, a provision for safeguarding the interests of scheduled
castes and scheduled tribes and Anglo Indian
community. Some constituencies are reserved
for Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe and
members belonging to these community can be
elected from them. There is a provision in the
constitution that when the Governor of a State 
feels that the Anglo-Indian community has not
been given proper representation, he can nominate a fixed number of members belonging to
that community in the State Assembly. The
members of the Legislative Assembly are entitled to receive such salaries and allowances as
may from time to time be determined by the
legislature by law.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functions and Powers of the Legislative
Assembly</i></strong></div>

The Legislative Assembly is popular and
more powerful chamber of the State Legislature.
Assembly has the following important functions
and power:
<ol>
<ul>
<li>It can make laws on any subject provided
in the State List. It can also make a law
on a subject of the Concurrent List in case
it is not in conflict with a law already
made by the Parliament.</li>
<li>It has control over the Council of Ministers. Its members may ask questions from
the minister, introduce resolutions or
motions, and may pass a vote of censure
to dismiss the government. The Ministry
is collectively responsible to the Assembly.
The defeat of the Ministry in the Assembly
amounts to the passing of a vote of no
confidence against it.</li>
<li>It controls the finances of the state. A
money bill can originate in the Assembly
and it is taken as passed by the Legislative
Council after a lapse of 14 days after
reference made to it by the Assembly. It
may pass, reject the demands or reduce
their amount implying adoption or rejection of the budget and thereby victory or
defeat of the government. Thus, no tax
can be imposed or withdrawn without the
approval of the Legislative Assembly.</li>
<li>It has constituent powers too. According
to Article 368, a bill of constitutional
amendment first passed by the Parliament
shall be referred to the states for ratification. It is here that the Assembly has its
role to play. It has to give its verdict by
passing a resolution by its simple majority
showing approval or disapproval of the
said bill.</li>
<li>It is also provided that the President shall
refer to the Assembly of the concerned
state a bill desiring alteration in its territory for eliciting its views in this regard
before he recommends that such a bill be
introduced in the Parliament.</li>
<li>The Assembly also elects its own Speaker
and Deputy Speaker and may remove
them by a vote of no confidence. It takes
part in the election of the President of
India. It consider reports submitted by
various independent agencies like the State
Public Service Commission, Auditor-General, and others.</li>
</ul>
</ol> 

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Speaker of Legislative Assembly</i></strong></div>

Every Legislative Assembly chooses two
members of the Assembly to be the Speaker and
the Deputy Speaker respectively whenever these
offices become vacant. They vacate their offices
if they cease to be the members of the Assembly.
The Speaker or the Deputy Speaker as the case
may be resigns his office by writing to the
Deputy Speaker in the case of the Speaker and
to the Speaker in the case of the Deputy
Speaker. They may be removed from office by
a resolution of the Assembly passed by a majority of all the then members of the Assembly. No
resolution for the purpose of the removal of the
Speaker or the Deputy Speaker is moved unless
at least 14 day notice is given of the intention
to move such a resolution. While any resolution
for the removal of the Speaker from the office
is under consideration, the Speaker though he
is present, will not preside over such a meeting.
The Presiding Officers are paid such salaries
and allowances as are prescribed by the Legislature of the State by law. The main characteristics of this high office are dignity, independence and impartiality. The legislature is the
pivot of a democratic system of Government
and the Speaker is the pivot of the parliamentary machinery. He is vested with powers to
ensure orderly discussion in the House, to enforce the rules of procedure, to control disorder
and to take disciplinary action against members
indulging in unruly behaviour.
The Presiding Officer should stand above
party strife and away from stormy state politics
to be able to command respect of all groups. 
Viewed in this perspective, one can appreciate
the step taken by N. Sanjeeva Raddy, when he
was Speaker of the Lok Sabha, who resigned
from the Party to which he belonged. But most
of the Speakers at the State did not severe their
party connections. Some of them even joined
the Ministries by resigning their office of Speaker
and Deputy speaker. Persons who have ministerial ambitions cannot be expected to be completely impartial and free from party politics.
The Speaker has not always lived upto these
principles and in certain states they have acted
in a patently partisan manner.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What are the Qualifications and Terms of
the members of State Legislatures?</i></strong></div>

No person can be a member of both Houses
of the State Legislature at the same time. Person
holding office of profit under the Union or the
State Government and persons convicted by the
Court of election malpractices or other crimes
are also not eligible for membership of the
Legislature. A person is not qualified to become
a member of the Legislature unless he is a citizen
of India and makes and subscribes before some
person authorised in that behalf by the Election
Commission an oath or affirmation according to
the form set out for the purpose.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Terms</i></strong></div>

The Legislative Council is a permanent body,
not subject to dissolution. One-third of its members retire every two years, after completing the
term of six years.
Every Legislative Assembly has a five years
term from the date appointed for its first meeting unless dissolved earlier. The Assembly
stands automatically dissolved after five years.
The period of five years, may, while a proclamation of emergency is in operation, be extended by Parliament by law for a period not
exceeding one year at a time, and not extending
in any case beyond a period of six months after
the proclamation has ceased to operate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Qualifications</i></strong></div>

A person seeking election to the Legislative Council must have completed the age of 30
years, and possess such other qualifications as
may be prescribed by the Parliament from time
to time.
A person seeking election to the Legislative
Assembly must be twenty five years old and
posses such other qualification as may be prescribed in that behalf by or under any law made
by Parliament.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Restriction on Powers of The State
Legislatures</i></strong></div>

There are many restrictions on the powers
of the state legislature which make them subservient to the will of the Parliament, despite the
fact that the Constitution allots them a certain
residue of authority that, just for some theoretical reasons, may be identified with their area of
sovereignty. The restriction on the powers of
the state legislatures are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>State legislatures can neither legislate on
an item of the Union List nor a residuary
subject.</li>
<li>Though it can enact laws on a subject
mentioned in the Concurrent List, it is
Central law which shall prevail and to the
extent to which the state law is violative
of Central law it will be ultra vires or
constitutional.</li>
<li>Article 249 provides that the Rajya Sabha
may pass a special resolution by a two
thirds majority of members, present and
voting, to transfer any item from the State
List to the Union or Concurrent Lists for
the period of one year on the plea that it
is expedient in the national interest.</li>
<li>There are some categories that require that
a bill passed by the state legislature shall be
reserved by the Governor for the consideration of the President, even though unanimously passed by the state legislature. Bill
dealing with compulsory acquisition of private property, being derogatory to the powers of the High Court, or seeking imposition
of tax on a commodity 'essential' by an act
of Parliament, or any other bill likely to
conflict with some Union law, already in
force fall within this category.</li>
<li>The state legislatures cannot override the
veto of the President.</li>
<li>There are some kinds of bills that cannot
be introduced in the state legislatures without the prior permission of the President.
Bills seeking to impose restrictions on trade,
commerce or intercourse with other states
or within the state fall within this
category.</li>
<li>The President is empowered to declare a
states of emergency in the country without
consulting the states. But once such an
emergency has been declared, the Parliament is empowered to legislate on the
subject mentioned in the State List.
Thus, the position of the state legislatures, in
practical terms, is like that of a local and vassal
Parliament working under the over lordship of
the Parliament of India.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
