<h3>Sources of Indian Constitution</h3><br/>
The sources of Indian Constitution include the imaginative aspirations of the nationalist leaders, the 
actual working of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the experience gained from the actual working 
of some of the Constitutions of important countries of the world. Moreover, its sources include not only 
the sources upon which the founding fathers of our Constitution drew but also the developmental sources 
such as the judicial decisions, constitutional amendments, constitutional practices and so on.<br/><br/>
The sources of the Indian Constitution can thus be divided into the following two categories:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constituent Assembly Debates:</i></strong></div>

Its members included distinguished lawyers, intellectuals and patriots who took two years, eleven months 
and eighteen days to prepare the constitution. During the course of this period, debates on all the aspects 
of the Constitution were held in a free and fair manner. These debates produced an intelligent opinion in 
the light of which every word of the Constitution was screened carefully and intelligently.

 Union and States. The reports of these committees were thoroughly discussed in the Drafting Committee. It 
 was on the basis of the reports made by such committees that the draft of the Constitution was prepared.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nehru Report:</i></strong></div>

The british Government had announced the formation of the Simon Commision for making a report on the working
 of the Government of India Act, 1919 and suggest constitutional measures required for the efficient 
 administration of Indian. The Congress decided to boycott this Commision because no Indian was taken on it. 
 Instead it announced the formation of a committee under the leadership of Motilal Nehru  to make 
 recommendations about the desired constitutional set up for India. The Committee made certain recommendations

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Government of India Act 1935:</i></strong></div>

 At the time the Constitution for free India was being framed, India was governed by the Government of India 
 Act, 1935. The fathers of the Indian Constitution drew heavily on the experience and the provisions of this 
 Act. According to Jennings - "The Constitution derives directly from the Government of India Act, 1935 from 
 which, in fact, many of its provision are copied textually."

 <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of Various Constitutions:</i></strong></div>
 
 The founding fathers of the Indian Constitution were wise enough to borrow from the experience gained in 
 the working of various other Constitutions. It is on this account that the Constitution of India is 
 regarded as a bag of borrowing from the various working Constitutions

<li><b>Development Sources</b>
Indian Constitution is not a static doument. It has growmn with the changing needs. Thus amendments, judicial 
decisions, political practices, Parliamentary status, rules, regulations and ordinances are the developmental
sources of the Constitution.
<ul>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Amendments of the Constitution:</i></strong></div>
    During the
course of 60 years the Constitution has been amended about 94 times and a few other amendments are in the 
pipeline. In this way, the present shape of the Constitution is quite different from the original document. 
The 42nd Amendment made it clear that the Indian Constitution is more flexible than rigid. This Amendment is 
often termed as 'the mini Constitution of India' due to enormous changes it
effected to the Indian Constitution.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Decisions:</i></strong></div>
     The judicial decisions
given by the Supreme Court on important issues
have added new dimensions to the Constitution. It is in the light of such decisions that
further constitutional amendments are made in
the Constitution. Some of the most important
judicial decisions are:
<ul>
    <li>Gopalan vs. State of Madras;</li>
    <li>State of Madras vs. Champakam;</li>
    <li>Golak Nath vs. State of Punjab;</li>
    <li>Keshavanand Bharti vs. Kerala State</li>
</ul>

    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliamentary Statutes:</i></strong></div>
     Parliament has also
made various statues for furnishing details of the
various Articles contained in the Constitution. It
is the Constitution which itself empowers the
Parliament to enact laws on certain Articles for
details. These statues are considered as constitutional laws. Without their existence, a detailed
study of the Constitution is not possible.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commentaries of Constitutional Experts:</i></strong></div>
    While interpreting the Constitution, the views
of the distinguished constitutional experts,
whether Indian or foreign, enjoy special importance. The most notable constitutional experts
are Jennings, Gledhill, Alexandrowit, D.D. Basu,
Palkhiwala, V.N. Shukla, etc. Their views are
not given legal recognition but due regard is
paid to them by the judges. Moreover, true
significance of any provision of the Constitution
can be understood in the light of their views.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rules, Regulations, Ordinances, etc.:</i></strong></div>
     Each House of the Parliament is empowered to make
rules for its efficient working. The President has also
got the right to make rules for fixing the constitutional subjects. President of India is also empowered to 
make rules with respect to the condition of services of the members of the Union Public Service
Commission. He can also frame rules to establish peace and efficient administration of the Union Territories.
Above all, the President has also the power to issue ordinances when Parliament is not in session. All these 
rules, regulations and ordinances serve as sources of the Constitution.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Practices :</i></strong></div>
    Although the Constitution of India is the most detailed in the world, still certain practices 
    independent of the Constitution have developed in India.
    A few examples of such a practice can be enumerated as follows.
    <ul>
        <li>The Central Government takes before hand the advice of the State Government in the appointment 
            of its Governer.</li>
        <li>Governer can be recalled by the Central Government on the advice of the State Government concerned.</li>
        <li>Governer should not belong to the state to which he is appointed.</li>
        <li>One of the judges of the Supreme Court must belong to the minority community.</li>
        <li>The senior most judge of the Supreme Court should be appointed as the Chief Justice of India.</li>
        <li>The leader of the majority party in Lok sabha is appointed as the Prime Minister.</li>
    </ul> 
    </li>
</ul>
