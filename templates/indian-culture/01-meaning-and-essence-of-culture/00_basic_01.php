<h3>Meaning And Essence of Culture</h3>

Culture is collective expression of human
interaction with nature, fellow humans and
himself. It evolves human capacity to classify
and represent experiences with elaborate symbols
and customs, and to act imaginatively and
creatively. It overtime assumes idiosyncrasy
peculiar to society which results in cultural
differences world over.
<br>
<br>
Culture thus consists of the ideas, customs
and art that are produced or shared by a
particular society. A culture is a particular
society or civilization, especially one considered
in relation to its ideas, its art or its way of life.
One can also say, 'culture' is the intellectual and
artistic lifeline of a society. NCERT simplifies the
term culture 'as how man earns his living, what
kind of house he lives in, what skills he uses,
what he produces, how much knowledge he
has acquired, how he lives with his fellow men,
what he believes, how much leisure time he has
and what he does with this time.
<br>
<br>
Often 'Culture' is erroneously substituted for
'Religion' and 'Civilization'. But, they are all
defferent although technically, never opposed
to each other. 'Religion' in its wider sense
coincides with, and goes beyond, culture and in
its narrower sense, forms an important part of
it. Where religion signifies the inner experience
which reveals to the mind the real meaning and
purpose of life, it is the very soul of culture; but
where it is used for the external form in which
the inner experience has crystallized itself, it is
only a part of it. Religion as the inner realization
of the highest truth can never be opposed to
culture, but positive religion, when it has
degenerated into mere form without substance,
is often in conflict with cultural life.
Civilization is sometimes used as a substitute
for culture but generally in the sense of a higher
order of culture. Man has never been satisfied
with the way he lives. He has always struggled
to make improvements. In this struggle which
has been both long and painful, he has been
successful. He has gone ahead to find better
ways of earning his living, to set up better ways
of cooperating with his fellow men, to discover
new knowledge to express his ideas in art and
literature. To put all this in a few words, man's
culture has always been progressing. The cultures
of groups of people that have become highly
developed are often called civilizations.
Civilization is sometimes used as just another
word for culture but generally in the sense of
higher order of cultural development of people
when they begin to live in large habitations
called cities, which represent a higher level of
material life or a higher standard of living. But
a higher standard of material life has a cultural
content only when it is imbued with, or serves
as a means of attaining some ultimate moral
value. When such life is in conflict with one of
the moral values, or even when it is devoid of
any such values, it will prove to be an obstacle
to cultural progress. So civilization is not always
an ally but sometimes an enemy of culture.
All cultures differ, but their differences stem
from variations in universal theme, such as
language, religion, economy, law, technology,
etc. Since these are universal, here is much
potential for interaction between peoples.
Another language may be adopted; one religion
discarded for another; new ways of making a
living borrowed and so on. As cultures influence
each other, they are in constant change. Whether
an invention or an idea comes from within or
form without, a society must accept it before it
can become part of the culture.
<br>
<br>
When we talk of the peculiar common culture
of a country, we are concerned with these
geographical factors which find expression not
only in material forms but also create a special
mental atmosphere. It is the atmosphere which
gives to the people of country a common outlook
and temperament though they may differ in
their religions and philosophical ideas. This
common national temper and mind is the most
important source of the common national culture.
Amongst other sources are the new religious or
philosophical movements which take their birth
in the country from time to time or the culture
of peoples who have come from outside and
settled in that country or of those with whom
that country has come into contact in war or
trade and commerce.
<br>
<br>
India's national culture is an amalgam of the
common temperament and outlook which
influence the Indian mind and the intellectual
influences of various socio-religious movements
and other cultures which have sneaked in due
course and sit pretty in the national mind.
Prehistoric cultures in India, foreign cultures
with which India had a contact, cultures brought
by a stream of immigrants (now very much
citizens of India) and the socio-religious
movements sweeping India from time to time,
all have went on to construct a national culture
of India.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Physical Environment of India</i></strong></div>

India mainly consists of plains or low plateaus
watered by big rivers. The plains are well
irrigated. Sunshine is ample throughout the
year. Agriculture, therefore, is the main
occupation since the prehistoric times. Due to
difference in climate regime (mainly geared to
the amount of rainfall received) in the country,
the soils differ enormously from place to place.
Each region produces a unique product of its
own and is transported to the other regions
through waterways and roadways, thus
establishing a well-developed internal trade.
External trade was controlled mainly by
foreigners, the reason being, the sea was far
removed from the hinterland. People living in
the coastal regions did, however, undertake
some initiative in maritime trade. So, under the
influence of the physical features and forces,
India's economic life developed on an
agricultural pattern and this had a marked
influence on the shaping of her culture as a
whole. It stressed the values of peace and
constructive activity more emphatically than
those of war and destruction.
<br>
<br>
The influence of climate and economic
resources on the material life of people e.g. food,
dress, modes of living, etc., is too evident. Also,
the physical environment shapes the physique
and features of a people and, no matter how
marked may be the differences in features
amongst the people of India, there are some
common characteristics which distinguish them
from other nations. This direct effect of the
physical environment on the development of
their physique is fairly obvious. But its indirect
effect on their temperament and character, on
their mental, social and moral life is not so
apparent.
<br>
<br>
Religious philosophy has always occupied a
central place in India's cultural life. The
supremacy of thought and perception of unity
in diversity are precious traits of the Indian
mind and they are mirrored in all the cultures
which had developed in India. Its perception of
unity as the principle of life leads it to regard
harmony, rather than struggle, as the basis of
moral order. In this respect the contrast between
the Indian mind and the modern western mind
stands out clearly. The Western minds assign
great moral importance to the struggle between
man and his physical environment and regard
the conquest of nature as the key to cultural
progress. The Indian mind, on the other hand,
has developed in an environment which is
blessed by a warm climate, a rich soil, abundant
productivity and easy communication.
Other important elements are the ideas,
beliefs, principles which have their origins in the
consciousness to the higher values. Whenever
any new movement of thought originated here
or came from outside, it resulted temporarily in
accentuating the existing differences. but soon
the Indian mind set into motion its process of
seeking unity in diversity, and after some time
the conflicting elements were harmonized to lay
the foundation of a new culture. We must know
in brief the cultural history of India to understand
this phenomenon.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Role of History in the Cultural
Unification of India</i></strong></div>

A brief summary of the history of India helps
us in understanding the process of cultural
unification. Recent discoveries indicate that
around 3000 B.C. there was a developed
civilization in the north western and northern
regions of India, popularly described as the
Indus Valley Civilization. It is now known as '
Harappan Civilization'.
<br>
<br>
It now seems clear that this ancient
civilization was not confined to the valley of the
Indus but had spread east and south across half
the Indian sub-continent. Who the people of
Mohenjo-Daro and Harappa were, and where
they came from cannot be said with certainty.
The available remains indicate striking similarities
with people of Sumer, but historians offer
different explanations of the similarity. Some
are of the view that the civilization spread
westwards from the Indus basin till it reached
the banks of the Euphrates and the Tigris.
Others hold it that it came to India from Sumer.
Be that as it may, it had around 3000 B.C.
attained a high degree of maturity. One is thus
justified in holding that its beginning must go
back another 500 years.
<br>
<br>
The Indus Valley Civilization is the first
recognizable ingredient in the development of
Indian culture. Its influence has persisted to this
day and some historians declare that it is the
true progenitor of modern India. The MohenjoDaro Civilization appears to have been primarily
urban while Indian life through the centuries
has flowed mainly in rural channels. Traces of
its influence, however, persist in the way of life
of the people. Forms of dress, utensils and
pottery which are still in use go back to MohenjoDaro days. It has been suggested that some of
the religious beliefs current today- the cult of the
mother goddess, the reverence for cow, and the
worship of Shiva date back to this ancient
culture.
<br>
<br>
According to one hypothesis, the most
important influence of this civilization is to be
found in the pacifist temper of the Indian
people. Aryans in other parts of the world have
not been especially remarkable for pacifism. In
fact, they have generally been noted for their
warlike quality and temper. It may therefore be
doubted if the prevalent Indian attitude to war
and violence is derived from the Aryans. The
people of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro seem to
have developed a pacifist attitude which
according to some historians was one main
reason for their defeat at the hands of the
Aryans. In the scale of civilization, the Aryans
were perhaps inferior to the people of MohenjoDaro, but their more aggressive character and
their superiority in the art of warfare gave them
the victory.
<br>
<br>
There are no regular histories of this early
phase of Aryan settlement in India. A picture
of the life of the people, however, is obtained
from the epics and other literature. Of the epics,
the most important are the Ramayana and the
Mahabharata. Rama and Krishna dominate
these two epics. The impact of Buddha has been
one of the most significant in the history of man.
His was perhaps the first attempt to solve the
mystery of existence in rational terms and
without recourse to mysticism. He emphasized
good conduct and taught the eight-fold way by
which man can live at peace with his fellows.
He broke away from ritualism and the rigours
of caste which had become characteristic of
Indian society. His influence did not remain
confined to India but in course of time spread
throughout the world.
<br>
<br>
The first definite date which helps to fix
Indian chronology was the invasion of
Alexander in 326 B.C. Alexander did not
penetrate far into India but as a result of his
invasion, a great deal of information about
India became available to the western world. He
had brought with him a number of Greek
philosophers, scientists and historians. Aristotle,
it is said, wished to discuss with an Indian
philosopher the Indian solution to problems of
metaphysics. There is a legend that Alexander
took away with him a number of Indian scholars
to satisfy the wish of his teacher. It is certain
that the earlier contacts between western Asia
and India were further developed as a result of
Alexander's invasion.
<br>
<br>
The first empire in the history was established
almost immediately after Alexander's
withdrawal. There are earlier references to
empires which unified India but these are based
on myth and legend and we have no historical
record about them. Chandragupta Maurya was
on the other hand a historical figure and
organized a vast empire which stretched from
Afghanistan to the boundaries of Bengal.
Under Chandragupta's grandson, Ashoka,
almost the whole of India was brought under
the sway of the Mauryan Empire. Ashoka was
a great champion of the Buddhist faith. There
was however no discrimination against men
who followed other religions and in one of his
famous edicts Asoka declared that a truly
religious man had regard for all faiths. It was
due mainly to his patronage that Buddhism
spread beyond the shores of India. There are
records of missions sent by him to Ceylon,
western Asia and Egypt and it has been
suggested that his missions also visited Burma,
China and Japan.
<br>
<br>
After Asoka's death, the Mauryan Empire
gradually broke up. The reasons for the decay
of the Mauryan power are not fully known. One
explanation offered is that fresh invasions from
the north-west took place at a time when India
was militarily weak. This weakness, it is said,
was due, partly to the long period of peace
enjoyed under the Mauryans and partly to the
influence of Buddhism which discouraged
martial activities.
<br>
<br>
The interregnum between the fall of the
Mauryan empire in the second century B.C. and
the rise of the Gupta empire in the fourth
century A.D. was one of turmoil and unrest,
at least so far as north India was concerned.
With the weakening of the imperial power, new
tribes were continually pouring in.
Buddhism had suffered a setback after the
fall of the Mauryan Empire. By the time of the
Guptas, it was no longer the predominant
religion of the land. The Guptas were patrons
of Hinduism but they did not prosecute the
Buddhists. In fact, both kings and the common
people did equal honour to the Buddhist monks
and to the priests and gods of Hinduism.
The state maintained law and order but the
laws were mild and bore lightly on the people.
We have an interesting account of the life and
the times in the writings of Fahien, the first of
a famous series of Chinese pilgrims who came
to India, the homeland of Buddhism.
Like the earlier empires, the Gupta Empire
also broke down partly on account of internal
weakness and partly because of attacks by
trans-Indian tribes. These tribes were almost
invariably absorbed in the Indian social pattern.
Many of these tribes did not have a developed
culture of their own. Also the occupational
divisions of Indian society made it easy to fit
them into an appropriate place in the social
structure.
<br>
<br>
From the ninth century onward, we find
continual reference to a group of people called
the Rajputs. They gradually replaced the
kshatriyas as the ruling and fighting caste. The
term Rajputs literally means the sons of kings.
Their emphasis on royal origin and their
insistence that they were the descendants of the
epic heroes have often attracted comments.
Many historians believe that most of them were
descendants of the tribes who came after the fall
of the Gupta Empire.
Early in the seventh century, king Harsha
succeeded in establishing a unified empire in
north India. His efforts to extend his sway to the
south were however checked by Pulakeshin II.
There were thus two powerful empires in the
north and the south which offered peace and
security to the people. With the establishment of
law and order, various forms of art and culture
flourished. Agriculture and crafts trades
prospered. The restoration of peace was
accompanied by general prosperity throughout
India, Buddhism had lost its pre-eminence but
it was still widely prevalent. Harsha was a
patron of both Buddhism and Brahmanism and
welcomed to his court Hiuen Tsang, perhaps
the greatest of the Chinese pilgrims to India. He
has left an extremely interesting record of the
court of Harsha as well as of the life of the
Indian people.
<br>
<br>
As in the case of the Aryans, the incursion
of the Muslims into India was also spread over
centuries. Sind may have been the first Muslim
principality in India but the first Arab outposts
in the country had been established almost a
hundred years earlier in the far south. In fact,
it is generally accepted that the immediate
purpose of the Arab invasion of Sind was to
safeguard the trade routes with south India and
Ceylon. It has been suggested that one of the
reasons for the flourishing of religious and
philosophical activity in the southern India in
the eights and succeeding centuries was the
impact of a new and alien force on the indigenous
culture.
Except in these two centres of Arab influence,
the large majority of Muslims who came to
India in different times were Turks, Afghans
and Persians. Many of them were recent converts
to Islam and had imbibed only some of the
externals of Muslim culture. This did not prevent
them from regarding themselves as the standard
bearers of Islam. Many of the Hindu temples
were great repositories of wealth. An attack on
the temple was thus tempting to the invaders
for various reasons.
<br>
<br>
In discussing Muslim rulers of India, we
must remember that the Muslims came in
succeeding waves. They were in most cases
armies of fighting men who did not bring their
women with them and took local wives. Again,
in many cases the alternatives for Indian
prisoners of war was permanent slavery or
acceptance of Islam. These facts combined with
active proselytisation led to the growth of a
sizeable Muslim population in the course of few
centuries.
<br>
<br>
Social customs of Hindus were also
responsible for the growth in the number of
Muslims. Those who were low in the social scale
found in Islam an opportunity to assert their
dignity. The more sensitive among the socially
privileged were often attracted by its democratic
appeal. Besides, Hindu society looked askance
at released prisoners of war and they often had
no option but to join the Muslim fold. Such
large-scale absorption of Hindus slowly changed
the character of Muslim society. Even those who
had originally came from outside gradually
looked upon themselves as Indians. There were
many instances where Muslims and Hindus of
India combined to resist a Muslim invader from
outside.
Akbar was the greatest of the Mughals and
conscious integrator. His greatest contribution
was the abolition of distinctions based on religion
and the offer of equal opportunity of service and
advancement under the crown to all Indians.
Toleration had been forced on many of his
predecessors by force of circumstances. This
applied particularly to the principalities that
were established in outlying areas. Bengal and
Gujarat had kings who were remarkably tolerant
in their attitude to their non-Muslim subjects.
This was equally true to the Bahami Kingdom
and other principalities in the south. Akbar's
special distinction lies in his elevation of this
practice to a principle of sovereignty. He was,
however, essentially a ruler and his was perhaps
the conception of a Secular State.
<br>
<br>
The Mughal dynasty would have been
remarkable if it had produced only a Babar or
an Akbar. In fact, it produced five or six
generations of exceptionally able men. This
partly explains the extent and duration of the
Mughal Empire and the hold it had on the
imagination of the people. Another reason was
Akbar's reorganization of the administrative
system. Though we cannot say that he
established the rule of law, his reforms did, to
large extent, replace personal rule by governance
according to rules. His policy was followed by
his successors till the time of Aurangzeb.
Aurangzeb differed from Akbar in two
important respects. While keeping the policy in
his control, Akbar had delegated large powers
to his officers and ran his administration on the
basis of trust. Aurangzeb could not trust even
his own sons and tried to control not only policy
but even the details of administration. Aurangzeb
also differed radically from Akbar in his attitude
towards his subjects. Akbar had treated all of
them equally but Aurangzeb could not treat
even the Muslims on the basis of equality as he
kept his favours only for the Sunnis.
The first contact between India and modern
Europe took place in 1498 when Vasco de Gama
circled the African continent and landed at
Calicut. The Portuguese established a small
trading station but from the very beginning they
had imperial ambitions.
<br>
<br>
The Portuguese were followed by the Dutch,
the British and French who were all attracted
by the fabulous wealth of the East. It is difficult
to say if these later comers had any imperial
ambition initially. When they first came to
India, the Mughal power was firmly established
and they were content to get trade licenses from
the government. Though they began as traders
they were soon tempted to share in the quest for
empire. They had their trading stations on the
outskirts of the empire, and at first fortified
them for self-defence against robbers and other
raiders. It was, however, almost inevitable that
their struggles in Europe should be reflected in
their trading posts in India. In course of time,
these fortifications became centres of both
defence and offence against Indian rulers.
When the Europeans first came to India,
they were certainly inferior to the Indians in the
arts of peace. In the science of war also, they
were probably at first inferior, but nevertheless
finally won in the struggle for power. There
were many reasons for their ultimate triumph,
of which three major ones may be briefly
indicated here. The first was the break-up of the
Mughal Empire and the failure of any other
Indian empire to establish a strong central
government. After the death of Aurangzeb in
1707, there followed a period of about 150 years
when India was ridden with intrigues and
conflict. The second reason for the British
triumph was the absence of Indian naval power.
Technical progress was the third and decisive
reason why the British were able to establish
their empire in India. From the seventeenth
century onward, Europe started on a career of
triumphant scientific discoveries. In course of
time, these led to a transformation of the
technique of industrial production and the
science of war. Asia as a whole had fallen back
in the race for knowledge and power. When
therefore the clash came, Indian rulers were
unable to stand up to the British.
<br>
<br>
The introduction of the western system of
education in India was not at first encouraged
by the Government of the day but the zeal of
a handful of Christian missionaries and Indian
leader of vision and faith, overcame all
administrative inertia. The work of missionaries
like Carey and Indian leaders like Raja Ram
Mohan Ray received a great impetus as a result
of Macaulay's vehement support for Western
education. With the establishment of the three
Universities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay,
the supporters of Western education had
definitely won. Indian minds now had direct
access to the scientific temper and the liberal
political thought of the Western world. Whatever
be our criticism of the defects of the existing
system of education, there is little doubt that it
was responsible for the Indian renaissance.
