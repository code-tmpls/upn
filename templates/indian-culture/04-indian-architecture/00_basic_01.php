<h3>Indian Architecture</h3>

The earliest extant remains of recognizable
building activity on the Indian subcontinent
dates back to the third millennium, to the Indus
Valley cities of Mohenjo-Daro, Harappa, Lothal,
Kalibangan and several others. These cities are
among man's earliest attempts at organizing an
urban environment. The remarkable thing about
the arrangement of the houses in the cities was
in that they followed the grid system. Streets
were laid out in a grid pattern and there was
a defined system of land use. The buildings,
made of bricks- both burnt and unburnt, were
strictly utilitarian and built with skill and a
sound knowledge of building principles. Among
other structural techniques, the builders of these
cities used corbelled arches.
<br>
<br>
The great tank of Mohenjo-Daro, now called
the Great Bath, shows that large, ritualistic
structures were not unknown. The Great Bath
measures 11.88 x 7.01 x 2.43 metres. Flights of
steps at either end lead to the surface. There are
side rooms for changing clothes. The floor of the
Bath was made of burnt bricks. Water was
drawn from a large well in an adjacent room,
and an outlet from one corner of the Bath led
to drain. So, it is suggested that the Great Bath
served ritual bathing, which was so vital to any
religious ceremony in India.
<br>
<br>
The greatest artistic creation of the Indus
people was the seals. Numbering about 2000,
they have been found at a number of sites. They
were made from a soft stone called 'steatite'. The
technique of cutting and polishing these seals
with white luster was a unique invention of the
Harappans. The seals were of many shapessquare, rectangular, button shaped, cubical,
cylindrical and round. However, the two main
types were the square type with a carved
animal and inscription and the rectangular type
with an inscription only. Each seal had an
emblem and name or a brief inscription. The
animal most frequently depicted in the seals is
the single horned 'Unicorn'. Other animals
depicted on the seals were elephants, tigers,
bisons and Rhino. These seals probably were
used to mark the ownership of property.
Besides the seals, a large number of terracotta
figurines of men and women, birds and animals
have also been found. They were mostly used
by the commoners as toys or objects of worship.
They are considered crude artistic creations
when compared to the seals and images which
were meant for higher classes.
Some images of stone and metal have also
been discovered from the Harappan sites. The
best and the most famous is the steatite image
of a bearded man wearing an ornamental robe
found in Mohenjo-Daro. From Harappa a nude
male torso of red sandstone and a small nude
dancing figure made of grey stone have been
found. A few bronze sculptures have also been
discovered from places like Mohenjo-Daro,
Harappa, Chanhudaro and Diamabad. The
best specimen is the figure from Mohenjo-Daro
of a nude dancing girl with right hand on hips,
arms loaded with bangles, head slightly tilted
and covered with curly hair. Models of Bullock
carts and 'ikkas' have been found form Harappa
and Chahnudaro. Recently, four unique bronze
figures have been discovered at the site of
Diamabad.
<br>
<br>
After the decline of the Indus Valley cities in
the second millennium, the highly developed
and standardized brick architecture of this period
gave way, in the Vedic period that followed, to
pastoral settlements of mud, thatch, bamboo
and timber in the Valleys of the Saraswati and
Ganga rivers. Although we have no extant
examples of the perishable timber structures of
the Vedic period, our knowledge of the building
of this time is based on evidence left by
subsequent Buddhist sculptures of the third and
second centuries B.C. which often depicted
episodes from the life of the Buddha in the
architectural setting of the Vedic period. The
base reliefs at the gateways to the magnificent
stupa at Sanchi in central India, for example,
depicts clusters of circular huts with domed
thatched roofs, gables, arched timber palace
and loggias, clearly distinguishing them from
the workman-like streets of Mohenjo-Daro and
Harappa.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mauryan Art</i></strong></div>

The growth of new religions and larger
states provided the climate for the development
of arts and craft in the Mauryan period. The age
of Mauryans witnessed a distinct school of art
and architecture. Stone culture emerged as the
principal medium of Indian artists.
The Mauryan art types can be classified as
(i) state executed and (ii) Local. The former
includes palaces, columns, pillars etc. and the
latter manifests itself in the Yaksha of Parkham,
Yakshini of Besnagar etc.
<br>
<br>
The royal place at Kumarhar near Patilputra
has been lavishly praised by Arrian, who says
that in grandeur it outscores even the palaces
at Susa and Ecatabana.
The best specimens of Mauryan art are the
highly polished, tall and well proportioned
columns with slightly tapering monoliths
standing free in space. The columns that bear
the edicts of Ashoka include those of Delhi
(Meerut), Allahabad, Lauriya Araraj, Lauriya
Nandangarh, Rampurva (with lion capital),
Delhi Topra, Sankissa (elephant), Sanchi and
Sarnath. The non-edict bearing columns are
those of Rampurva (with bull capital), Besarch
Bakhira (Single lion capital), Kosam etc. Columns
containing dedicatory inscriptions are those of
Rummindei (horse) and Nigali Sagar.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Comparison of Archaemenid and
Mauryan Columns</i></strong></div>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Archaemenid Column</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Columns of the hall of Persepolis are
provided with intricately carved capitals.</li>
        <li>Archaemenid columns had their base.</li>
        <li>The bell form is used as supporting base.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mauryan Column</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Stone columns of the Mauryan palace
are without capitals.</li>
        <li>Mauryan columns had no base at all.</li>
        <li>The bell form serves as capitals. The
Mauryan bell seems to have been derived
from the stylized lotus motif. They used the
tapering shaft and inverted lotus.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The Mauryans excelled in cave architecture.
In fact they were the pioneers of rock-hewn
caves. The Barabar caves, of which the Sudama
cave is the earliest, are the earliest examples of
such caves. The Sudama and Lomas Rishi caves
have wood imitating chambers and their walls
are polished like glass mirror. Another cave
called the karma chupar contains an in scription
of Asoka. The granite Nagarjuni hills possess
three major caves. Dasarath dedicated them to
the Ajivika sect. The largest of these is known
as 'Gopi'.
<br>
<br>
The Mauryan period also saw the
development of sculpture. These sculptures were
found atop pillars. The elephant sculpture of
Dhauli in Orissa and other animal figurines of
bull, elephant, lion, garuda etc. are found on the
abacus of the pillars. One of the best specimens
is a row of pecking geese that decorate the
Rampurva lion abacus.
The Mauryan period, formed a distinct epoch
in the history of Indian art as an attempt was
made to change from wood oriented art to that
of the stone.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Buddhist Influence</i></strong></div>

It was around the 3rd to 2nd century B.C.
that Buddhism became the dominant religion
and as we have seen stone was introduced for
the first time in Indian art and architecture.
Many of these stone structures have survived
the ravages of time and we have, therefore, a
reasonable amount of information about them.
The three characteristic forms of Buddhist
architecture which were developed around this
period were the stupa or monumental funerary
mound, the chaitya or hall of worship and the
Vihara or monastery. At Buddhist centres in
Sanchi and Bharhut in central India the stone
railings and gateways clearly reflect their
wooden origins in their architectural forms and
in the way they have been carved.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Chaitya</b>- This fell into two phases Hinayana
and Mahayana. Earlier monuments have
been found at Bhaja, Kanheri and Karle etc.
Karle has architectural grandeur and a
disturbing beauty in its sculptures,
especially the male and female figures on
the capitals.
<br>
<br>
A Chaitya consists of portico in front of a
large window on top. Inside, under a high
vaulted roof are three constituent parts: a
mandapa in the centre with a double column on
the two sides, behind there is a
pradakshinapatha and a garbhagriha at the
further end which contains a stone stupa called
the Chaitya. Its highest development has been
found in cave no. 19 at Ajanta.</li>
        <li><b>Vihara</b>- It consists of a central hall entered
by a doorway from the verandah in front.
The viharas or monasteries were excavated
near Chaityas for the residence of monks
in rainy seasons. It is full of sculptors which
depict various scenes from the life of the
Buddha. Nagarjunkonda prospered most
under Ikshvakus, the successor of the
Satavahanas. It contains not only Buddhist
Monuments but also the earliest brahminical
brick temples.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Stupas</i></strong></div>

The stupa began as an earthen burial mound,
which was revered by the local population. The
cult of the stupa was taken up by Buddhism.
Asoka is said to have built 84,000 stupas all over
India. The stupas were large hemispherical
domes, containing a small central chamber, in
which the relics of Buddha were placed in a
casket, often beautifully carved in crystal. The
core of the stupa was of unburnt brick and the
outer face of burnt brick, covered with a thick
layer of plaster. The stupa was crowned by an
umbrella of wood or stone, and was surrounded
by a wooden fence enclosing a path for the
ceremonial clock wise circumambulation (Pradakshina). The main stupas according to
chronology are Bharhut, Gaya, Sanchi,
Amravati, Sarnath and Nalanda.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Bharhut Stupa</i></strong></div>    
        
The Bharhut Stupa, perhaps in its present
form dating from the middle of the 2nd century
B.C. (Sunga period) is important chiefly for its
sculpture, and the stupa itself has now vanished.
The sculptures show very realistic relief of
Indian city life. They also show crowds of
worshippers reverencing the symbols of Buddha,
not his image. The upright posts of the stupa
railings are carved with Yakshas and Yakshis,
beautifully finished and very decorative. The
medallions of the crosspieces mostly depict scenes
from the jataka stories. The railings of the stupa
are built of red sandstone. They give us valuable
insight into the religious faith and city life
during that period. However, the art of sculpture
was still developing and lacks finishing and is
archaic.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Gaya Stupa</i></strong></div>
            
At Bodh Gaya, there is a railing around the
great stupa. The railing probably belongs to the
1st century B.C. but the Stupa is of a later date.
The sculptures are similar to those found in
Bharhut. The Gaya railing encloses the sacred
path where Buddha is believed to have walked
in meditation. The figures in the railings are
deeper, more vital and rounded and show an
advance over the medallions containing human
head.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sanchi Stupa</i></strong></div>    
        
This is one of the most striking architectural
remains of ancient India. It contains three big
stupas. The big stupa originally built by Asoka,
was enlarged to twice its original size in the 2nd
century B.C. It thus becomes a hemisphere of
about 120 feet in diameter. The old wooden
railings were replaced by stone ones and towards
the end of the 1st century, four glorious gateways
(Toranas) were added at the four cardinal
points. Although the railings are quite plain, the
gateways are full of sculpture illustrating the
jataka stories and various episodes in the life of
Gautama Buddha. Though the scenes resemble
those at Bharhut, they show a far higher
standard of technical skill and artistic conception,
inspired by a sense of beauty, rhythm and
symmetry.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Amravati Stupa</i></strong></div>    
        
In the lower valley of the Krishna River, the
beautiful stupa of Amravati was erected. In the
late satavahana period, the railings of Amravati
Stupa were made of marble. The dome was also
covered with slabs of marble. The stupa
contained reliefs depicting scenes of Buddha's
life and were surrounded with free standing
Buddha figures. They mark a difference from
the northern style and hence said to belong to
a new school viz. that of Amravati. The image
of Buddha occurs here and there but mostly he
is represented by a symbol. The influence of
Amravati school was felt in Southeast Asia and
Ceylon. Besides, it influenced the south Indian
sculpture.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nagarjunakonda Stupa</i></strong></div>    
        
Besides the stupa, two chaitya and a vihara
have been excavated by the Archaeological
Survey of India. Near the stupa, slabs of limestone
illustrating scenes from Buddha's life were found.
A panel shows seven foot prints of the Buddha
on a piece of cloth held by the deities, who were
present to welcome the blessed one. The stupa
belongs to the Saka Satavahana phase.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sarnath Stupa</i></strong></div>    
        
Sarnath near Varanasi was the place of
Buddha's first sermon. It has beautifully
patterned brickwork with a highly cylindrical
upper dome rising from a lower hemispherical
one, with large images of Buddha set in gable
ends at the cardinal points. In its final form it
dates from the Gupta period.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nalanda Stupa</i></strong></div>  
        
The Stupa at Nalanda was successively
enlarged seven times. In its present ruined
condition it gives the impression of brick pyramid
with steps leading up to its terraces. It was
originally a tall stupa raised on a high base, with
a smaller stupa at each corner. It was successively
altered during Gupta and Pala times. It was
destroyed by Bakhatiyar Khalji.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Caves</i></strong></div>

The art of building artificial caves for religious
purpose began during the period of the
Mauryans. The Barabar and Nagarjuni caves
have been dealt with earlier. Some other
important caves are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Udaigiri Caves: There are two places
named Udaigiri and both have cave temples.
One is in the Udaigiri hills in Orissa and
the other is near Bhilsa in M.P. In Orissa,
the caves are found near the Udaigiri and
Khandgiri hills. Khandgiri hills have 16
caves, which include Navagiri, Devsabha
and Anant Gumph etc. The Udaigiri hills
have 19 caves including Rani Gumpha,
Ganesh Gumpha, Hathigumpha, Vyaghra
Gumpha, etc. The Rani Gumpha is the
largest cave. Near Bhilsa (M.P.), Udaigiri
caves boast of sculpture of the highest
quality. During the Gupta period, a great
Boar was carved in relief near the entrance
of the cave. The Boar symbolizes God
Vishnu's Varaha Avtar.</li>
        <li>Bhaja Caves: The oldest Deccan cave at
Bhaja near Poona consists of a deep apsidal
hall cut in solid rock, with a row of plain
octagonal pillars near the walls. At the
further end of the hall is a small stupa, also
cut from solid rock, and the outside of the
cave has a carved façade. Besides this cave,
there is a second cave where monks used
to dwell.</li>
        <li>Karle Caves: The Karle caves were made
around the beginning of the Christian era.
The great Chaitya at Karle is situated at a
distance of two miles north of the BombayPoona Highway. The Chaitya is cut 124 feet
deep into the rock. Its pattern is similar to
the Bhaja caves but is much more
developed in size and splendor.</li>
        <li>Kondan Caves: It is situated 10 miles north
of the Karle Chaitya. It consists of both
Chaityas and Vihars.</li>
        <li>Bedsa Caves: The Bedsa caves are located
in the erstwhile Bombay Presidency. The
Chaityas of Bedsa are smaller in size than
those of Karle. The preponderance of stone
in compression to wood is its distinctive
feature.</li>
        <li>Peetalkhor Caves: These caves are located
in the satamala hills, 50 miles south-west
of the Ajanta caves.</li>
        <li>Ajanta Caves: Ajanta in Maharashtra has
no less than 29 caves some going 100 feet
deep into the rock. They were excavated in
the horse shoe curve of a hill side. The
earliest caves date from 2nd century B.C.
while others are of as late as 7th century
A.D. The Ajanta mural paintings are world
famous. The walls were first covered with
a coating of clay or cow dung and bound
together with straw or hair and then
finished with white gypsum. It is remarkable
that they have withstood the ravages of
nature. The paintings of cave No. 10 date
from the beginning of the Christian era
while those of cave No. 1 and cave No. 16
are from perhaps six centuries later. The
murals chiefly depict scenes from the life of
Buddha and the Jatakas. Though painted
for religious purpose, the murals bear a
secular rather than a religious message. We
see a whole life of ancient India in a
panorama. It includes princes, beggars,
peasants, ascetics, beasts, birds, flowers etc.
The famous paintings are of "the dying
princess" and "the mother and child". Most
of the caves belong to the Gupta period.</li>
        <li>Ellora Caves: Ellora caves are situated near
Aurangabad, some 30 miles from Ajanta.
There are no less than 34 caves constructed
from the 5th to the 8th centuries A.D., most
of them Hindu but some Buddhist and
Jaina. The caves generally resemble those
of Nasik and Karle but the façade of the
Buddhist Visvakarma cave shows a
pleasing modification. Caves No. 14 and 15
are famous and are known as 'Ravan Ki
Khai' and 'Dasavatar caves' respectively.
The Jaina caves include 'Indra Sabha' and
'Jagannath Sabha'. These caves are at a
short distance from the Kailashnath temple
built by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna I.</li>
        <li>Elephanta Caves: The cave temples of
Elephanta, a beautiful little island off the
coast of Bombay belong to the 8th century
A.D. They are in the same style as those of
Ellora. They are famous for their sculpture
especially for the great Trimurti figure of
Shiva. Besides, some other notable
sculptures include Ravana shaking the
Kailash, Ardh-narishwara, Tandav dance
of Shiva etc.</li>
        <li>Kanheri Caves: The Kanheri caves are
situated near Bombay. The Chaityas of
Kanheri follow the pattern of the Karle
Chaitya. The influence of Mahayana is
evident. The outer walls of the caves bear
images of Buddha. There are more than 100
caves here.</li>
        <li>Junnar Caves: These caves are located 40
miles north of Pune in Maharashtra. It has
150 caves, of which 10 are Chaityas and
the rest are Vihars.</li>
        <li>Mandapeshwar Caves: It has 3 caves
dating from the 8th century. The caves have
now been converted into a Christian shrine.</li>
        <li>Nasik Caves: These caves date from the 1st
century A.D. An inscription from the cave
reveals that it was built during the reign of
the Satavahana ruler Krishna. The doorway
of the chaitya has ornate emblems denoting
crescent. The Pandu Lena cave is symbolic
of Hinayana influence as Buddha is
represented only through symbols.</li>
        <li>Bagh Caves: These caves are situated in
Madhya Pradesh, some hundred miles
north of Ajanta. On the walls of the veranda
of a cave at Bagh, a procession of elephants
and a scene of a dancer and women
musicians are depicted. They are more
impressive than even those of Ajanta.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Caves</i></strong></div>

In the centuries that followed, Buddhism
lost its hold over the Indian people and the
material prosperity of the 5th century paved the
path for a resurgence of Brahminical or Hindu
thought. Once re-established, Hindu hegemony
maintained its ascendency over the majority of
the Indian people for the next millennium and
this was reflected in the way religious
architecture developed in India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Schools of Architecture</i></strong></div>

The Gandhara School: The Gandhara School
flourished from about the middle of the 1st
century B.C. to about the end of the 5th century
A.D., in the lower Kabul valley and upper Indus
near Peshawar. It owes its origin to the Greek
rulers of Bactria and north-west India and has
hence been called ' Indo-Greek'. However its
chief patrons were the Sakas and the Kushanas.
Mahayanism led to the deification of Buddha.
Hence his images were carved. Gandhara
sculptures, mostly pertaining to Buddha or
Buddhist scenes, have been found in Taxila,
Afghanistan and the North West frontier
province of Pakistan. They used stone, stucco,
terracotta and clay and appear to have been
embellished with Gold leaf or paint. The earliest
specimens include two headless statues of
Buddha form Loriyan Tongai and Hastanagar
and a standing Hariti figure from sakrah Dheri.
However, the best specimens are found in the
Dharamaraja Stupa at Taxila and at Jauliana
and Hadda near Jalalabad.
<br>
<br>
The Gandhara School was influenced by
Greco- Roman art traditions. It has the tendency
to mould the human body in a realistic manner
with great attention paid to accuracy of physical
details like delineation of muscles, moustaches,
curly hair etc. It is marked by the representation
of thick drapery with large and bold fold lines.
It is also known for rich carving, elaborate
ornamentation and complex symbolism.
The Gandhara architecture includes large
and small monasteries like those at Taxila
(Dharamraya), Mamakhja (Rawalpindi), Mohra,
Marada and Jaulian. Though essentially Indian,
they used Hellenistic motifs like the Corinthian
capital, triangular pediments, medallions etc.
and Iranian features like fire altars and animal
capitals. Even the stupas built in this style have
such ornamentation. Besides, the height was
increased by elevating it on a high platform.
Mathura School: The Mathura School
originated in the middle of the 2nd century B.C.,
though its real progress began form the 1st
century A.D. The Mathura sculptures are easily
distinguished by the material used -a kind of
spotted red sandstone. It was partly influenced
by the Gandhara School and greatly influenced
the Gupta School of art. Some of the early
craftsmen made votive plaques depicting the
cross legged naked figure of a Trithankara,
which may have inspired the Buddhists to
depict their own teacher. The Yakshi with a bird
and cage found from the railings of a stupa is
probably a Jaina sculpture.
<br>
<br>
The Buddhists of Mathura impart a sublime
and spiritual expression to the figure as against
laying stress on anatomical details as in the
Gandhara School. This is the difference between
Indian and the Western art. The spiritual
strength of the images in Mathura was displayed
by a halo (illuminating circle) behind the faces
of the images.
Artists of Mathura also carved out image of
Brahminical Gods like Shiva, Vishnu, Parvati,
Laxmi, Brahma, Surya, Kubera and Mahishasura
Mardini etc.
<br>
<br>
The most striking remains of Mathura school
are the female figures of yakshini, Nagins and
Apsaras. Their broad hip, slender waist and
pert attitude give an impression of a dancing
girl. It reflects the Indian outlook which did not
abhor sensuality in the context of piety and
renunciation.
The Royal statues of Mathura school have
been found in Mat, near Mathura and at Surkh
Kota in Afghanistan. Besides, the headless statue
of Kanishka is widely renowned.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gupta Art</i></strong></div>

The architectural output of the great
resurgence under the Guptas was phenomenal.
The artistic creativity became a mighty upsurge
of the national art during the golden age of this
empire. It created a whole new stream of
architectural tradition, one which came to be
closely woven around the forms of the Hindu
temples that became powerful centres of worship
and learning in the centuries that followed.
Until this period, the general plan of all religious
shrines was, by and large apsidal. During this
period, the temple evolved from the simple
square chamber that existed in the early Gupta
shrines at Sanchi to a more elaborate structure.
The Gupta temples were independent structures
built of dressed stone blocks placed together.
The shrine was a simple structure to begin with.
The doorway was elaborately carved.
<br>
<br>
The following types of structural temples
belong to this period (i) Flat roofed square
temple e.g. Temple No. 17 at Sanchi (ii) Flat
roofed temple with a vimana above e.g. Parvati
temple at Nachna Kuthara in Panna (M.P.) and
Shiva temple at Bhumara in Satna (M.P.). They
show Dravidian features. (iii) Square temple
with a shikhara above e.g. Dasavatar temple at
Deogarh in Jhansi (U.P.). (iv) Rectangular temple
e.g. Kopoleshwara and Durga temple at Aihole
(v) Circular temple e.g. Maniyar Math.
During the Gupta period many stupas were
constructed e.g. the Dhamekh stupa at Sarnath,
Jararangh's Assembly at Rajgrih, Stupa at Mirpur
Khaas in Sindh and Stupa at Ratnagiri in
Orissa. As regards sculpture, two stand out.
One is the carved Boar in the Udaigiri Caves in
Bhilsa (M.P.) and a dancer found at Pawaye,
near Gwalior. Excellence in copper casting is
reflected in the image of Buddha found at
Nalanda and the Sultangunj Buddha. In the
field of Painting, those at Ajanta, Bagh and
Badami stand out.
<br>
<br>
After an early period of experimentation,
two distinct styles of temple architecture
emerged, and the major difference between
them was the shape of the temple spire, that
became the characteristic feature of the Hindu
temple. In the north the spire, called the shikhara,
was more or less smoothly pyramidal in outline,
rising in an uninterrupted slope to a rounded
top and pointed tip. In the south, the spire was
called the vimana and it rose in a series of
diminishing steps, like a stepped pyramid,
creating a singular and distinctive shape. The
earliest examples of the shikhara and the vimana
were evident in the masonry forms of the
Chalukyan temples at Aihole, Pattadakal and
Badami, and were later refined by the skill of
sculptors at Mahabalipuram in the 7th-8th
century who fashioned a series of experimental
temples out of outcrops of rock, adding yet
another dimension to the traditions of rock cut
architecture in India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Styles of Temple Architecture</i></strong></div>

Indian temple architecture had three distinct
styles i.e. the Nagara, Dravida and the Vesara.
In general terms they represented the North,
South and the land between the Vindhyas and
the Krishna respectively. However, they did not
always conform to geographical limits and this
is evident in the development of the Vesara style
which was a fusion of Nagara and Dravida
styles.
In terms of planning, the Nagara style temple
is a square with a number of graduated
projections (Rathakas) in the middle of each
face which gives it a cruciform shape in the
exterior. In elevation, it exhibits a shikhara
capped by a spheroid slab with ribs around the
edge (Rathaka). Thus the cruciform ground
plant and curvilinear tower may, hence, be
regarded as the fundamental characteristics of
the Nagara temples. The Orissa temples are
regarded as the nearest to the Nagara archetype.
<br>
<br>
In terms of planning and elevation, a Dravida
style temple had the sanctum cella situated
invariably with an ambulatory hall and a
pyramidal tower formed by an accumulation of
storey after storey, in receding dimensions. These
are regarded as the distinctive characteristics of
the Dravida temple. As later innovations, pillared
mandaps and gateways (Gopuram) were added.
The vesara style is also called the Chalukyan
style. This style is a fusion of Dravida and
Nagara styles. Aihole and Pattadakal have many
temples of these styles.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chalukyan Art</i></strong></div>

Groups of temples at Badami and Aihole
(ancient Aryapura) show a juxtaposition of the
Nagara and Dravida Shikara style. Virupaksha
temple at Pattadakal, near Badami, clearly
betrays the influence of Kailashnath temple of
Kanchi. It shows the influence of the Pallavas
on the Chalukyan art. There are ten temples at
Pattadakal. The most celebrated of these are
papanatha temple and Virupaksha temple. The
temple walls are adorned with beautiful
sculptures representing scenes from the
Ramayana.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rashtrakuta Art</i></strong></div>

The Kailash temple at Ellora, built in the
time of Krishan I and representing the boldest
attempt in the field of rock-cut architecture,
reproduced all the details of a structural temple
in the intricacies of rock excavation. Cave shrine
of Elephanta is dedicated to Shiva, whose image
as Mahesha (Popularly known as Trimurti)
counts amongst the most magnificent creation
of India. The three faces represent Shiva as
Creator, Preserver and Destroyer.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pallava Art</i></strong></div>

Pallavas, in far south, were great patrons of
art, especially cave and temple architecture.
Mahendravarman and Narasimhavarman were
the most important among the patrons who
contributed to the growth of architecture. At
Mahabalipuram, we have several rock-cut caves.
In the Adivaraha cave, we have effigies of
Mahendravarman and his two queens.
<br>
<br>
Monolithic temples, known as rathams, belong
to the reign of Mahamalla. The Dharmaraja
Ratham had portrait of Mahamalla himself. A
third type of Pallava monument is the tirtham
or magnificent open- air carving in relief on a
rock surface. The differences between the
monuments of this period and those of Gupta
period are quite obvious. The Pallava monuments
have greater slenderness and freer movement of
forms, a more oval face and higher cheek bones.
In the reign of Rajasimha, the rock-cut
technique was abandoned and replaced by
structural temple of masonry and stone. The
shore temple of Jalashayama Swami is built of
dressed stone with excellent workmanship.
Kailashnath temple is a kind of structural temple.
There are three separate parts of it: a sanctum
with a pyramidal tower, a mandapa and a
rectangular courtyard showing a series of
subsidiary shrines or cells.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chola Art</i></strong></div>

Temple architecture in South India attained
its climax under the Cholas. Under the Pallavas,
the rock-cut technique was abandoned. The
new style of architecture which came into
vogue during this period attained its most
magnificent form under the Cholas. This style
is called Dravida. The main feature of this style
was the building of a storey upon a storey above
the chide deity room (garbhagriha). The number
of storey varied from five to seven and they had
a typical style which came to be called the
vimana. A pillared hall called mandap, with
elaborately carved pillars and a flat roof, was
generally placed in front of the sanctum. It
acted as an audience hall and was a place for
various other activities such as ceremonial dances
which were performed by devadasis. The entire
structure was enclosed in a courtyard
surrounded by high walls which were pictured
by lofty gates called gopurams. In course of time
the vimanas rose higher and higher and the
Gopurams also became more and more elaborate.
<br>
<br>
Thus, the temples became a miniature city.
Kalashnath temple (8th century) is an early
example of Dravida style. One of the finest and
the most elaborate examples of this style is
Brihadeswara Temple of Tanjore which was
built by Rajaraja I. This is also called Rajaraja
temple because the cholas were in the habit of
installing image of kings and queens in the
temples, in addition to the deity. The temple at
Gangaikonda-cholapuram is another example
of this style.
<br>
<br>
Temple architecture was refined and given
clarity between the 10th and 13th centuries in
the soaring temple of Khajuraho in central
India, Konark in eastern India, and Thanjavur
in the south where the form of the temple came
to fruition in triumphantly confident structures
that are rich and satisfying. Intricate carvings
on the surfaces of these temples provided a rich
texture to the forms and united them stylistically,
by establishing a uniformity of treatment in
diverse regional variations. Thus, developments
in the western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat
culminated in the huge Jain temple of Mount
Abu and Palitana, which are decorated with
amazingly intricate carving both inside and
outside the shrines. In Tamil Nadu, vestibules
called Gudha mandaps and towering gateways
or Gopurams became an intrinsic part of temple
design just as dancing halls and ambulatory
paths were incorporated into the temples of
Modhera in Gujarat, Konark and Puri in Orissa
and Khajuraho in Central India. In
Rameshwaram in the south, Kashmir in the
north and Konark in the east, open courtyards
called parikramas and chariot shaped structures
became the distinguishing features of the temple
of these regions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hoysala Art</i></strong></div>

The wheel came full circle once again in the
region of modern Karnataka. Here, in the twin
cities of Halebid and Belur, the so-called northern
and southern styles were submerged once again
into a single entity in the greater creation of the
Hoysala dynasty. The rectangular off sets of the
pyramidal form of the vimana and the
curvilinear profile of the shikhara were
transmuted into a bell shaped tower planted
over a star-shaped tower garbhagriha or shrine.
The stones that were used in the temples are of
much finer grain, kind of greenish or bluish
black coloristic schist, which being close textured,
can take delicate and minute carving. Keshava
Temple at Somnathpur and a group of temple
at Belur in Hassan district are fine examples of
Hoysala art. The greatest achievement of this art
is Hoysaleshvara Temple at Halebid.
<br>
<br>
The last monumental, if not innovative
outcome of Hindu building talents was the
legendary city of Vijayanagar, in a place called
Hampi in modern Karnataka. We have evidence
of architecture which sought to preserve the
existing landscape, using it as a means of
enhancing the buildings designed at Vijayanagar.
The architecture seems to virtually have been
built in the landscape. At places, one is unable
to discern where landscape ends and
architecture begins. A profusion of heavily
carved columns in flat roofed pavilions
characterize the buildings of Vijayanagar.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pala School</i></strong></div>

Pala School is referred to as the "Eastern
School". It flourished in Bihar and Bengal from
8th to the 13th century. Nalanda was its greatest
centre. Ichnographically, there are three stages
of Nalanda Art:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Early Mahayana phase with Buddha and
Bodhisattva images-both in stone and
bronze.</li>
        <li>Safhjayana images.</li>
        <li>Kalchakra of the Kapalika system
Stone sculptures of the Pala School were
found at Nalanda, Rajagriha, Bodhgaya,
Rajashahi and Kching in Mayurbhanj.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Orissa School</i></strong></div>

The temples of Orissa form one of the most
compact and homogeneous architectural groups
within the Nagara style. In fact the Orissa
temples are regarded as the nearest to the
original Nagara archetype. In Orissan temple
the plan of the sanctum and the hall in front of
it (called Jagmohan) is plainly square in the
interior but externally the walls exhibit series of
buttress like projections in the middle of each
side because of which the ground plan tends to
assume a cruciform shape.
<br>
<br>
The early temples of Orissa resemble the
Gupta temples and include the
Shatrughaneshwara group, Parsuramesvara
temple, Markandeshwara temple and
Bhuvaneshwara temple. The Mukteshwara
temple, belonging to 9th century A.D. represents
a mature expression of the Nagara temples in
Orissa. On the other hand, the Siddheshwara
temple represents the transition from the Nagara
form to the typical Orissan form. The lingaraja
temple represents the Orissan type in its
maturity. The sun temple, Konark built by
Narsimha I excels the Lingaraja temple in nobility
of its conception and the perfection of its finish.
The court of the temple had erotic sculpture.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bundelkhand School</i></strong></div>

In central India the Nagara Temple reached
one of its most exuberant expressions. It followed
the Orissan style and as in Orissa, developed its
own regional features. Its crowning glory is the
Khajuraho group of temple. While in Orissan
temples the sanctuary, assembly hall and
entrance portico were considered as separate
entities joined by a vestibule, Khajuraho temples
treat them as a whole. In central India pillars
have been introduced in the interior as well as
the lateral ends to support the roof. Khajuraho
shikharas also have miniature shikharas. The
main temples of this school are Kendriya
Mahadev temple at Khajuraho, Panchratha
temple at Baroli, Keshvanarayana temple,
Amarkantaka, Karna temple, Virateshwara
temple, and Vishwanath temple at Khajuraho.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Southern School</i></strong></div>

It began during the reign of Pallavas. It
reached its climax during the Cholas. One of the
great contributions of the south Indian Art is
Shiva Nataraja, symbolizing the processes of
creation and dissolution in terms of the dynamic
dance of divinity. The great metaphysical
problem of motion and rest as expressed in the
cosmos and its source have been best expressed 
in the dancing figure of Shiva Nataraja.
