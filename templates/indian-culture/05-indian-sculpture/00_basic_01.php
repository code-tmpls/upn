<h3>Indian Sculpture</h3>

Indian sculptors had mastered the bronze
medium and the casting process as much as
they had mastered terracotta sculpture and
carving in stone. The cire-perdu or lost-wax
process for casting was learnt as long ago as the
Indus Valley Culture. Along with it was
discovered the process of making alloy of metals
by mixing copper, zinc and tin which is called
bronze.
<br>
<br>
Bronze sculptures and statuettes of Buddhist,
Hindu and Jain icons have been discovered
from many regions of India dating from the
second century until the sixteenth century. Most
of these were required for ritual worship and
are characterized by exquisite beauty and
aesthetic appeal. At the same time the metalcasting process continued to be utilized for
making articles for various purposes of daily
use, such as utensils for cooking, eating, drinking,
etc. Present day tribal communities also utilize
the 'lost-wax' process for their art expressions.
Perhaps the 'Dancing Girl' in tribhanga
posture from Mohenjodaro is the earliest bronze
sculpture datable to 2500 BCE. The limbs and
torso of this female figurine are simplified in
tubular form. A similar group of bronze statuettes
have been discovered on archaeological
excavation at Daimabad (Maharashtra) datable
to 1500 BCE. Significant is the 'Chariot', the
wheels of which are represented in simple
circular shapes while the driver or human rider
has been elongated, and the bulls in the forefront
are modelled in sturdy forms.
Interesting images of Jain Tirthankaras have
been discovered from Chausa, Bihar, belonging
to the Kushana period during second century
CE. These bronzes show how the Indian
sculptors had mastered the modelling of
masculine human physique and simplified
muscles. Remarkable is the depiction of Adinath
or Vrishabhnath, who is identified with long
hairlocks dropping to his shoulders. Otherwise
the tirthankaras are noted by their short curly
hair.
<br>
<br>
Many standing Buddha images with right
hand in abhaya mudra were cast in North
India, particularly Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.
The sanghati or the monk's robe is wrapped to
cover the shoulders which turns over the right
arm, while the other end of the drapery is
wrapped over the left arm. Eventually the pleats
are held by the extended hand of the same arm.
The drapery falls and spreads into a wide curve
at the level of the ankles. The Buddha's figure
is modelled in a subtle manner suggesting, at the
same times, the thin quality of the cloth. The
whole figure is treated with refinement; there is
a certain delicacy in the treatment of the torso.
The figure appears youthful and proportionate
in comparison with the Kushana style. In the
typical bronze from Dhanesar Khera, Uttar
Pradesh, the folds of the drapery are treated as
in the Mathura style, i.e., in a series of drooping
down curves. Sarnath-style bronzes have foldless
drapery. The outstanding example is that of the
Buddha image at Sultanganj, Bihar, which is
quite a monumental bronze figure. The typical
refined style of these bronzes is the hallmark of
the classical quality.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Classical Sculpture</i></strong></div>

The highest expression of form in art is
through sculpture according to Indian canons.
Chitra is the term for sculpture in the round,
while carving in relief, high or low, is styled
Ardhachitra. The earliest examples of sculpture
in India go back to the Harappan period in the
third millennium B.C. The renowned dancing
girl form Mohenjo-Daro is an image in metal
which is world famous.
<br>
<br>
For quite a long time there was a gap of
period unrepresented by sculptural examples,
creating a dark age, which came to an end by
the fourth century B.C., when there appeared
again sculptures of exquisite charm. The
Mauryan period, with Asoka's craftsmen at
work, has examples of such highly sophisticated
technique, realistic charm and perfection of
study of the anatomy of human, animal and
bird that there should have been a long tradition
behind it, running into centuries. The anatomy
and form of the animal had been so well studied
in the magnificent row of elephant on the
fa√ßade of the Lomas Rishi cave in the Barabar
hills and the sturdy bull and the stately lion
composition from Sarnath pillars. The Chauri -
Bearer from Didarganj is a monolith with mirrorlike polish.
Sunga sculpture of the second century B.C.
is represented adequately by the remains of the
carved rail and Torana gateway that once
adorned the Stupa at Bharhut in central India.
The visit of king Ajatasatru of Magadha and
Prasenajit of Kosala are two famous episodes
represented at Bharhut.
<br>
<br>
Contemporary rulers of the Sungas in the
Deccan were the Satavahanas whose earliest
phase of art has given us the famous panels of
Surya and Indra in the Bhaja cave of the second
century B.C. in western India. The magnificent
eastern torana gateway of the Sanchi Stupa was
delicately carved by the ivory carvers of Vidisha
who were equally at home in carving in stone,
as recording an inscription on it. An inscription
equally informs us of an early Satakarni who
has created this. The beautiful carvings in the
Karle and Konadana caves are also the result of
Satavahana patronage.
The most magnificent phase of Satavahana
art is seen in the exquisitely rendered carving on
the rail from Amravati of 150 A.D.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kushana Art</i></strong></div>

The Kushanas had a large empire that
extended from the north western area of
Gandhara to nearly the borders of Bihar with
one mode of sculpture (Gandhara) in their
western and another the indigenous Mathura
school in their eastern part. The Gandhara
School is mainly determined by Greco- Roman
norms and is an Indian theme expressed in
foreign technique and spirit. The Mathura school
of Kushana art is more pleasing as a worthy
companion of Satavahana art in the south.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Solar Deity</i></strong></div>

The most astounding temple monument of
the Ganga is the one for the solar deity at
Konark which is literally a monumental chariot
on several wheels drawn by seven horses. The
monumental sculptures of the running elephant
and horse here, once seen, are never forgotten.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chandella Architecture</i></strong></div>

Chandella sculpture itself is most
concentrated in Khajuraho, where the temples
dating from the 10th to the 12th century have
a wealth of sculpture representing gorgeous
royal processing, rare iconographic forms and
erotic scenes illustrating many of the Ratibandhas
of the Kama sutra.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pallava Architecture</i></strong></div>

In the south the great Pallava king
Mahendravarman, who was at once a sculptor,
painter, poet, musician, engineer all in one,
created rock-cut temple for the first time. Among
his several simple massive cave temples the most
famous is the one at Triuchirapalli. His son
Narasimhavarman became immortal through
his famous monuments. They include the five
rathas with their beautiful sculptures. The
Kailash temple at Kanchipuram with its precious
sculptured decoration is a gem of Pallava art.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chola Architecture</i></strong></div>

The Cholas, who continued the tradition,
have magnificent early temples at Kodumbalur,
Srinivasanallur and other important places in
their realm, but the most striking examples of
Chola architecture and sculpture are from the
huge temples built by the father and son,
emperors Rajaraja and Rajendra, at Thanjavur
and Gangaiknodacholapuram. The Bhikshatana
image at Thanjavur completes the picture along
with the Nataraja at Gangaikondacholapuram.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chalukya Architecture</i></strong></div>

From the Western Chalukyas, Mangalesa must be remembered for
his magnificent cave temple at Badami and
Vikramaditya for his masterly Virupaksha temple at pattadakal.
Vikramaditya the great patron appreciated the
beautiful Pallava temple built by Rajasimha at
Kanchipuram, and literally imported almost
the same sculptors to beautify his temples like Virupaksha, 
simulating the architecture at Kanchipuram.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rashtrakuta & Hoysala</i></strong></div>

The Rashtrakutas who succeeded the
Chaulkyas were great builders. The most
magnificent work of them include rock-cut
temple the Kailasa. The Hoysalas continued the
tradition of the later western Chalukyas.
Vishnuvardhana's greatest contribution is the
charming embellished temples with exquisite
sculptures in Belur and Halebid besides others.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vijayanagara Period</i></strong></div>

The Vijayanagara period is indeed a great
phase in Indian culture where the Chalukyan
and Chola tradition combined. Krishnadevaraya, the great emperor flanked by his
queens as depicted in metal at Tirupati, will ever
be remembered as the builder of several temples
including the famous ones for Vithala and
Krishna at Hampi, his capital. One of the great
and imposing Gopuras at Chidambaram has a
fine portrait of Krishnadevaraya.
<br>
<br>
The bronzes of the Pallavas are famous and
among them the most important are perhaps Tripurantaka
with a single pair of arms in the Sarabhai
collection. The eightarmed Nataraja from Nallur and Somaskhanda from Triuvalangadu are
equally noteworthy. Among the Chola ones, the beautiful Parvati, Nataraja
from Triuvarangulam, Vrihbhantika and Devi from Tanjavur and
Ardhanarisvara form Truvengadu, are all exquisite.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Modern Indian Sculpture</i></strong></div>

The range of production of contemporary
sculptors both in material and style is very wide.
But the works are of comparatively smaller
dimensions since the sculptors have not had the
opportunity to work on a monumental scale.
The traditional materials- wood, metal and
stone are still in vogue. Metal has become a
usual material over the last decade or two and
is used in different ways. Lost wax (cire perdue)
is traditionally practiced in Orissa and is called
Dokhra. Mira Mukherjee of Calcutta is a well
known sculptor using this technique.
<br>
<br>
Balbir Singh Kotta, Ram Sutar, Grish Bhatt,
Narayan Kulkarni and Sarbari Roy Chaudhary
have presented their works in bronze. Original
compositions in bronze are usually somewhat
limited in size because of the cost and difficulties
of casting. Carved wood is one of the oldest
traditions in India. In olden days the carving
was restricted in relief. Modern sculpture has
shown an appreciation of wood grain and the
use of its lined and smooth surfaces and flowing
contours.
Stone, cement, plaster and similar heavy
metals have a ponderability and palpability
which make them eminently suitable for
sculpture. These can be either modeled or carved.
The present type of modeling in clay and working
in plaster were introduced by the British in
Indian art schools as also drawings and working
from casts. Plaster was used and continues to
be used mostly in the art schools during the
training of sculptors. Its lack of durability makes
it unsuitable for permanent monuments.
Baroda, Delhi and Calcutta are centres for
training young sculptors. The artists naturally tend 
to concentrate in these towns.
