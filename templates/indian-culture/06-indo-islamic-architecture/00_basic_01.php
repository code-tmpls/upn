<h3>Indo-Islamic Architecture</h3>


In the seventh and eighth centuries CE Islam
spread towards Spain and India. Islam came to
India, particularly, with Muslim merchants,
traders, holy men and conquerors over a passage
of six hundred years. Although by the eighth
century CE, Muslims had begun to construct in
Sind, Gujarat, etc., it was only in the early
thirteenth century that large scale building
activity was begun by the Turkish State,
established after the Turkish conquest of northern
India.
<br>
<br>
By the twelfth century India was already
familiar with monumental constructions in
grandiose settings. Certain techniques and
embellishments were prevalent and popular,
such as trabeation, brackets and multiple pillars
to support a flat roof or as small shallow dome.
While arches were shaped in wood and stone,
these were unable to bear the weight of the top
structure. Now, however, the arcuate form of
construction was introduced gradually in which
arches could support the weight of the domes.
Such arches needed to be constructed with
voussoirs (series of interlocking blocks) and
fitted with keystones. The domes resting on
pendentives and squinches enabled spanning of
large spaces leaving the interiors free of pillars.
A noteworthy aspect of these migrations
and conquests was that Muslims absorbed many
features of local cultures and traditions and
combined them with their own architectural
practices. Thus, in the field of architecture a mix
of many structural techniques, stylised shapes,
and surface decorations came about through
constant interventions of acceptance, rejection
or modification of architectural elements. These
architectural entities or categories showcasing
multiple styles are known as Indo-Saracenid or
Indo-Islamic architecture.
<br>
<br>
According to E. B. Havell Hindus conceived
manifestations of God everywhere in multiple
forms as part of their religious faith whereas a
Muslim thought of only one with Muhammad
as His Prophet. Hence, Hindus adorned all
surfaces with sculptures and paintings. Muslims
forbidden to replicate living forms on any
surface, developed their religious art and
architecture consisting of the arts of arabesque,
geometrical patterns and calligraphy on plaster
and stone.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Typologies of Structures</i></strong></div>

Keeping in mind religious and secular
necessities, architectural building like mosques
for daily prayers; the Jama Masids, tombs,
dargahs, minars, hammams, formally laid out
gardens, madrasas, sarais or caravansarais, Kos
minars, etc. were constructed over a period of
time. These were thus additions in the existing
types of buildings in the sub-continent.
Architectural edifices in the Indian subcontinent, as elsewhere in the world, were
constructed by wealthy people. They were in
descending order, rulers and nobles and their
families, merchants, merchant guilds, rural elite
and devotees of a cult. In spite of the obvious
Saracenic, Persian and Turkish influences, IndoIslamic structures were heavily influenced by
prevailing sensibilities of Indian architectural
and decorative forms. A lot depended on the
availability of materials, limitations of resources
and skills and the sense of aesthetics of the
patrons. Although religion and religiosity were
very important to people of medieval India, as
elsewhere, they borrowed architectural elements
liberally.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Categories of Styles</i></strong></div>

The study of Indo-Islamic architecture is
conventionally categorized into the Imperial
style (Delhi Sultanate), the Provincial Style
(Mandu, Gujarat, Bengal and Jaunpur), the
Mughal Style (Delhi, Agra and Lahore) and the
Deccani Style (Bijapur, Golconda). These
categories help in understanding better the
specificities of architectural styles rather than
putting them in immutable slots.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Architectural Influences</i></strong></div>

Amongst provincial styles, the architecture
of Bengal and Jaunpur is regarded as distinct.
Gujarat was said to have a markedly regional
character for patrons borrowed elements from
regional temple traditions such as toranas lintels
in mihrabs carvings of bell and chain motifs,
and carved panels depicting trees, for tombs,
mosques and dargahs. The fifteenth century
white marble dargah of Shaikh Ahmad Khattu
of Sarkhej is a good example of provincial style
and it heavily influenced the form and decoration
of Mughal tombs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Decorative Forms</i></strong></div>

These forms included designing on plaster
through incision or stucco. The designs were
either left plain or covered with colours. Motifs
were also painted on or carved in stone. These
motifs included varieties of flowers, both from
the sub-continent and places outside, particularly
Iran. The lotus bud fringe was used to great
advantage in the inner curves of the arches.
Walls were also decorated with cypress, chinar
and other trees as also with flower vases. Many
complex designs of flower motifs decorating the
ceilings were also to be found on textiles and
carpets. In the fourteenth, fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries tiles were also used to surface the
walls and the domes. Popular colours were
blue, turquoise, green and yellow. Subsequently
the techniques of fessellation (mosaic designs),
and pietra dura were made use of for surface
decoration particularly in the dado panels of the
walls. At times lapis lazuli was used in the
interior walls or on canopies. Other decorations
included arabesque, calligraphy and high and
low relief carving and a profuse use of jalis. The
high relief carving has a three dimensional look.
The arches were plain and squat and sometimes
high and pointed. From the sixteenth century
onwards arches were designed with trefoil or
multiple foliations. Spandrels of the arches were
decorated with medallions or bosses. The root
was a mix of the central dome and other smaller
domes, chatris and tiny minarets. The central
dome was topped with an inverted lotus flower
motif and a metal or stone pinnacle.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Materials for Construction</i></strong></div>

The walls in all buildings were extremely
thick and were largely constructed of rubble
masonary, which was easily available. These
walls were then cased over with chunam or
limestone plaster or dressed stone. An amazing
range of stones were utilized for construction
such as quartzite, sandstone, buff, marble, etc.
Polychrome tiles were used to great advantage
to finish the walls. From the beginning of the
seventeenth century, bricks were also used for
construction and these imparted greater
flexibility to the structures. In this phase there
was more reliance on local materials.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Forts</i></strong></div>

Building monumental forts with
embattlements was a regular feature in medieval
times, often symbolizing the seat of power of a
king. When such a fort was captured by an
attacking army the vanquished ruler either lost
his complete power or his sovereignty. This was
because he had to accept the suzerainty of the
victorious king. Some examples of strong complex
edifices which still exercise the imagination of
the visitor are the forts of Chittor, Gwalior,
Daulatabad, earlier known as Devgiri and
Golconda.
<br>
<br>
Commanding heights were utilized to great
advantage to construct forts. These heights gave
a good perspective of the region, strategic advantage for security, unfettered and unhindered space to make residential and official
complexes while simultaneously creating a sense
of awe in the people. Other complexities woven
into such topography were concentric circles of
outer walls as in Golconda, so that the enemy
had to breach these at all stages before getting
in.
Daulatabad had several strategic devices to
confound the enemy such as staggered entrances
so that gates could not be opened even with the
help of elephants. It also had twin forts, one
within the other but at a higher elevation and
accessed by a complex defense design
arrangement. One wrong turn in the labyrinth
or complex pathway could lead to the enemy
soldier going in circles of falling to his death
several hundred feet below.
<br>
<br>
The Gwalior Fort was invincible because its
steep height made it impossible to scale. If had
had many habitations and usages. Babur, who
did not find much merit in many things he saw
in Hindustan, was said to have been overawed
at the sight of the Gwalior Fort. Chittorgarh
bears the distinction of being the largest fort in
Asia and was occupied for the longest length of
time as the seat of power. It has many types of
buildings including stambhas or towers to signify
victory and bravery. It was replete with
numerous water bodies. Innumerable acts of
heroism have been associated with the principal
people in the fort, forming the substance of
many a legend. An interesting aspect associated
with forts is that within the palace complexes
stylistic and decorative influences were absorbed
most liberally.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Minars</i></strong></div>

Another form of stambha or tower was the
minar a common feature in the sub-continent.
Two most striking minars of medieval times are
the Qutub Minar in Delhi and the Chand Minar
at Daulatabad Fort. The everyday use of the
minar was for the azaan or call to prayer. Its
phenomenal height however symbolized the
might and power of the ruler. The Qutub Minar
also came to be associated with the much
revered saint of Delhi. Khwaja Qutbuddin
Bakhtiyar Kaki.
<br>
<br>
The Qutub Minar, built in the thirteenth
century, is a 234 feet high tapering tower
divided into five storeys. The minar is a mix or
polygonal and circular shapes. It is largely built
of red and buff sandstone with some use of
marble in the upper storey's. It is characterized
by highly decorated balconies and bands of
inscriptions interwined with foliated designs.
Chand Minar, built in the fifteenth century
is a 210 feet high tapering tower divided into
four storeys. Painted peach now, its facade once
boasted of chevron patterning on the encaustic
tile work and bold bands of Quranic verses.
Although it looked like an Iranian monument it
was the combined handiwork of local architects
with those from Delhi and Iran.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tombs</i></strong></div>

Monumental structures over graves of rulers
and royalty was a popular feature of medieval
India. Some well known examples of such
tombs are those of Ghyasuddin Tughlaq.
Humayun, Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, Akbar
and Itmaduddaula. According to Anthony
Welch, the idea behind the tomb was eternal
paradise as a reward for the true believer on the
Day of Judgement. This led to the paradisiacal
imagery for tomb construction. Beginning with
the introduction of Quranic verses on the walls,
the tomb was subsequently placed within
paradisiacal elements such as a garden or near
a body of water or both, as is in the case of the
Taj Mahal. Surely though, such vast expanses
of structured and stylized spaces could not have
been intended only to signify peace and
happiness in the next world but to also showcase
the majesty, grandeur and might of the person
buried there.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sarais</i></strong></div>

A hugely interesting feature of medieval
India was the sarais which ringed cities and
dotted the vast space of the Indian subcontinent.
Sarais were largely built on a simple square or
rectangular plan and were meant to provide
temporary accommodation to Indian and foreign
travellers, pilgrims, merchants, traders, etc. In
effect, sarais were public domains which
thronged with people of varied cultural
backgrounds. This led to cross-cultural
interaction, influences and syncretic tendencies
in the cultural mores of the times and at the level
of the people.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Structures for Common People</i></strong></div>

One of the architectural features of medieval
India was also a coming together of styles,
techniques and decorations in public and private
spaces of non-royal sections of the society.
Theses included buildings for domestic usage,
temples, mosques, Khanqahs and dargahs,
comme-morative gateways, pavilions in
buildings, and gardens, bazaars, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Early Muslim Architecture</i></strong></div>

After Muhammad Ghori returned, Aiback
established himself as the ruler of Delhi and
almost immediately commenced work on the
earliest extant mosque on Indian soil the
Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque which is the core of
the famous Qutub complex south of New Delhi.
Qutb-ud-din had neither the time nor the
resources to import artisans, masons and
architects form his native Afghanistan. In his
haste to build, Qutb-ud-din had blocks of stones,
columns and lintels removed from existing
Hundu and Jain temples in the area, and had
them reorganized around a rectangular court,
haphazardly assembling the essential rudiments
of a mosque at the site he had chosen. This has,
subsequently, been termed as an "archaeological
miscellany". However, it sowed the seeds of a
tradition of give and take between the austere
traditions of Islam and the sculptural skills of
the local masons and Muslim overseers.
<br>
<br>
Ala-ud-din Khilji, who ruled in the early
14th century, built the city of Siri near the Qutb
complex. Though almost nothing of Siri has
survived, his Alai Darwaza at the Qutb complex
marks the beginning of a process of refinement
of the basic module of Muslim architecture.
Once this basic module had been perfected and
the new technological principles of the true arch
and the dome understood by Hindu builders,
this module could be assembled in varying
combinations to build mosques, tombs, places,
markets and entire cities.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Tughlaq Architecture:</b>
The Tughlaqs, who ruled Delhi form A.D.
1320 to 1413, endowed their new cities with a
genuine Muslim flavor. This is clearly evident in
the fortress cities of Tughlaqabad and Firoz
Shah Kotla founded by Ghias-ud-din and Firoz
Shah, respectively. They made deliberate attempt
to combine the principle of the arch and beam
in their buildings. Hauz Khaas and Kotla built
by Firuz Tughlaq are fine examples of it. The
Tughlaqs were also responsible for creating a
rather militant style of architecture characterized
by sloping, fortress-like walls studded with
buttresses and circular pylons.</li>
        <li><b>Turkish Architecture:</b>
The Turks used the arch and dome on a
wide scale. The style of decoration was in
accordance with their religious beliefs. No human
or animal figures were used since it was
considered to be unislamic. They used scrolls of
flowers & geometrical forms and verses of
Quran Sharif which were intertwined in a very
artistic manner (Arabesque). The Turkish rulers
used both the dome and arch method and the
slab and beam method in their buildings. They
also freely borrowed Hindu motifs such as the
bell motif, swastika, lotus etc. The Turks added
colour to their buildings by using red sandstone.
They also used yellow sandstone or marble.
In Gujarat and its environs, however, the
Muslim rulers seem to have been completely
swamped by the artistic skills of the local Jain
and Hindu craftsmen. In sharp contrast in the
south, Muslim immigrant well versed in Persian
technology arrived by sea and building activity
in this region displays a strong structural bias.
Beginning with a large mosque at Gulbarga, this
tradition culminated in the building of the
famous Gol Gumbaz at Bijapur, the largest
dome of its time.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Sayyids and the Lodi dynasty
held nominal sway over the cities of Agra and
Delhi in the north and, during their rule, the
dominance of Muslim structural techniques were
well established with the construction of massive
boat kneel shaped domes over the numerous
tombs built at Delhi by the Lodi rulers, whose
buildings had virtually turned Delhi into a royal
necropolis.</li>
        <li><b>Lodi Architecture:</b>
During this period, both the arch and lintel
and beam were used. Besides balconies, kiosks
and caves of the Rajasthani-Gujarati style were
also used. Another device used by the Lodis was
placing their buildings, especially tombs, on
high platforms thus, giving the buildings a
feeling of size as well as a better skyline. Some
of the tombs were placed in the midst of gardens
e.g. Lodi Garden. Some of the tombs were of
octagonal shape.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mughal India</i></strong></div>

During the reign of Babar, magnificent forts,
palaces, gates, public buildings, mosques, baolis
(water tank or well), etc. were built, There were
many formal gardens with running water. Use
of running water in palaces and pleasure resorts
was a special feature of the Mughal architecture.
Dome, arch, perforated jail work, inlay
decoration and artistic calligraphy were the
other special features of the architecture of the
period. Nishat Bagh in Kashmir, Shalimar in
Lahore and Pinjore garden in the Punjab foothills
are the gardens laid out by Babar.
The Mughal Empire, however, was founded
as much on Babar's endeavors as on the genius
of the great Afghan ruler, Sher Shah, who
forced Babar's son Humayun to relinquish Delhi
and ruled the land for a fruitful fifteen years. He
contributed handsomely to architectural
traditions. While the balanced perfection of the
Quila Kuhana Masjid in the Purana Quila at
Delhi became the prototype upon which the
Mughals developed their structures, his tomb at
Sasaram in Bihar was indeed a fitting climax to
the series of octagonal tombs erected by the
Tughlaqs and the Lodis. Its builder Aliwal Khan
conceived a fine elevation unity of the square,
the octagon and the sphere.
<br>
<br>
With the arrival of Akbar on the Indian
scene an era of unparalleled building activity
began. Under his benevolent but powerful
guidance, all that was best in the building
tradition of India came to life. During Akbar's
rule, Persian ideas were blended with Hindu
and Buddhist traditions to produce a style as
unique and eclectic as the personality of Akbar.
This is seen at its best in Humayun's tomb at
Delhi, in the numerous structures at Akbar's
new capital city of Fatehpur Sikri and at his
own tomb at Sikandra in Agra. Fatehpur Sikri
is a palace cum-fort complex. It includes many
buildings in the style of Gujarat and Bengal. The
mixture of styles, both Hindu and Muslim, was
given unity by the material used for all the
buildings, red sandstone, quarried from the very
ridge on which the city was erected. Another
contribution of Akbar to the Indian architecture
is the Red Fort at Agra. Built of red sandstone,
it had many magnificent gates. Diwan-i-Am
and Diwan-i-Khas were added to it by Shah
Jehan. The Jahangiri Mahal in the fort is a fine
building attributed to Akbar himself. Panch
Mahal, built by Akbar, is five-storied structure
of open pavilions. All types of pillars used in
various temples, were employed to support its
flat roofs.
<br>
<br>
The Buland Darwaza is another significant
contribution of Akbar. It is 170-ft. high structure
which commemorates Akbar's triumphal return
from his Deccan campaign. The style, in which
it was built, was called half-dove portal. A
dome was sliced into half. The sliced portion
provided the massive outward facade of the
gate while smaller door could be made in the
rear wall where the dome and the floor met. The
style, borrowed from Iran, later became a
common feature in Mughal buildings.
Akbar's son Jahangir was not a prolific
builder, preferring to express his creativity in
the laying out of numerous Mughal gardens,
and in replacing the dignified austerity of Akbar's
sandstone architecture with the flamboyance
and luster of pure white marble. An outstanding
contribution of Jahangir to Indian architecture
is the Tomb of Akbar at Sikandrabad. Towards
the end of Jahangir's reign, began the practice
of putting up building entirely of marble and
decorative walls with floral designs made of
semi-precious stones. This method of decoration
is called pietra dura; it became more popular
under Shahjahan who used it on a large scale
in the Taj Mahal.
<br>
<br>
Shahjahan was a passionate builder in
sandstone and marble and so, he took the
traditions of Mughal architecture to their
climactic best in the famous Taj Mahal at Agra.
But before the Taj was built, Shahjahan's
craftsmen had mastered the use of marble as a
building material in structures such as Diwani-khas and Diwan-i-Aam, the halls of private
and public audience, and the Moti Masjid or
Pearl Mosque at the Agra Fort. The Taj Mahal
was placed at the head of the garden rather
than at centre, creating a rich dimension of
depth and perspective to the first view of this
perfectly proportioned edifice. The four minarets
that surround the central structure provide a
spatial frame for the arched facade and the
soaring dome. There are minimum decorations,
delicate marble screens, pietra dura inlay work
and kiosks, adding to the effect. The double
dome is another feature of the building. It was
designed by a Persian Ustad Isa.
<br>
<br>
With the growing wealth of the empire,
Shahjahan laid out the splendid city of
Shahjahanabad, at Delhi. For the devout, there
is the perfectly proportioned Jama Masjid just
opposite the fort. This mosque, the Taj Mahal
and the palaces of Shahjahan in the Red Fort
at Delhi are proof of the swan song of Muslim
architecture in India. Jama Masjid is built in red
sandstone. A lofty gate, tall slender minarets
and a series of domes are its important features.
Moti Masjid in the Agra Fort which is built like
the Taj, entirely in marble is another example of
Shahjahan's passion for the use of marble in
buildings.
<br>
<br>
The Mughal Empire continued under the
orthodox rule of Shahjahan's son Aurangzeb
for another sixty years. However, under his
austere rule no great work of art or architecture
was created and with the disintegration of the
Mughal Empire, the focus once again shifted to
regional centres such as Oudh in present day
Uttar Pradesh where a rather florid style based
on the whims of the ruler rather than any
architectural principles emerged. Safdarjang's
Tomb was built by Nawab Shuja-ud-Daula of
Awadh. Gol Gumbaz was built by Sultan
Mohammad Adil Shah of Bijapur. The
foundation of the Golden Temple was laid by
Guru Ram Das and completed by his son Arjun Dev.
