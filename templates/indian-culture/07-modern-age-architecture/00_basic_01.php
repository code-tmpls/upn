<h3>Modern Age Architecture</h3>

Europeans built strong fortresses and
imposing churches. The forts had no architectural
significance, but the churches had. The
Portuguese at Goa established impressive
churches in the style of Iberian architecture. The
English built churches resembling the English
village churches.

Victorian style, being imitative rather than
original, did not have a vitality of its own. The
Victorian architects in India further debased
themselves by attempting to copy oriental styles
while trying to construct public buildings. Big
brick work buildings with iron supports and
domed roofs represented Victorian architecture
at its worst examples - Churches of Calcutta
and Madras, the cathedrals of Simla and Lahore,
the High Courts at Lahore and Calcutta etc.
When Sir Edwin Lutyens and his colleague
Sir Edward Baker were appointed to carry out
the grand design of a new imperial capital, they
grudgingly embellished major buildings with
motifs and artifacts borrowed from Indian
traditions. The basic forms, however, remained
uncompromisingly Western. Viceroy's palace
appeared with a huge dome on the lines of a
Buddhist stupa. A demerit of the experiment to
synthesize the different styles of Indian
architecture within a broader European fabric
was that simplicity, modernity and utility were
considerably compromised for the purpose of so
called beauty and structural majesty. Most of
the structures appeared massive, heavy and
strong, but also congested, close and even
medieval.

After India achieved independence in 1947,
Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister, called for
the development of a truly Indian architecture.
What resulted at first were awkward imitations
of the past and this prompted Nehru to both call
for a vital style of contemporary Indian
architecture and to commission the Frenchman
Corbusier to build the city of Chandigarh, a
new capital for the state of Punjab. Corbusier
planned Chandigarh as an integrated scheme of
sectors, each a functional entity in itself. Corbusier
set the pattern for what is known as Indian
architecture, which took its cues from the west
and laid great stress on rationality, functionalism
and economy.
