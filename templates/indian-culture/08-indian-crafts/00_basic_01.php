<h3>Indian Crafts</h3>

In traditional Indian society there was no
sharp distinction between 'art' and 'craft'. The
Sanskrit word shilpa has been used to mean
skill, craft, work of art or architecture, design or
decoration. A simple earthen pot used for
fetching water was as much Shilpa as the stone
image of the deity worshipped in a temple.
Traditionally the craftsman himself was the
designer of his item and received full emolument
for his product. The introduction of the alien
concept of the designer as distinct from the
craftsman has, as pointed out by Pupul Jayakar,
destroyed the craftsmen's natural response to
form goods. The traditional skills are still alive
in many pockets of India. Wherever a local
clientele has existed fine craft tradition has
survived.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Clay and Terracotta</i></strong></div>

Clay craft is considered man's first
craftsmanship. Domestic pottery is in profusion
and found in an innumerable forms from any
Indian scene. Despite the paramount role played
by domestic earthenware it is its religious
association that gives it far wider dimension
and status. Each region has a number of gods
and goddesses to be worshipped at special
periods and on special occasions. One may
classify those under three heads: the figurines of
deities, ceremonial pottery and votive offerings.
The first is understandable; the second type
includes lamps for Diwali, toys for Dusserah,
etc. and the votive offering are a substitute for
sacrifices for they consist of a variety of clay
animals, offered either in fulfillment of a vow,
for warding off some disease or for obtaining
some favour.
<br>
<br>
Blue pottery is the traditional earthenware
of Delhi. The Jaipur blue pottery is equally
famous, but is unique, for the base is prepared
out of the material from which the slip is made
and no clay is used. Alwar is noted for its paper
thin, almost sheer body pottery, known as
Kagzi pottery. The Nohar centre of Bikaner is
famous for the pottery tinted with lac colors to
which the gold shade is added.
In U.P., Khurja's pitchers, Rampur's surahis
and Nizamabad's earthenware are quite famous.
Saurashtra has Chandan like clay called
gopichandan which provides glows of a buring
buff to articles. Goa earthenware with its red,
velvety surface has a charm and style of its own.
Karigiri pottery in South Arcot is unique in
many ways. Pottery from Karukurichi in
Tirunelveli district is popular. Kashmir has its
earthenware of ordinary clay but with a glaze
like surface. Potters from Gujarat form a big
colony at Dharavi, Bombay. Khanapur in
Belgaum district of Karnataka is known mostly
for its large size container and jars.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Metal Work</i></strong></div>

Copper was the earliest non-ferrous metal
used by man to make tools. The metal was light
and corrosion-resistant. In course of time copper
and tin were mixed to produce a new alloybronze. The statue of a dancing girl, discovered
at Mohenjo-Daro dated around third millennium
B.C., with its intricate but elegant carring,
shows that cire perdue process was already
perfected.
<br>
<br>
Like earthenware, Indian metal ware can
also be divided into three groups: religious
images, ritualistic items and objects of utility.
The most common metals used are copper, brass
and bell-metal. Brass is an alloy of copper and
zinc. Bell-metal is a mixture of copper and tin.
Moosaris are the traditional artisans engaged
in bell metalware and belong to one of the six
classes of Kammalars. Kammala means the
maker of an article pleasing to the eye.
Nachiarkoli in Thanjavur district of Tamilnadu
is important centre for metalcrafts. Guwahati
and Sarbari are important centres in Assam.
Manipur is well known for its bell-metal,
particularly the ceremonial artifacts by the cire
perdue casting. A special type of dish is known
as Krishna Kanti.
<br>
<br>
Uttar Pradesh is the largest brass and copper
making region in India. The range of items is too
large. Etawah, Varanasi, Sitapur, etc., have
their own characteristic domestic wares. In
Varanasi icons are also cast. Srinagar, a small
village, makes very beautiful traditional images
with prominent conch shell eyes. Ritualistic
items like tamrapatra, panch patra, sinhasan
and Kanchanthal are also produced in large
numbers.
Tamilnadu is one of the famous bronze
producing states. Stylistically the images made
conform to periods like Pallava, Chola, Pandyan
and Nayaka. The artisans are known as stapathis,
literally icon-makers. Swamimalai in Thanjavur
is best known for image making in stone and
bronze, both.
<br>
<br>
Kerala is famous for its statuary, chief centres
being Trivandrum, Payyanoor in Cannoure
district and Angadipuram in Palaght district.
Kerala makes a different version of Shiva's
tandava dance- gaja Tandava or Gajasanhara
in which Shiva crushing the demon in the
elephant form.
Koftagiri is inlaying of a light metal on a
dark one, technically known as damascening. A
wide range of article is produced in this technique
both for ornamental purpose and for utility.
Elegant picturisation is also done sometimes in
Koftagiri. At present it seems to be practiced
mainly in Kerala. Bidri is also a type of
damascening. The original home of bidri is
Bidar in Karnataka. The metal wire inlay work
known as tarkashi was originally from Mainpuri,
a little place in Uttar Pradesh. Here brass wires
are used in place of Pieces.
<br>
<br>
Kashmir is famous for metal engraving.
Hukka bases of various shapes are the pride of
Kashmiri crafts. The Himalayan foothills have
a lovely copper metalware in Ganga-Jamuni
style that is a blending of brass and copper in
the same article with a little German silver in it.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Stoneware</i></strong></div>

Excavations reveal carving of stone figures
3000 year old. India is blessed with a very large
variety of stones. Granite, the granular rock,
seems to have been the earliest in stone to be
useful to man. Stone monuments are, thus,
fairly common all over the country.
Midnapur district in West Bengal is an
important traditional region for stoneware and
the main centre in Simulpal. The practicing
craftsmen are karga, bhumif and karmakar. The
stone here though called "potstone", is really
phyllite. Agra in Uttar Pradesh is world famous
for its marble work flowering under the aura of
the Taj Mahal. Vrindavan near Mathura in
Uttar Pradesh has marble as well as alabaster
products.
<br>
<br>
Sculpture of Mauryan period proves that
Bihar has an ancient tradition in stone carving.
The most noted stoneware centre of Bihar is
Patharkatti in Gaya district. The craftsmen are
Gaur Brahmins. Buddhist icons are a specialty.
Singhbhum and Santhal Parganas are also
famous for their beautifully grained greenish
black soap stone.
Rajasthan is the land of marble. Makrana in
Nagaur district is the major source of its marble.
Rajasthan is particularly noted for its ornamental
stone work. The green spotted copper coloured
tamrastone found in Sawai Madhopur is used
for making images. A soft shaded stone from
Dungarpur, which turns black when oiled, is
also used in icon-making.
In Orissa, monuments like the famous
Konark, Bhubaneshwar temples are testimony
to the genius of the craftsmen dating back to the
famous Kalinga School. Puri is an important
centre for stonework. Its specialty is figurines.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Wood Carving</i></strong></div>

As suggested by the earlier construction of
stone railings at the stupas of Sanchi and the
windows and ceilings of some of the early
western Indian cave temple and monasteries,
wood was the predecessor of stone in Indian art
and architecture. Being a soft material available
in plenty, almost all over India, there is hardly
any region where wood carving has not existed.
By using teak, shisham, deodar, sandal wood,
ebony, walnut, sal, etc. and employing the
techniques of caring, inlaying, veneering,
painting and lacquering, the wood carvers of
India have developed intricate fixtures for
architecture and produced fine furniture, cabinet
work, chests, etc.
<br>
<br>
Kashmir has the soft toned elegant walnut
and the facile deodar wood that have guided
the craftsmen's deft fingers into delicate lines
and decorative motifs. Kashmir produces a
countless variety of the most alluring objects
with lovely grain and natural colour, and
tastefully executed, with great attention to
minutest details. Kashmir is particularly noted
for its fine lattice work screens as also caskets.
Gujarat is one of the richest regions in wood
carvings. The dominant feature is the entrance,
the door or the arch. The doors have delicate
lattice work and the pillars are decorated by
half roundels or floral friezes. Blocks for textile
printing carved out of teakwood are made in
Pethapur in Mehsana district of Gujarat.
Assam being thickly forested has an ancient
tradition of woodwork. The state is known for
a special type of wooden house called namghar
or Kritanghar, besides producing finely carved
chests for storing everything from ornaments of
vessels.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Painting on Wood</i></strong></div>

Painted door have been a distinctive hall
mark of Rajasthan. In the village of Bassi items
meant for rituals are gaily painted with the
Gangaur figures. Andhra Pradesh has wooden
boxes, containing village deities, finely decorated
with paintings in folk style using mainly red,
blue and yellow colors. Fine specimens of painting
on wood can be seen in some of the Kerala
churches which, rich in wood-carvings, are
often embellished by appropriate colors. A
special technique in metal plating has been
evolved whereby thin sheets of gold and silver
are so applied that the entire piece appears as
if it were made of these precious metals Best
examples of this are seen in Gujarat in the
Vaishnava temple or Jain households.
Ahmedabad has craftsmen versed in this
technique.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lac Turnery</i></strong></div>

This craft is essentially Indian. Lac is an
animal resin which is applied on to wood in dry
state due to heat generated by friction. The
lathe-turner, found almost all over India,
prepares on this lathe: toys, boxes, bed-posts,
hukkah mouth-pieces, etc. In etched lac work,
the object is coated with first one colour, then
on the top of second, a third or a fourth,
uniformly all over. Then with a fine chisel or
styles the lac coated surface is scratched, the
hand being made to move lightly or to press
heavily as may be necessary to bring out the
colour required from the numerous layers
beneath the surface. Ferozepur, Jaipur and
Hoshiarpur are the famous centres of this craft.
Bighar and Orissa too have a distinct type
of lacquering with their own designs and colour
schemes. The lac articles in Bihar have ritualistic
value e.g. during the marriage the vermillion
container has to be of lac. The community that
makes these containers is called laheri.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ivory</i></strong></div>

Caning, painting and staining ivory is a
highly value art of India. In India the craft has
confined itself only to the tusks of elephants.
Most of the ivory has to be imported from Africa
which are considered closer in texture. In India
ivory is used for as number of purposes from
sacred images to dies. There is a record of even
an ivory workers guild in Vidisha in Madhya
Pradesh.
<br>
<br>
Delhi is one of the main centres for ivory
carving. Popular items are chess sets, billiard
balls, mathematical scales and small articles like
scent bottles, compact cases, paper knives, saltpapper cellars, book-marks, trinket or pan boxes,
and a number of jewelry items.
Kerala has become the renowned centre for
ivory carving. The noted items is statues,
especially the medium sized figures, designed in
super dignity, and such perfect form that they
are a delight to look at no matter from which
angle you view.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cane and Bamboo</i></strong></div>

The North Eastern states of Manipur,
Meghalaya, Arunachal and Nagaland are
endowed with rich natural wealth of cane and
bamboo. In most of these areas almost anything
that might be required for daily life-from
dwellings to utensils and ornaments -can be
manufactured from these materials. A hoard of
baskets, mats, screens, fish-traps, bags, boxes,
hat, trays, umbrellas are made from fine chips
of bamboo.
<br>
<br>
The finest and most delicate bamboo fibre
products appear to be creations on canvas.
Bihar is greatly noted for its bamboo work. Cane
furniture is durable as also decorative and
dignified, and even a few pieces lend fullness to
a room. Low seats called mooras are made of
bamboo and cane, the top being woven in
artistic designs. They are major item of export
and made all over the country. Assam is well
known for its canwork. Uttar Pradesh also
produces articles made of canes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Puppetry</i></strong></div>

There are many types of puppets in India.
Those in practice today are string, rod, glove
and shadow. String puppets are found in Andhra
Pradesh, Rajasthan, Orissa, Tamil Nadu,
Karnataka; rod puppets in Bengal; and glove
puppets in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The Indian
puppets have a wide range of variety as they
differ in form and colour from place to place.
Karnataka has a very special bombeyatta
(doll show) based on the popular folk music
drums called yakshgana. The puppet figures
have ball and socket joint to facilitate movements.
These are shaped out of light wood capable of
smooth surfacing. The wooden frame has joist
at the neck, shoulders, elbows, hips and knees.
Tamil Nadu has a well known tradition in
marionettes known as bomalatta. The technique
combines the string and the rod puppets. One
of the specialties of this bomalatta is their dance
pieces which the puppets perform beautifully.
The play of wooden puppets in Andhra
Pradesh is called Koyabommalata,
Kathaibommalata, Keelubommalata, according
to each regional dialect. The marionettes are
string -manipulated.
<br>
<br>
The marionettes of Rajasthan known as
Kathputli are among the liveliest. The traditional
puppeteers were known as bhatts. The puppets
are of small size. Normally the puppets have no
legs. Music is provided by the women in the
family members, who sing to the accompaniment
of the dholak. The themes are taken from
Rajasthani historical tales or local legends.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Revival and Development</i></strong></div>

To give a new lease of life to the dwindling
handicrafts situation in the country the
Government of India set up the All India
Handicrafts Board in 1952. Regional Design
Development Centers were set up by State
Handicrafts and Handlooms Development
Corporations. The Crafts Museum, which
functions under the office of the Development
Commissioner (Handicrafts), has a collection of
1500 representative samples of the glorious
traditions of Indian crafts.
