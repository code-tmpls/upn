<h3>Dances</h3>

The contemporary Indian classical dance
forms which are governed by elaborate
technique and stylized system of both pure
movement and "mime" have had their origin in
the dances of the common people.
Five dance styles are known as classical or
art dance on account of a sophisticated degree
of stylization. The history of these forms can be
traced backward beyond two hundred,
sometimes three hundred years. Each has a link
with the literature, sculptural and musical
traditions of the ancient and medieval period of
India and the particular region. They all adhere
to the principles enunciated by Bharata, namely
of the division of dance into nritta (pure of
abstract dance), nritya (dance with mime), of
tandava and lasya of stylized presentation
(natyadharmi). However, the technique of
movement is distinctive, with a definite
stylization. Each follows a different set of rules
for the articulation of movement.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bharatnatyam</i></strong></div>    
        
Bharatnatyam developed in south India
particularly in Tamilnadu in its present form
about two hundred years ago. While its poses
are reminiscent of sculptures of the 10th century
onwards, the thematic and musical content was
given to it by the musicians of Tanjore courts of
the 18th -19th centuries. It is essentially a solo
dance and had close affinities with the traditional
dance-drama form called Bhagvata Mela
performed only by women. Nonetheless, its
chiseled sophistication and stylization make it a
unique form of art-dance.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kathakali</i></strong></div>    
        
Kathakali from Kerala is classical dance
drama. Unlike the others, it is dramatic rather
than narrative in character. Different roles are
taken by different characters; the dancers are all
men or were so, till recently. It takes epic
mythological themes as its contents, and portrays
them through an elaborate dramatic spectacle
which is characterized by an other-worldly
quality, a supernatural grandeur, a stylized
large size costume to give the impression of
enlarging human proportions, and a mask like
make up on the face which is governed by
complex symbolism of colour, line and design.
Character types, such as heroes, anti-heroes,
villains, demons, sages, kings, all have a
prescribed makeup and costume to give the
impression of co-relating basic e.g. green with
good, red with valor and ferocity, black with
evil or primitiveness, white with purity, and so
on.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Why is it not a drama?</i></strong></div>

Within the framework of drama with
dramatic personage, Kathakali is dance-drama
and not drama, because the actors do not speak
their lines. The dramatic story is carried forward
through a highly evolved vocabulary of body
movements, hand gestures and eye and eye-ball
movements. The vocalist recites, narrates, and
sings the lines of the dramatic piece; the actor
on the stage portrays the meaning through this
elaborate language where he has freedom to
improvise and interpret the dramatic line. He
makes departures and deviations freely like the
dancer of any other styles. Also like the dances
of the other styles, the mime (abhinaya) is
interspersed with pure dance sequences (nritta).
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kuchi Pudi</i></strong></div>    
       
It is a form of classical dance popular in
Andhra Pradesh. It was a dance-drama
performed by the Brahmins in the temple. It was
confined to males. Sidhendra yogi, in the 14th
century revived this form of dance. He composed
the Bhama Kalpam. The efforts of Laxmi
Narayan Shastri and Vedantam Satya Narayan
resulted in bringing in females to participate in
this dance form. Carnatic music forms the
background in this dance. The dance has lasya
and tandav elements and is a mixture of folk
and classical from. Of late flute, violin, manjiras
are being used in this dance. The main modern
exponents of this dance are Raja and Radha
Reddy, Chinta Krishnamurti, Yamini
Krishnamuriti, Swapna Sundari, Shobha Naidu,
Pashumarti vithal etc. a famous aspect of the
dance is that the dance is performed with the
feet kept on brass plate and also dancers drawing
pictures on the floor with their toes.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mohiniattam</i></strong></div>    
        
Mohiniattam is one of the distinctive classical
dance styles of India. It originated in Kerala and
the movements of Mohiniattam evoke in one's
mind the ethereal splendor of Kerala with its
lush venture, lagoons, the purple hills and a
land kissed by the foams of turquoise sea waters.
This form had almost become extinct when it
was revived by poet Vallathola Narayana Menon
in early 19th century. Since then, dancers have
striven to reclaim the lost repertoire of
Mohiniattam. The main features of Mohiniattam
are its exquisite feminine charm and its graceful
swaying movements. It is a solo dance performed
by women only.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kathak</i></strong></div>    
        
Kathak, from north India, is an urban
sophisticated style full of virtuosity and intricate
craftsmanship. Commonly identified with the
court traditions of the later Nawabs of northern
India, it is really an amalgam of several folk
traditions. Its origins are old, its present format
new, attributed to the genius of Nawab Wajid
Ali Shah and the hereditary musical dancer,
Pandit Thakur Prasadji. The contemporary
repertoire was evolved by a few families of
traditional dancers; during the last hundred
years. Birju Maharaj is the greatest living
exponent of this dance form.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Manipuri</i></strong></div>    
        
Manipuri is a lyrical dance form from the
eastern region of India. Although many forms of
ritual, magical, community and religious dance
were known to Manipur before the advent of
Vaishnava faith in the 18th century, the dances
known as the Rasa dances evolved only as a
result of the interaction of the Vaishnava faith.
The origin of the Rasa dances is attributed
to the vision of a king. Be that as it may, five
different types of ballets, with a well-conceived
structuring of Corps de ballet, solo pas de deux
revolving round the theme of Radha-Krishna
and the Gopis (milk maids) comprise the large
part of the classical repertoire.
The second group of the classical dances is
known as the Sankritanas, performed generally
by men with typical Manipur drums called
pung or cymbals (Kartals) or clapping. At large
variety of intricate rhythmic patterns is played
on the drum and the cymbals. The Nata
Sankritana often precedes the Rasa.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Odissi</i></strong></div>    
        
Odissi is a close parallel of Bharatnatyam. It
developed from the musical play and the dances
of gymnasiums known as the akharas. Sculptural
evidence relating to the dance goes to the
second century B.C. From the 12th century
onwards there are inscriptions/manuscripts and
other records which speak of the prevalence of
dance styles of ritual dances of temples and
entertainments of the village squares. A 12th
century poetic work called Gita Govinda has
dominated the poetic and musical content of the
dance styles. The dance was performed by
women called maharis in the temple of
Jagannath. Later, men dressed as women, called
gotipuras, performed these dances in the
courtyard of the temple. The present Odissi is
a solo form evolved out of all the above. It has
been revived during the last two decades. Sonal
Mansingh is the greatest living exponent of this
dance form.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Folk Dances of India</i></strong></div>

There is not a region, a valley or mountain,
a sea-coast or a plain, which does not have its
characteristic folk dances and songs. Roughly
speaking, depending on the level of social and
cultural development, these dances can be
grouped under the three categories of tribal,
village folk and traditional ritual dances.
A tribal belt runs through all parts of India,
be it the Himalayas from the north to the east,
or the plains and marshlands or the sea-coasts.
All these varied groups comprising many racial
and ethnic strands ranging from the Austric to
the Mongoloid, from the Aryans to the
Dravidians, are people who represent the preagricultural state of civilization. While most of
them, have taken to agriculture and tool
cultivation today, their dances and music
continue to recall the functions of hunting,
fishing, food gathering and animal husbandry.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Dances of the Plains</i></strong></div>    
        
The richest amongst these are the dances of
the Ho's and Oraons of Jharkhand, the Marias
of Bastar and the Santhals of Bengal. Kaksar is
a typical festival dance performed by the
Abhujmarias before reaping a harvest. The
instruments used are dhol (cylindrical drum),
timiki (bowl-shaped percussion instrument) and
bansuri (a kind of flute).
<br>
<br>
Close to the lush marshland of Madhya
Pradesh and yet very different, are the tribes of
Jharkhand. Amongst these the Ho's and Oraons
are rightly famous for their vigor and vivacity.
Dance and rhythm runs through the veins of
the Oraons of Jharkhand. Men and women vie
with each other in creating choreographical
patterns of extreme complexity and intricacy.
Jadur and Karma dancers of the Oraons celebrate
a series of festivals, which start in March and
end in June. All these dances are essentially
harvest dances meant as a prayer for the
betterment of the crop. These dances are also an
abstraction of the everyday agricultural
operations of the people. The dancers are usually
graceful and the dances have a very well defined
structure. The musical instruments consist of
nagara (bowl-shaped drum), kartal (clappers).
The leader hold a staff of peacock feathers and
the drummers (medal players) join the dance at
various points.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Himalayan Dances</i></strong></div>    
       
From the northern Himalayas region come
many dances which belong to the village
communities. Himachal and Uttarakhand are
the home of many interesting and colourful
dances. The popular favourites come from
Jaunsa Bawar in Uttarakhand. The festival of
lights called Diwali is celebrated throughout
India at the end of autumn. On a dark night
light are lit and presents are exchanged. This is
also the time for the home-coming of married
women. The dance begins with semi-circular
formations: it breaks into single files of men and
women. The song which accompanies is usually
set as questions and answers. With gliding
movements, graceful knee dips, the dance
progresses, until one or two amongst the women
proceed to the centre to rotate dishes on their
fingers or sometimes pitcher full of water turned
upside down over their heads. So perfect is the
balance that not a drop of water trickles out of
the pitchers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The musical instruments resemble those used
by the dancers of Himachal Pradesh, comprising
narshingha (a large trumped), brass bells, barrel
shaped percussion instruments and bowl-shaped
drums.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Description of some Folk Dances</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>'Bhangra' of Punjab</i></strong></div>    
        
In the Punjab, a virile agricultural dance
called the Bhangra is popular and is closely
linked with the ritual importance which is given
to wheat. After the wheat crop is sown, the
young men gather together in an open filed
under the light of the full moon. The dancers
begin to move in a circle, so that as many new
comers who wish to join can do so without
breaking its continuity. The circle goes on
widening until a large open circle is formed
with the drummer as the leader.</li>
        <li>Bihu
It is a Folk dance of Assam. Its ancient form
is traced to the tradition of the Aranyaka dance.
The kachari and Kacchari tribes perform this
dance, thrice each year.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Bohag bihu: This dance is performed to
mark the first day of the New Year.</li>
        <li>Magha Bihu: When the paddy ripes, this dance
is performed to symbolize joy and prosperity.</li>
        <li>Baisakh bihu: This dance is performed in
baisakh. It is purely performed for joy and
has no religious connotation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pandvani</i></strong></div>    
        
It is a folk dance of Chhattisgarh in Madhya
Pradesh. It is a solo dance where the performer
holds an Ektara and sings with body movements.
The dance is linked to the story of the pandavas.
The performer sings and acts to tell the story of
the pandavas. This dance has two forms i.e.
vedamati and kupalika. Tijan bai, Ritu verma,
Jhaderam Devangan, Gulabdas Manikpuri are
some of its modern exponents.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Videsia</i></strong></div>    
        
It is a folk dance of the Bhojpuri speaking
areas of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The dance
was invented by one Bikhari Thakur. In modern
times, this dance has taken the form of drama.
It is presented through song and dance. The
main purpose besides entertainment is to create
awareness against social evils.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chhau</i></strong></div>
            
It is war dance of the tribes of Bihar, Bengal
and Orissa. There are three famous school of this
dance namely saraikela, purrulia and Mayurbhanj.
Basically, it is a male dance. The themes of this
dance include epics and incidents from ancient
texts. Except in the Mayurbhanj School, the dancers
wear a mask moulded from mud. It is ceremonially
performed during the sun festival.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Modern Dances</i></strong></div>

Understandably, the confrontation of the
comparatively dramatic styles such as Manipuri,
Kathakali and folk forms with western influences
produced a new form of dance in the 20th
century which has been loosely termed as
Modern dance. Uday Shankar, its founder, had
met and danced with Anna Pavlova when he
was himself unacquainted with the Indian
tradition. Later he returned to India to create,
to recreate, revive and to break away from the
set norms of the tradition. While he borrowed
freely and successfully from all styles, what he
created was his own, unrestricted to any
traditional mannerism, unbound to the meterical
cycle and the word- mime relationship.
Contemporary themes, labour and machinery,
the daily rhythm of life were chosen in addition
to myth and legend. Unlike traditional schools
dance was composed first, music accompanied.
It did not govern. Gradually a whole school
grew up as the Uday Shankar School of Dance.
Most modern choreographers belong to this
school: the most talented amongst these was
Shanti Bardhan (died 1952), the creator of two
remarkable ballets called Ramayana and
Panchatantra. In each, while the theme was
old, the conception and treatment was totally
new. In one the format is that of a puppet play
presented by humans in the other typical
movements of birds and animals.
<br>
<br>
Chandralekha is India's most talented
iconoclast, original choreographer and radical
thinker. She welds martial arts movement into
a dance that even as it is focused on the body,
it seems to transcend it and unlock the gateway
to an inner space of great beauty. Chandralekha
has used Bharat Natyam dancers back to back,
that too a male and a female in movements
symbolic with the yoni and the lingum. The
notable productions are Navagraha Angika,
Lilavati, Shree, Prana and Bhinne Pravaha.
All this shows that these development did
not leave the traditional dancers unaffected.
Without departing from the norms of the
particular stylization, dance-dramas (sometimes
called ballets in India) have been created in
practically all styles including Bharatnatyam,
Manipuri, Kathak, Kuchipudi and Odissi. The
Themes continue to be rooted in the tradition for
the most part. But there are refreshing departures
and innovation.
