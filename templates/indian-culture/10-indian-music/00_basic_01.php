<h3>Indian Music</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Raga</i></strong></div>

Raga may not be the earliest form of melody.
The earliest melodies can be traced in the tribal
and folk music. The simple tunes of these people
in the course of times, after much polishing and
formalization, became ragas.
Matanga (6th-8th centuries) deals with ragas
in his work Brihaddesi. He opined that no
classical melody could be composed with less
than five notes. At that time less than five notes
were used in tribal music. Thus a process of
dramatization of folk and tribal music started in
5th century A.D.
<br>
<br>
The earliest forms of music with a grammar
were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Margi Sangeeta</li>
        <li>Gandharva Sangeeta</li>
        <li>Desi Sangeeta</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Samaveda, the sung version of Vedas, was
chanted in a descending progression. This
ecclesiastical melody was known as margi
sangeeta.
<br>
<br>
Gandharva Sangeeta was a highly
grammatised music. It was an upa-veda. This
form of music has been described in Ramayana,
Mahabharata, Puranas and Budhist and Jain
texts. Desi Sangeeta was not that strict as far as
the grammar was concerned. The nature of the
music varied from regions to region, hence the
word desi.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Characteristics of Raga</i></strong></div>

A minimum number of five notes are
necessary to gain the status of raga. The upper
limit is seven. In Hindustani music nine notes
are quite common. But in carnatic music more
than seven notes are rare.
It is usual to attribute a particular season
and time to ragas. Some of the important
seasonal ragas are Vasant and Malhar. The first
is of the spring and the second is of rains.
A Hindustani raga has been ascribed to the
watch of the day. The day is divided into eight
praharas, each of three hours. Lalit is sung in
the early moring. Poorvi is sung during dusk.
A few ragas (usually six) have become the
major ones, each with a few wives (raginis). The
raga becomes a nayaka (hero) and the ragini a
nayika (heroine).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Jatis</i></strong></div>

Jatis were the precursers of ragas. A jati was
defined by ten rules or gramma. The scale to
which a Jati could be ascribed was called the
moorchana. This system seems to have been in
practice from about 600 B.C. Amsa was the
most important note in Jati.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tala</i></strong></div>

Tala is a rhythmic arrangement of beats in
a cyclic manner. Each cycle is complete in itself
and is repetitive. The cycle is divided into
sections which may or may not be equal. It is
formed by the addition of time units in a defined
manner. The closed or cycled arrangement
differentiates tala from rhythm. According to
ancient texts there are hundred and eight talas.
The more common talas now in vogue are:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Carnatic</i></strong></div>

1. Adi Tala
<br>
2. Jhampatala
<br>
3. Roopaka Tala
<br>
4. Misra Champu Tala
<br>
5. Khanda Chapu tala

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hindustani</i></strong></div>

1. Keharuva
<br>
2. Dadra
<br>
3. Deepchandi
<br>
4. Chautal (used in dhrupad and dhamar)
<br>
5. Dhamar
<br>
6. Roopak
<br>
7. Jhaptal
<br>
8. Ektal
<br>
9. Jhumra
<br>
10. Trital
<br>
11. Tilvada
<br>
<br>
The breakdown of the ‘up and down’
movement yields the ‘notes’ (swaras) and a
series of swaras arranged in a certain order
within certain limits is a scale (saptaka, grama,
mela). The interval between the ‘repetitive’
pitches is called an octave or in Indian
terminology ‘saptak’. The word octave is used
because the eighth note is a ‘repetition’ of the
first. The saptak signifies that there are seven
steps within the span of an octave. The range
of an octave is known as sthayi.
<br>
<br>

The ancient Vedic scale was described in
terms of the profane (flute) scale as early as the
first century A.D. by Narada. The following
table gives the scale in current terminology:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Forms of Indian Music</i></strong></div>

Musicians in India can invent numerous
musical structures with a raga and tala. These
structures can either be closed or open. Closed
ones are called nibaddha. Open ones are called
anibaddha. Nibaddha follows tala and has
words- meaningful or meaningless- and definite
parts with preset beginning and end or in other
words one can call it a “composition”. Anibaddha
on the contrary may not follow tala and may
be devoid of words.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Anibaddha Forms</i></strong></div>

<b>Alapa:</b> Alapa is the most important
anibaddha music. Whether a musician is adroit
in his art or not is tested through his alapa.
Alapa, the most elaborate and most delicate
presentation of raga, demands much patience
and sentitivity in rendering. In Karnatak music,
Alapa always precedes the composition. In case
of Hindustani music it may or may not precede
the composition.
<br>
<b>Tans:</b> Tands, like alapa, is anibaddha as
they are not pre-composed. In Hindustani music,
particularly in instrumental music, they are
termed as plats.
<br>
<b>Neraval:</b> In Karnatak music, the bole tan
has its equivalent – the neraval. The difference
between the two being that a bole tan can be
placed anywhere in a composition whereas
neraval is placed at certain recognized sections
of the song.
<br>
<b>Sangati:</b> It resembles with neraval. Tyagaraja
is the inventrr of this technique. The sangati is
slight variation of a phrase of song which is
preconceived. Neraval or the bole tan is extensive.
It doesn’t exist in the north.
<br>
<b>Sargam:</b> The Sargam is a word formed of
syllables Sa-Re-Ga-Ma in Hindustani Music. In
Carnatic music it is Kalpana Swara. It is also
free rendering and practiced more often in
Carnatic music.
<br>
<b>Jode and Jhala:</b> These are confined to
instrumental music. The Jode is a rendition,
without tala, or the raga in a medium tempo.
It always follows the alapa. Jhala is faster.
<br>
<b>Tanam:</b> It is found in Karnatak music and
is similar to jode. It is not as wider in its melodic
range and movement as jode.
<br>
<br>
Alapa, Jode and Tanam always precede the
closed form or composition. Tan, neraval and
bode tan etc. form the parts of melodic
improvisation of a composition. These are not
independent like the former group, as they are
associated with the variations of the raga theme
in a song. One may then argue they are closed
forms. But being not pre-composed nor set to
tala we place them in the category of ‘free’ or
‘open’ class. They are essential part of musical
jugalbandi.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nibaddha Forms</i></strong></div>

Prabandha: It is one of the earliest formal
structures. This form of ‘composition’ was
popular till about the middle age. But today, the
word prabandha means any song and not a
particular type. Jayadeva, a mystic poet and the
court-poet of Raja Lakshamana Sena, is famous
for his prabandhas. He wrote Geet Govinda, a
musical rendering of the love play of Lord
Krishna.
<br>
Geeta Govinda: It is an ‘opera’ organized
into twelve chapters. Each chapter is further
sub-divided into twenty four divisions called
Prabandhas. The prabandhas contain couplets
grouped into eights, called Ashtapadis. The
astapadi has eight (asta) sections or feet (pada).
Each section is set in a raga and a tala, perhaps
the first work where these are mentioned. From
the 15th century onwards the Geeta Govinda
was the only music performed in Jagannath
temple at Puri; it became popular all over Indian
and caught fancy of fancers and painters. The
literary structure is simple. It is amenable to any
style of music. It was one of the finest products
of Bhakti movements.
<br>
Dhrupad: It is one of the early types that are
still surviving. The older ones were known as
dhruva prabandhas. Raja Mansingh Tomar of
Gwalior and Akbar were great patrons. The
15th and 16th centuries witnessed the finest
singers of dhrupad.
<br>
<br>
The style is characterized by masculinity in
nature as these are rendered in ragas only and
not raginis. The rendition is less grave in melodic
progression. Great stress is laid on rhythmic
variations. It is one of the most serene and sober
forms of music.
Dhamar is always associated with dhrupad.
Approach and technique are same; the two
differ on the use of gamaka. There is greater
freedom in gamaka in Dhamar.
<br>
<b>Exponents:</b> The most famous are Svami
Haridas and Tansen. Svami Haridas lived at the
end of the fifteenth century. He was basically a
bhakti singer and sang of Kunj Bihari, the Lord
of Brindavan and his love, Radha. He has
hundred compositions to his credit. Baiju and
Tansen are believed to be his shishyas. Pt. Jasraj
is the greatest living exponent of this style.
Tansen lived in Gwalior in 16th century. His
original name was Tanna Misra. He is credited
with new ragas such as Darbari Kanada, Miyan
ki Malhar, Miyan ki Todi. He wrote three books:
Sri Ganesh-stotra, Sangeet Sar and Raga mala.
<br>
Khayal: The word Khayal is Persian. Its
meaning is ‘imagination’. Amir Khusrau (13th
century) is said to be the inventor of khayal. It
is the most popular form of vocal music in north
India. Two types of Khayal are in vogue the
bada (large) and the chhota) small.
<br>
<br>
<b>A Khayal can be divided into two sections:</b>
the asthayi (sthayi) and antara. Khayal is
romantic and delicate. In technique and structure
it has certain freedom not found in the dhrupad.
It is due to the efforts of Sultan Mohammad
Sharqui (18th century) that the Khayal came in
prominence and became accepted as ‘classical’
from the time of Sadarang Nyamat Khan (18th
century). The most prominent gharanas of
Kheyal are four: Gwalior, Agra, Jaipur and
Kirana. The first is the oldest and is also
considered the ‘mother’ of all other gharanas.
<br>
<br>
Thumri: It is a closed form and a way of
singing, very popular in the north. It is a very
light form, extremely lyrical. The sentiment is
usually erotic; dealing with emotion of love and
romance. The word of the song and how it is
expressed through musical modulations are
more important than the grammar of the raga.
Ragas like Kagi, Khamaj, Peelu and Bhairavi
and the common favourites of thumri singers.
Poorab style of singing is popular in Varanasi
and Lucknow. Punjab style of singing is more
mercurial and can be heard in and around
Punjab.
<br>
<br>
This form is associated with Radha Krisna
bhakti cult. It forms an important form of
Kathak dance. Thumri was extremely popular
in 19th century with its centre at Lucknow.
Wajjid Ali Shah was a composer of fine thumris.
The song Babul mora in Bhairavi raga is said to
have been created by him on the eve of his
departure from Lucknow. The other school of
Varanasi borrows much from folk forms like
Chaiti and Kajri.
Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, who is also
considered as greatest classical singer recorded,
was great exponent of this style. Presently Pt.
Channu Lal Mishra and Shobha Gutru are
considered greatest living exponent of this style
of gayaki.
<br>
<br>
Tappa: It is a type of singing supposed to have
grown from the songs of the camel drivers of
North-West India. It is romantic in content with
very quick cascades and cadences. The ragas are
of lighter type-Kafi, Bhairavi and such others.
Tarana: It is a form which has no meaningful
word. Sthayi and antara are there. Its libretto
is made of syllables like nadir, tome, tarana,
yalai without any semantic reference. It is
generally accepted that these syllables are
mnemonies of tabla and sitar strokes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Light Classical Music</i></strong></div>

Gazal: The origin is Persian. The themes
revolve around ‘love’. These are generally
composed of 5-13 couplete (shere) which are
independent. Same melodic theme is applied to
all the couplets for a particular Gazal
composition. Some of the famous exponents are
Master Nadan, Begum Akhtar. Mehdi Hassan
Gulam Ali, Jagjit Singh, Anup Jalota, Pankaj
Udhas and Talat Aziz.
<br>
<br>
Qawwali: This is a devotional song sung in
a group, but with a solo voice against a chorus.
It was developed by Amir Khusro for his teacher
Hazrat Nizzamuddin. Due to international fame
its greatest exponent Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali
Khan this musical style has achieved world
fame. Today his nephew Rahat Fateh Ali Khan,
Sabri Brothers and Wadali brothers are
considered greatest qawwali singers.
<br>
<br>
Soofiana Kalam: This is highly grammatical
and has well set rhythmic structure. This form
is popular in northwest India (present day
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Indian Punjab, Kashmir
and Rajasthan). Most famous kalams were
written in Panjabi. Heer is most famous Kalam
written by sufi saint Warris Shah, apart from
him Bulle shah’s Kafis are still sung by sufis
today.
<br>
<br>
Keertan: It literally means ‘to sing the praises
of’ is a typically Vashnavaite congregational
singing of Bengal. Starting from Chaitanya
Mahaprabhu (1485-1533) it blossomed out into
many varieties. Today the legacy still survives in
form of Baul music in Bengal region of India and
Bangladesh.
<br>
<br>
Rabindra Sangeet: Rabindranath Tagore
used Indian ragas and talas from Indian classical
music. He was also influenced by western music.
He created various mixed ragas (mixed) like
Bhairava-Bhairavi; Darbari Todi-Bhairavi and
created new talas such as Navami and Roopaka.
Bhajan: Bhajans are sung throughout the
north in the praise of the Lord. Narsi Mehta of
Gujarat, Meera, the Princess of Mewad, Kabir,
Tulsidas were the chief exponents. It is most
popular form of devotional music among
Hindus.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gharanas</i></strong></div>

The word Gharana has its root in the Hindi
word Ghar (from the Sanskrit Word grah). It is
an abstract noun of ghar meaning ‘of the
house’. Right from the earliest times, there have
always been different schools of music in our
country. After Akbar, music did not occupy the
place of importance, and gifted musicians all
over north Indian were absorbed into different
native states. The rulers of these states were
generally averse to their musicians travelling to
other states. This isolation produced a kind of
musical conferment. The enforced isolation gave
the musicians no alternative method but to
vigorously practice whatever they knew and to
develop even greater refinement and subtlety.
In the present age of easy movement from place
of place, the abolition of princely states, the
general tendency towards abandoning all
barriers or limitations, and the facilities of radio
and television, the modern generation of
musicians cannot remain tied to any particular
gharana. Today, we have an integrated, eclectic
style of music.
<br>
<br>
Qawwal Bache Gharana: This gharana is
said to be the first of its kind in the stylization
and dissemination of Khyal and Khyal gayaki.
The famous exponents were Savant and Bula
(brothers), Shakkar Khan, Bada Mohammad
Khan and his three brothers and sons -all were
exponents of Khayal. The thirds son, Mubarka
Ali Khan, had the greatest success and learnt
the most from his father. Another musician was
Sadiq Ali Khan who lived in the time of Nawab
Wajid Ali Shah of Lucknow
<br>
<br>
Atrauli Gharana: Atrauli is a village about
fifty miles from Aligarh in western Uttar
Pradesh. This Gharana was founded by two
brothers Kali Khan and Chand Khan. The
Gharana is famous for its Dhrupada School, but
Khayal singing is the latest fad.
Dullu Khan and Chhajju Khan were two
Dhrupada singers who sang Gauhar Bani. Other
exponents are Husain Khan, Shahab Khan,
Ghulam Ghaus Khan, Zahoor Khan, Imam Bux,
Ajmat Hussain Khan, Ustad Alladiya Khan,
Haidar Khan, Bashir Khan, Burji Khan, etc.
Ustand Alladiya Khan is the brightest jewel of
this Gharana. Kishori Amonkar is the only
daughter of the famous singer Mogubai Kurdikar
of Bombay. She is one of the most gifted singers
among women today in the north.
<br>
<br>
Gwalior Gharana: This gharana originated
from Abdullah Khan and Kadir Baksh Khan,
who were brothers. They were reputed singers
of Khyals. After that came the two sons of Kadir
Baksh-nathan Khan and Pir Bux. The two
brothers settled down permanently in Gwalior
and trained their sons Haddu Khan. Other
exponents are Pandit Vishnu Digambar
Paluskar, Anant Manohar Joshi, Ingle Bua,
Anna Bua, Mehdi Hussain Khan, Onkar Nath
Thakur, Vanayanrao Vyas, B.R. Deodhar and
others. Gravity and sobriety are important
features of this Gharana.
<br>
<br>
Agra Gharana: Agra Gharana, it is believed,
had two branches the first sprang from Syamrang
and Sarasarang and the other from Imdad
Khan. The school of Imdad Khan gravitated
towards light music. The other branch of the
Agra Gharana, which began from Imdad Khan,
faded away in the early part of the century.
Moreover, many of the musicians of this branch,
despite good training in Khayal, took a greater
liking for Thumri, Dadra and other lighter
varieties. For instance, after Imdad Khan and
Hamid Khan, Pyar Khan, Latif Khan, Mahmud
Khan and Raja Hussain were all known primarily
as Thumari singers.
<br>
<br>
Saharanpur Gharana: This Gharana is
believed to have begun from Khalifa Mohammad
Zama, who was a well-known Sufi. After him,
there were several great musicians in this
gharana. Bande Ali Khan, the famous veena
player, Bahram Khan, Zakruddin Khan and
Allabande Khan, Nasiruddin and Nasir
Aminuddin Dagar, and Nasir Zahiruddin and
Nasir Faizuddin Dagar (Younger brothers) were
some of the reputed musicians who kept this
style in prominence. This gharana specialized in
alapa Hori, and Dhrupada.
<br>
<br>
Sahasvan Gharana: This Gharana is an
offshoot of the Gwalior Gharana. It began with
Inayat Hussian Khan, the son-in-law of Daddu
Khan of Gwalior. Of the several musicians of
this gharana, four have been outstanding: Inayat
Hussain Khan, Haidar Khan, Mushtaq Hussain
Khan and Nisar Hussain Khan. Its gayaki is
akin to Gwalior gayaki.
<br>
<br>
Delhi Gharana: This gharana traces its
origin to Tansen but, according to some, this
was founded by Miyan Achpal in the 19th
century. Some other great musicians of the
Gharana were Sadiq Khan, Murad Khan,
Bahadur Khan, Dilwar Khan, Mir Nasir Ahmed,
Panna Lal Gosayin, Noor Khan, Vazir Khan,
Ali Bakesh Khan, Mohammed Siddiqis Khan
and Nisar Ahmad Khan.
<br>
<br>
Fatehpur Sikri Gharana: It did not become
a well known gharana. It claims its origin from
the time of the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. This
gharana is said to have started with two brothers,
Zainu Khan and Zorawar Khan, who were
great Dhrupada and Khayal singers. After these
two brothers Dulhe Khan was a very good
musician. Other great names are Chhote Khan,
Ghulam Rasul Khan and Madar Bux and
Sayyad Khan. Most of the singer followed the
dhrupada style.
<br>
<br>
Khurja Gharana: This gharana began in the
18th century with Nathan Khan and his son
Jodhoo Khan. Imam Khan was the son of
Jodhoo Khan. He was followed by his son
Ghulam Hussain. Zahur Khan and Ghulam
Haidar Khan, son of Ghulam Hussain continued
the traditions of this gharana. The last of the
ustads in this gharana was Ustad Altaf Hussain
Khan.
<br>
<br>
Jaipur Gharana: This gharana is nearly 160
years old. The most famous exponent was Rajab
Ali Khan. Other greats were Sawal Khan
Mushraf Khan, Mujahid Ali Khan, Sadiq Ali
Khan, Jamaluddin Khan, Shamsuddin Ali Khan,
Abid Hussain, Amir Bux, Muhammad Ali Khan
and Ashiq Ali Khan.
<br>
<br>
Bhendi Bazaar Gharana: Famous ustads
are Nazir Khan, Ghajju Khan and Aman Ali
Khan. Shivkumar Shukla and Ramesh Nadkarni
are the pupils of Aman Ali Khan. The most
significant characteristic of this gharana is that
it specializes in Madhyalaya Khayal. The
exponents of this gharana seldom sing Vilambit
Khayals.
<br>
<br>
Kirana Gharana: This gharana claims its
origin from the famous binkar Ustad Bande Ali
Khan. It was recognized after Ustad Abdul
Wahid Khan and Ustad Abdul Karim Khan
claimed to belong to it. Other exponents are
Suresh Babu Mane, Swami Gandharva,
Gangubai Hangal, Giranbai Barodekar, Sarasvati
Rane, Bhimsen Joshi, Feroz Dastur, Shakur
Khan and Pran Nath. This gharana specializes
in singing the swara as accurately as possible.
<br>
<br>
Rampur Gharana: This gharana is also an
offshoot of the Gwalior Gharana. It was founded
by Ustad Wazir Khan. Other exponents were
Inayat Hussain Khan, Bahadur Hussain and
Mohammad Ali. The contemporary exponents
are/were Ishitiaq Hussain Khan, Nisar Hussain
Khan and Ghulam Mustafa. The main features
of the gharana are similar to those of Gwalior
with the difference that there is specialization
in taranas.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Carnatic Music</i></strong></div>

The word ‘Carnatic’ was coined by
Vidyaranya in the fifteenth century. He served
Vijayanagar Kingdom as prime minister.
However, Carnatic denotes south Indian music
distinct from the Hindustani music.
This form of music has been influenced
greatly by the old Dravidian (Tamil) music. A
study of the Structure of its present forms (Kriti,
Kirtanam, Varnam, Padam, Javali) makes it
amply clear that this music is maintaining the
ancient traditions of the prabandhas more closely
and rigidly than Hindustani music.
<br>
<br>
The rigid fidelity to the composition inevitably
inhibits improvisation. These are more precise in
the rhythmic patterns and elaboration on Tala
in Carnatic music than there is in Hindustani
music. This result in the limitation in the scope
for rhythmic variation and the same patterns
have to be repeated again and again. The
manner of interpretation and the shift of
emphasis from structural bondage to free
improvisation in Hindustani music is one of the
main differences between the two.
Stalwarts of Carnatic music
Jalapakkam Annamacharya of Andhra
pradesh is believed to have conceived Kirity
from of composition, which consists of pallavi,
anupalavi and charanam. Purandardasa, who
hailed from Maharashtra, is said to have
composed 475,000 songs (according to his own
reference in the dasarpada). He developed the
Kriti, which has just been introduced by
Jallapakkam. He also composed the earliest
lakana gitas and other vocal exercise.
The immortal Trinity of Carnatic music,
Thyagaraja, Syama Sastrya and Muthuswami
Dikshita, were born in the later half of the
nineteenth century. The greatest of them was
undoubtedly Thyagaraja. He would make
several compositions in Raga so as to explore
thoroughly its various musical potentialities. He
also introduced what are known as sangatis.
These are beautiful variations of phrases
occurring in Kritis. The post-Trinity period
witnessed many stalwarts setting traditions and
different styles. Some of the important names
are Patnam Subramani Lyer, Poochi Srinivas
Lyengar, Veena Dhanam, Triukodikaval Krishna
lyer (violin), Subrama Diksatar (musicologist
and Vainikar), Konerirajapuram Vaidyanatha
lyer, Kumbakonam Azhagunambi Pillai
(Mridangam), Sarabha Sastri (flute) and
Pudukkottai Daksinamurti Pillai (Mridangam
and Kemjira).
<br>
<br>
Veena Dhanam is the quintessence of
Carnatic music. Her style was handed down to
her daughters who, in turn, passed it on to their
daughters. Her grandchildren are Brinda and
Mukta (Vocal), Balasarswati (Bharatnatyam)
and Vishwanath (flute). The family is the best
exponent of the Padams. Other great names are
T.R. Mahlinam (Mali), T. Viswanatham (Viwam),
and the violinists M.S. Gopalkrishan, T.N.
Krishanan and Lalgudi Jayaraman.
<br>
<br>
<b>Hindustani and Carnatic Music:</b> A
comparison
Firstly, there are several ragas in both styles
which have identical swaras but which sound
very different. This happens because the
oscillations of notes are much faster in Carnatic
music than in Hindustani music.
The Hindustani and Carnatic systems are
very different in regard to Tala. The latter
follows the old tradition in its nomenclature,
division and structure. The main elements of
Carnatic Tala are laghu, druta, anudruta, guru,
pluta and Kakapada. The Hindustani Tala
system uses a different terminology, but it is also
founded on a seven tala base. The internal
divisions of the Talas are also different from
those of Carnatic music.
<br>
<br>
The Khayal made tremendous strides on
improving the melodic structure of Hindustani
music, opening vast avenues of improvisation
and enhancing the aesthetic element. But what
it gained in the sphere of melody and aesthetics,
it lost in the sphere of Tala.
Just as South Indian music does, Hindustani
music also employs the three Kalas, which are
wrongly termed laya in the north. Laya is used
in Indian music, in the sense of both tempo and
rhythm; the term Kala, which is still in vogue
in South Indian music, is more appropriate.
As far the evolution is concerned, it is almost
same for both. From Naradiya Siksa onwards,
both trace their evolution through Sama Veda
music and prabandha. The divergence becomes
marked from A.D. 1960 with the emergence of
the great work Chaturdandi Prakasika of
Venkatamakhin, son of Govinda Dikshatar.
To conclude, it may be inferred that the
manner of interpretation and the shift of
emphasis from structural bondage to free
improvisations in Hindustani music is one of the
main differences between the two.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kriti:</b> Kriti is the finest compositional type.
The word Kriti means “that which is made or
created”. The musical structure is of greater
significance. The text is always religious. If
compared with the Khayals, it stands out in the
term of literary value. Also the structural beauty
is better planned than that of the modern
Khayal.
<br>
<br>
The heydays of Kriti were in the 18th century
with the rise of the Trinity: Shyama Shastri,
Thyagaraja, Muttuswami Dikshitra. Swati
Trunal, the Maharaja of Travancore, was also
a composer of some eminence.
<br>
<br>
<b>Musical Instruments:</b>
The importance of instruments and their
history in the overall panorama of music cannot
be ignored. Without them not much musicology
is left. In fact if there were no musical instruments
there might not have been any music theory or
Grammar because there is no way of measuring
vocal sounds directly in the throat itself. Musical
instrument, help us to develop sound-musicology
and study musical scales. Besides, the nature of
musical instruments has profound influence on
the development of our music.
The musical instruments have been classified
as solids, drums, wind instruments and stringed
instruments.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Solids or Ghana Vadya :</b> The most
famous Ghana vadyas are-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Dandiya or Kolu: These are rhythmic
sticks, coloured or plain, with jingles or
without them. In Gujarat they are known
as Dandiya, in south they are known as kolu
and used in a dance called kolattam.</li>
        <li>Dahara or Laddi shah: It is used in Kashmir
valley. It is an iron rod of about three
quarters of a meter length, bent like a
walking stick, having a cross handle and a
number of rings.</li>
        <li>Chudiyan: It is a metallic bangle, which is
struck by a wooden stick.</li>
        <li>Slit drum: it is not a hollow drum but made
of wood. It is called songkong by tribal
Assamese and Longten by the Nagas. It is
used either as an alarm or for dancing. In
the north-east another but portable version
of the slit drum is the tak dutrang made of
Bamboo. Another type is the katola used

</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>Stringed instruments:</b> They are called
Tata Vadya. There are three major classes of
stringed instruments. The first group is employed
not for creating a raga or melody but as drones
and rhythmic adjuncts. The second group
consists of poly-chords on which melody can be
played and finally we have the monochords,
which again may be fretted, fretless, plucked or
howed. Some important ins-truments of the
stringed class are given below:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tuntune: It is commonly used by
mendicants and beggars in south-central
and western India. It has a hollow wooden
cylinder with the bottom of the vessel closed
by parchment. A bamboo piece is nailed or
screwed to the side of the body on the
outside. Between the peg and the leather
bottom of the bamboo passes a single string
which can be tightened or loosened by
twisting the peg.</li>
        <li>Gopi yantra: It is called ektara in Bengal
and Orissa. It is like the tuntune but the
bowl, though cylindrical is wider at the base
and narrower at the upper end. The string
is attached to a bamboo fork whose prongs
are nailed to the outside of the resonator.</li>
        <li>Premtal, Khamak, chonka, Jamidika: The
premtal (Hindi), Khanak (Bengali), chonka
(Marathi) and Jamidika (Telugu) are
modifications of the tuntune and gopi
yantra. The string is plucked by a wooden
plectrum. They are used by snake charmers
and balled singers.</li>
        <li>Buang: The santhals of Orissa use a
rhythmic cordophone called buang. It
consists of a bamboo tube, a resonator and
a rope. The round box is like an egg shaped
basket paste over by paper.</li>
        <li>Tamboora: The major classes of this
instrument are the ekatara and the tamboori.
The ektara is a single stringed instrument. The
resonator is a flat dried pumpking and the
danda or hollow rod holding the string is
attached to it. The rum sagar of Gujarat has
two strings but is still called ektara. The
tamboori is the cruder prototype of tamboora.
The tamboora is also called tanpoora. The
sound box is a large pumpking. A wooden
neck is fixed and a hollow fingerboard is
attached to it. There are four metallic strings
which are plucked with fingers.
The melodic stringed instruments include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Polychords: They are also called ‘veena’.
The villadi vadyam found in kerela and
Tamilnadu are its example. Yazh of the
Tamil country also resembles the veena.</li>
        <li>Santoor: It is used mostly in Kashmir. The
instrument is made of a box of wood,
trapezoid in shape. Over this there are
thirty bridges arranged in 15 rows, two in
each row. A set of four strings of metal
suned to the same note is stretched over
each pair of bridges. Thus the total number
of wires is 60.</li>
        <li>Svaramandal: It is like a santoor but smaller
in size.</li>
        <li>Monochords: The tuila of Orissa, the
kacchapi, rabab, sarod, sitar, kinnari etc are
its examples. The rudra veena and vichitra
veena also fall in this class.
<ol>
    <ul>
    <li>Violins: The Pena of Manipur, Kenra and
banam of Orissa, Kingri of Andhra and
Maharashtra and Veena kunju of Kerala
are examples of violins.</li>
        <li>Bowed instruments: Ravanhatha of
Gujarat and Rajasthan, Kamaicha of
Rajasthan, Sarinda of Bihar and Sarangi
belong to this class.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Popular Western Music</i></strong></div>

<b>Reggae:</b> Jamaican popular music that
developed in the 1960s among Kingston’s poor
blacks, drawing on American ‘soul’ music. Many
of highly political songs of this class proclaim
the tenets of the Rastafarian religious movements.
Springy offbeat rhythm characterizes its sound.
Bob Marley and his group, the Waiters, and
Toots and the Maytals are among the bestknown performers.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rock:</b> A hybrid of black and white American
musical forms; Blues, rhythm and blues, gospel
music, country and western music. In 1955 Bill
Haley’s song ‘Rock, Around the Clock’ set off a rock
‘n’ roll craze because of its exciting, heavy beat and
the urgent calls to dance and action of its lyrics.
Most successful rock artists are Elvis Presley, Beatles,
the Rolling Stones, etc. In the 1970s country rock,
a fusion of country and western and rock ‘n’ roll
grew popular as did Disco.
<br>
<br>
<b>Jazz:</b> American musical form developed
from black worker’s songs, spirituals and other
forms whose harmonic, melody and rhythmic
elements were mainly African. It came to general
notice in the 1920s when whites adapted or
imitated it. Jazz began in the south and spread
northward and westward.
<br>
<br>
<b>Blues:</b> The blues generally employs a 12-bar
construction and a ‘blue’ scale, thought to be
African in origin. Vocal blues have earthy,
direct lyrics, the tempo may vary and moods
range from despair to cynicism to satire. Major
early blues artists were Blend Lemon Jefferson,
Ma Rainy and Bessie Smith.
<br>
<br>
<b>Country Music:</b> It has directly descended
from the folk music of the English, Scottish and
Irish settlers of the south-east US. It tends
towards simpler forms and depicts the life
experience of poor rural and urban whites.
Noted performers are Hank Williams, John
Denver, Kenny Rogers Merle Haggard, Johnny
Cash and Loretta Lynn.
