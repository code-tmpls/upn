<h3>Languages</h3>

Indiaâ€™s unity lies in her diversity and this is
further substantiated by the high degree of
diversity, they have, in their languages and
dialects. They speak various languages and
dialects. The 1961 census has listed 1652
languages and dialects as mother tongues spoken
in India. This figure was arrived at, taking into
account even dialect spoken only by five persons.
The 1971 census gave a more realistic figure of
700, having taken into account the dialects
spoken by 100 people and above. The Indian
constitution has officially recognized 22
languages after taking into consideration their
numerical, commercial, political and cultural
importance.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indo-European Family</i></strong></div>
        
A substantive population of India speaks
one or the other forms of the Aryan languages.
It is the biggest of the languages groups in India,
accounting for about 73 per cent of the entire
Indian population. Aryan Languages are
generally divided into two main branches:
Dardic and Indo-Aryan.
 The Dardic group includes Dardi, Shina,
Kohistani and Kashmiri.
 The Indo-Aryan branch is divided into the
North- Western, Southern, Eastern, EastCentral, Central and Northern groups.
 The North-Western groups include Lhanda,
Kachchi and Sindhi.
 The southern group comprises Marathi and
Konkani.
<br>
<br>
 The Eastern group includes Oriya, Bihari,
Bengali and Assamese. Among the dialects
of Bihari may be included Maithili, Bhojpuri
and Magadhi.
The East-Central group consists of three
main sub-groups:
(a) Avadhi (b) Baghaili and (c) Chhattisgarhi
The central group includes Hindi, Punjabi,
Rajasthani and Gujarati. Hindi or Hindustani
has produced two great literatures, Urdu and
(High) Hindi. Both have the same grammar and
the same basic vocabulary though they differ in
script and higher vocabulary. Hindi uses the
nagari script while Urdu uses the Perso-Arabic
script. Moreover, Hindi has a preference for
purely Indian words while Urdu has numerous
Arabic and Persian borrowings. The Rajasthani
itself consists of several varieties of speeches, the
principal among them being Marwari, Mewari
and Malawi. The speeches that fall in the
Northern group consist of one or other variety
of pahari speeches. They include Nepali, Central
Pahari and Western Pahari. Besides these
languages, Sanskrit, the classical language of
India, represents the highest achievement of the
Indo-Aryan languages. Although hardly spoken
now-a-days, it has been listed as a nationally
accepted language in the 8th Schedule of the
constitution.
<br>
<br>
The Himalayan and the sub-Himalayan areas
are inhabited by the speakers of the various
forms of Pahari and Nepali which belong to the
northern group of the Indo-Aryan languages.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Austric Family</i></strong></div>    
        
The Austric languages of India belong to the
Austro-Asiatic subfamily of languages. Nearly

sub-family of languages is that of Santhali
speakers, who alone account for more than the
half of the total speakers. The speeches of the
Austric family are spoken by the tribal groups
in the Khasi and Jaintia hills of Meghalaya and
the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal, the
predominantly tribal districts of Santhal
parganas, Mayurbhanj, Ranchi, East Nimar,
Betul and Baudh Khnodmahals. Of the two

groups of north-east and of the Himalayan and
sub-Himalayan regions of the North and the
North-West. The speeches of the TibetoHimalayan branch are in Ladakh and parts of

<br>
Article 343 of the constitution provides that
for a period of 15 years from the commencement
of the constitution, the English languages shall
continue to be used for all official purposes of
the Union. It was expected that after the expiry
of the stipulated period i.e. 1965, Hindi would
replace English but till date no definite date has
been fixed for its elimination and replacement
by Hindi. As matters stand, the languages listed
in the constitution remain the official languages
of the respective states, while Hindi and English
continue to be used for inter-State
correspondence and for all India use generally.</li>
