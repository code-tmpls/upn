<h3>Indian Literature</h3>

Like the Indian languages, the history of
Indian literature may conveniently be divided
into two main stages or phases, the old and the
modern. The old is also capable of being subdivided into ancient and medieval, and the
lower limit of this old period has been put down
roughly at 1000 A.D. This is the period when
the Indian people experienced some of the
greatest transformations in its political and
cultural set up. It was about this time that the
North Indian Aryan language took definite
forms, evolving out of the earlier Apabharamsa
and Prakrits.
<br>
<br>
The scholarly and scientific literature of
India continued to be written in Sanskrit even
after the development of the Prakrit or Middle
Indo-Aryan dialects and the Bhasa or Modern
Indo-Aryan speeches. The older literary tradition
was partly religious and partly secular, such as
we find in both Sanskrit and the Prakrits. The
religious literature consisted of Philosophical
disquisitions and narrative poems describing
the legends and stories of the ancient heroes as
preserved in the great epics and the Puranas,
and in the case of the Jainas, in the stories of
religious edification on the lives of the Jaina
saints. The atmosphere of Brahmanism,
Buddhism and Jainism was carried over from
Middle indo-Aryan to New Indo-Aryan.
On the secular side, the literature consisted
of little lyrics of love and life, and the habit of
composing long narrative poems on romantic
legends, which was prevalent in Sanskrit also,
received a new form in the New Indo-Aryan
languages. Modern Indian literature thus started
with in heritance from Prakrit and its later
phase the Apabhramsa, and from Sanskrit, in
Northern India, and in South India, in the case
of Dravidian languages, there was a profound
influence of Sanskrit all through. Although
certain types of literature appeared to have
developed independently in the various
Dravidian languages, particularly Tamil, the
Sanskrit influences became predominant.

An overall picture of the present literary
situation in some of the major languages in
discussed here. Assamese has the same script as
Bengali. There are several young, experimental,
avant garde poets like Navakant Barua, Hem
Barua, Mahendra Bora and other, as well as
fiction-writers like Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya
and Syed Abdul Malik. Social realism is
substituted by regional documentation and
psycho-analytical short stories. Bengali, the
languages of great thinkers and poets, novelists
and essayists like Raja Ram Mohan Roy,
Vivekananad, Aurobindo, Rabindranath Tagore,
Saratchandra Chatterji and so many others, is
considered to be the best of the East and the
West and translation from all world languages
are available in Bengali.
<br>
<br>
After the death of Rabindranath Tagore in
1941, there seemed to be a very big gap in the
field of poetry which is still unfilled, though
Jibananad Das, Buddhadeva Bose, Sudhin Datta,
Bishnu Dev and others did take up their
responsibility. But in the field of fiction, three
Banerjees did remarkable work: Bibhuti Bhushan
Banerjee (Author of Pather Panchalli, the Satyajit
Ray film), Manik Banerji (author of the pupplet’s
Tale) and Tarasankar Banerji. There are many
important names in the field of shorts story and
anthologies in English like Green and Gold
(edited by Humayun Kabir) and Broken Bead
(edited by Lila Ray) are some specimens. Drama,
in spite of Utpal Dutt and Shombhu Mitra, has
not advanced much. The latest trend like the
influence of the Beatniks is seen in “Hungary
Generation” poets like Malay Raichuadhari.
<br>
<br>
After 1904, Oriya came to its own and
novelists like Fakir Moun Senapati and K.C.
Panigrahi discovered in their rural life excellent
gems of extraordinary characters. Poets like
Suchi Raut Ray, Mayadhar, Mansingh and
others were trying their best to light the torch.
Modernism in poetry has come to stay. Gopinath
Mohanti and Raj Kishore Ray tried to break
new grounds in fiction.
Tamil literature has a rich past. Modernity
dawned during 19th century with V. Swaminath
lyer and Subramanya Bharati. Many powerful
modernists like Janaki Ramanad D. Jayakantan
are replacing the popular novelists like Kalki
and Akilan. Kambadassnand and Bharatdasan
blazed new poetry. Aruna and Karunanidhi
wrote authentic stories about the depressed
classes.
<br>
<br>
Malayalam is the most interesting language,
as it has Muslim, Christian and Hindu writers
in equal proportion. Poets like Vallanthol and G.
Sankara Kurup were replaced by a younger
generation of significant non-conformist writers.
Fiction writers like Joseph Mundasseri,
Muhammad Basheer, P Keshavadev and T.S.
Pillai have made their mark. Most of the novels
and short stories are still lingering around social
documentation, romantic realism and protest.
Literature in Marathi language is full of
“storm and stress”, revolutionary tendencies
being the uppermost. The greatest follower of
Gandhi, Vinodba Bhave, is from Maharashtra,
so also are leaders like Tilak and Savarkar who
advocated Hindu revival, and leftists and
socialists like Dange, Gorey and Joshi. In
literature too there is a constant debate on
modernism.
<br>
<br>
Gujarati is the language of business people
and its literature has been influenced to a great
extent by Gandhi’s non-violence. Much work
has been done in research in folklore and folkdrama. It can boast of poets like Umashankar
Joshi, “Sundaram” and Rajendra Shah, and
novelists like Pannalal Patel, “Darshak”,
Chunnilal Madia who have artistically
articulated the conditions of rural Gujarat.
In Hindi there has been the largest number
of translation from other Indian languages.
There are poets of great stature like Nirala,
Agyeya, Muktibodh; there are many other
popular and pleasant lyricists like Mahdevi,
Pant, Bachchan. Nationalist poetry has a special
impact on Hindi and Maithilisharan Gupta,
Makhanlal Chturvedi, Naveen, Dinkar and many
others wrote poems which, though didactic,
were so widely appreciated. In fiction from
Premchand to Renu, there has been an emphasis
on rural documentation, but metropolitian
pressures are also very much in view, particularly
in the short stories of Mohan Rakesh, Rajendra
Yadav, Kamleshwar and Rajkamal Chaudhari.
Punjabi has great zest for life. Poets like Vir
Singh, Mohan Singh, Amrita Pritam have made
a remarkable contribution; so also the novels of
Nanak Singh, Kanwal and the short stories of
Duggal, Satindra Singh and Ajit Kaur. This
language is the nearest solution to the meeting
of tradition and modernity. Poets like Mehjur,
Dinanath Nadim and Rahi and prose writers
like Akhatar Mohiuddin and Lone are the more
well-known modern writers.
<br>
<br>
Indian writing in English has been
acknowledged abroad with the novels of R.K.
Narayan, Raja Rao, Desani, Dr Mulk Raj Anand,
Khushwant Singh, Bhabani Bhattacharya and
Malgaonkar. Poets like Nissim Ezekiel, P. Lal,
Ramanujan and Kamla Das are published in the
English speaking countries and appreciated. In
late twentieth century writers like Vikram Seth,
Amitabh Chaudhary and Anita Desai, and
others left their mark on international audience.
In recent times many Indian authors have
left their mark on international arena. Kiran
desai, Aravind Adiga, Arundhati roy have
received coveted Man Booker prize. Apart from
them writers of Indian origin like Salman
Rushdie, Jhumpa Lahiri and Amitav Ghosh are
well respected names in English literature.
In 1930s emerged the first major figures in
the field of English literature in the shape of the
“Big Three” of Indian fiction: Mulk Raj Anand,
Raja Rao and R.K. Narayan. Mulk Raj Anand
is the most Westernized of the trio; Rao, while
writing in English and using the genre of the
novels has its roots in Sanskrit culture; Narayan’s
work occupies a middle ground between the
approaches of his two illustrious contemporaries.
<br>
<br>
Anand’s reputation was first established by
his first two novels, Untouchable (1935), which
gives an account of “a day in life” of a sweeper,
and Coolie (1936), which follows the fortunes of a
peasant boy uprooted from the land. His trilogyThe Village (1939), Across The Black Waters (1940)
and The Sword and the Sickle (1942)- is an epic
account of the gradual growth of the protagonist’s
revolutionary consciousness which may be seen as
a microcosm of India’s movement toward an
awareness of the need for independence.
Raja Rao’s first novel Kanthapura (1938) is
most straightforward. It gives an account of
how her village’s revolt against a domineering
plantation owner comes to be informed by the
Gandhian ideal of nonviolence. Rao’s major
work ‘The Serpent and the Rope’ (1960) is
regarded by some Indian critics as the most
important Indian novel in English to have
appeared to date. Rao has also published the
short novels ‘The Cat and Shakespeare’ (1965)
and ‘Comrade Kirillov’ (1976).
Narayan’s early novels include the trilogy
‘Swami and Friends’ (1935), ‘The Bachelor of
Arts’ (1937) and ‘The English Teacher’ (1945).
The novels of his middle period represent his
best work. These include ‘Mr. Sampath’ (1949),
‘The Financial Expert’ (1952), ‘The Guide’ (1958),
‘The Man-Eater of Malgudi’ (1961) and ‘The
Sweet-Vendor’ (1967). They explore conflicts
between traditional Hindu values and Western
incursions into the society. Narayan’s more
recent novels include The Painter of Signs (1976),
A Tiger for Malgudi (1983) and Talkative Man
(1986). He has also published several volumes
of short stories, including An Astrologer’s Day
(1947) and Lawley Read (1956).
<br>
<br>
Nirad Chaudhari is the most Controversial
of Indian writers in English. He emerged on the
scene with his book The Autobiography of an
Unknown Indian (1951). When he visited
England, he recorded his experiences in ‘A
Passage to England’ (1959). In ‘The Continent
of Circe’ (1965), he puts forward the thesis that
the Aryan settlers of India became enfeebled by
the climate of North India. He has also published
To Live or not to Live (1970) and a second
volume of autobiography ‘Thy Hand, Great
Anarch’ (1987).
Anita Desai has written ‘Fire in the
Mountains’ (1977), ‘Clear Light of Day’ (1980)
and ‘The Village by the Sea’ (1982), ‘Cry the
Peack’ (1963), ‘Bye-Bye Black Bird’ (1971) and
‘In Custody’ (1984). Her subtle prose and
sensitive evocation of the inner lives of her
characters makes her one of the finest talents at
work in the Indian novel.
<br>
<br>
Salman Rushdie won the 1981 Booker
Prize for Midnight’s Children (1981). He has
also published Grimus (1975), a science fiction,
Shame (1983) and The Jaguar Smile (1987), a
journal about war-torn Nicaragua and of course,
the banned book-Satanic Verses. He was also
awarded the Booker of Booker for Midnight
Children.
Vikram Seth’s first novel, ‘A Suitable Boy’
has made him the most hyped-up first–time
novelist in the history of Indian literature. ‘The
Golden Gate’, a novel in verse had hit the
bestseller’s lists in 1986-87. ‘The Golden Gate’
was followed by three collection of verse: The
Humble Administrator’s Garden, ‘All you Who
Sleep Tonight’ and ‘Beastly Tales from Here’
and There.

The Period around Independence provided
Khushwant Singh and Manohar Malgaonkar
with the subject matter of their best novels:
Singh’s ‘A Train to Pakistan’ (1956) and
Malgaonkar’s ‘A Bend in the Ganges’ (1964)
deal with partition; Singh’s ‘I Shall Not Hear the
Nightingale’ (1959) is about the movements of
a Sikh family in the Punjab in the uncertain
period before partition and Malgonkar’s ‘The
Princes’ (1963) a sympathetic account of the
tragedy of a family in the Punjab in the uncertain
period before partition and Malgonkar’s The
Princes (1963) a sympathetic account of the

that ruled many ‘native’ states during the Raj.
Kamla Markandya’s novels, which include
‘Nectar in a Sieve’ (1954), ‘A Handful of Rice’
(1966) and the ‘Coffer Dams’ (1969), are mainly

Writer Prize.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indian Poetry in English</i></strong></div>

While Indian poetry in English dates back
to the early nineteenth century, it is really only
in the period since independence that it has
come of age. Kamala Das Writes about women’s
emotions with a candor unprecedented in Indian
verse and Arum Kootchar, winner of the 1977
Commonwealth Poetry Prize for his collection
Japura, in which the eponymous village provides
a reference point for meditations on Indian life,
ancient and modern. Other notable poets after
independence writing in English include Adil
Jussawalla, P. Lala, Jayanta Mahapatra, Dom
Moraes, Rajagopal Parthasarathy, Gieve Patel and A.K. Ramanujan.
