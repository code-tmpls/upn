<h3>Indian Paintings</h3>

The origin of Indian painting goes back to
8000 years and an account of its development
is inextricably meshed with the development of
Indian civilization. Hunters and gatherers who
made primitive tools and lived in the rock
shelters of central India, made exaggerated
linear figures of wild animals, such as the bison,
the elephant and the stag in red and yellow
ochre on the rock surfaces of cave walls. The
tradition of painting on the walls of caves went
through at least ten distinct phases. But the
culmination of Indian frescoes can be seen at
Ajanta, where from the time of the Sungas in
the second century B.C., wall painting continued
to be made until the fifth century.
There is no definite evidence from the Indus
valley Civilization of any painting activity, except
the decorations which occur on earthen pots.
Geometric, floral and faunal designs in black on
red terracotta pots seem to indicate that the art
of painting was not entirely unknown.
The Indus Valley civilization came to an
end around 1500 BC when the cities in which
it had flowered declined and were replaced by
small anonymous chalcolithic villages. There is
very little information about the next 1000 years
and there is no evidence of any painting dating
to the Mauryan period. If there were paintings,
it is possible that they were made on fragile
materials and did not survive the passing of
over 2000 years.
<br>
<br>
Indian painting reached a high level of
achievement around Gupta period of Ajanta
and at Bagh in central India, where entire
settlements of rock-cut caves were decorated
with figures of men and women. Some for them,
like the famous painting of the Bodhisattva, are
graceful and yet pensive, as of pondering the
cycle of birth and death. Others portray
sumptuous court scenes in which foreign
diplomats in unfamiliar garments are being
received with their retinues at royal courts. The
Ajanta style has been described as poetic
dynamism set in motion, and these paintings
are indeed cynically lovely and universally
charming.
<br>
<br>
When the Gupta Empire declined and
shrank, its style of art underwent several distinct
changes which art historians have classified
into three phases. In the 7th to 8th century,
which constitutes the first phase, the styles did
not change very visibly. Painting activity seems
to have shifted at this time from Ajanta caves
to the neighboring caves at Ellora. In the Hindu
rock–cut Kailash caves, artists painted scenes
from the Hindu epic, the Ramayana.
Further south, in the southern state of Tamil
Nadu, the 7th century Kailashnath temple has
paintings in a bold style with stylized facial
features. During the second phase, from the 9th
to the 12th century, we find new sensibilities.
The paintings of murals in south depict both
stories from the epics and secular representations
of king Rajaraja the Great, with his queens.
The third phase, which dates to the 13th to
16th centuries, is considered a period of slow
decadence, since creativity in art was replaced
by excellence of craftsmanship. It was during
this period that the earliest book illustrations
developed. Buddhist scriptures such as the
Pranjaparamita preserved on palm-leaf
manuscripts were now illustrated for the first
time with miniatures in flat, bright houses of red
and blue, outlined in black. The pala rulers of
eastern India, who came to power in the 9th
century, encouraged this form of art, and so did
royal patrons in other parts of India.
Another school of miniature painting is
known as Apbrahmsa School which flourished
in western India, particularly in Gujarat. In the
earlier phase palm-leaf manuscripts were used
but in the later phase paper was introduced.
<br>
<br>
Jain manuscripts were illustrated in a slightly
larger format. When paper was subsequently
introduced, the manuscripts continued to be
horizontal in shape retaining the format of the
original palm leaf manuscripts. The themes
were derived from Jain sacred texts, but also
touched Vaishnava subjects depicting love such
as Git Govinda.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chola Series</i></strong></div>

The magnificent Chola series of paintings in
the Brihadesvara temple illustrate the fight of
Shiva with the Tipuras, the almost invincible
demons, the story of Sundaramurti, the celestial
dancers, Shiva watching the dance, Rajaraja and
his spiritual guru, all masterpieces of 1000 AD.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hoysala Paintings</i></strong></div>

This painting is represented by a rare
collection of illustrated palm leaf manuscripts.
They are indeed so delicate and charming and
so colourful that they form a class of their own.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vijayanagara Painting</i></strong></div>

Vijayanagara painting is illustrated by a
magnificent series at Hampi of the 15th century
AD wherein the spiritual preceptor Vidyaranaya
is shown moving in a palanquin in a procession.
There are other scenes from the Puranas like
Bhikshatana and Mohini effectively portrayed
here as well as at Chidambaram. In the
Virupaksha Temple, there is Tripurantaka
Madanataka, the marriage of Arjuna and other
themes effectively painted.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chera Paintings</i></strong></div>

In Kerala, the Chera paintings from
Tirunandikkarai constitute an important
landmark though it is the late ones of the 17th18th centuries from Mathancheri palace,
Padmanabhapuram palace, the temples like
Tiruvanjikulam, Ettumanur and other that give
effective and adequate examples showing a
colourful galaxy of over decorated form
developed from the norm of the late Chalukyas
and Hysalas.
<br>
<br>
It was not until the second half of the 16th
century that a truly creative style of miniature
painting developed in India, and this was the
result of fusion between India and Persian
styles. The new style developed in the court of
Akbar, who successfully blended Hindu and
Islamic elements to create the style that we now
call Mughal, in architecture, art and
administration. Akbar established workshops
or Karkhanas for painters at his court at
Fatehpuri Sikri, near Agra. Under the guidance
of a Persian artist named Mir Sayyid Ali, and
a talented calligrapher named Abdus Salam,
about a hundred promising young artists of all
castes and creeds were trained in the art of
miniature paining and in the equally important
art calligraphy. Some of them became renowned
artists and their names reflected their varied
origins, and the fact that they included both
Hindus and Muslims. Mansur, for example was
Muslim; Govardhan, Basawan and Daswarth
were Hindus. They had one thing in common.
They excelled and developed under the
Emperor’s unbiased patronage, and produced
some of the finest miniature paintings that have
ever been made.
<br>
<br>
Mughal miniatures defy traditional western
classification. They are not always on paper.
Not all of them are of a standard size. In fact
some of them are far from miniature in size,
being as large as English watercolours. And, not
all of them were made as illustrations for books.
Some are individual paintings gathered in albums
called Muraqqa. Despite the variation, however,
they comprise a distinct recognizable style in
terms of treatment and the materials used.
Akbar’s religious tolerance is well known. He
was particularly interested in religion and in the
study of religious scriptures. Among the
manuscripts written and illustrated under his
direction were the Baburnama and the
Akbarnama. Both these were done on paper
and illustrated with a large number of beautiful
paintings. Artists in Akbar’s reign used ochre,
kaolin, terra verde, carbon black, malachite and
azurite, and later lead white, madder lake,
indigo and peori, yellow substance extracted
from the urine of cows fed on mango leaves.
They also used gold, silver and lapis lazuli, the
latter imported from Afghanistan. Every bit of
the paintings is finely worked and entire scenes
of battle and court life come alive in fascinating
details. Artists used delicate brushes made of
squirrel’s hair to achieve these effects.
<br>
<br>
The paintings done in Akbar’s time
established new patterns of art. The Persian
influence was marked, and yet the court artists
were able to convey something of the
environment in which the paintings were made.
If Akbar established a new idiom in the field
of painting, his son, Jahangir brought it to its
paramount, for the miniatures produced under
his patronage are the best of those in the
Mughal style. Although he was not as great a
ruler as his father, Jahangir had an interest in
fauna and flora that led to a large number of
lovely paintings of animals, birds and plants
being done.
<br>
<br>
The illustrations of important manuscripts
continued during Jahangir’s reign, but he also
put in train a large number of individual
paintings. These portraits of all kinds of people,
and paintings of single birds and animals, are
distinctly different from the crowded scenes
that substrate the senses of Akbar’s reign.
Jahangir’s paintings are also characterized by
fine brushwork and shading. Optical perspective
was meticulously maintained, and the landscape
was integrated with the best of the compositions.
After Jahangir’s reign, Mughal painting
declined in quality and originality. Jahangir’s
son and successor, Shahjahan’s, the builder of
the Taj Mahal, was more interested in
architecture than painting. Under his rule,
Mughal architecture reached a pinnacle of
excellence, but painting suffered from lack of
royal interest. And, when Shahjahan’s
puritanical son Aurangzeb became Emperor in
the second half of 17th century, Mughal painting,
more or less, came to an end, although craftsmen
continued to produce works of art for
diminishing market.
<br>
<br>
Many of the artists trained in the Mughal
Karkhanas and their apprentices flocked to the
courts of smaller Hindu states in Rajasthan, in
place such as Bundi, Kotah, Jaipur, Jodhpur
and Bikaner, and to the northern hill states of the
Punjab, such as Kangra, Kulu, Nurpur, Chamba,
Basohli and Guler. The rulers of Rajasthani states
had always encouraged painting, even in the
heyday of Mughal art and now they became the
major patrons of this form of art. The painting
produced in these states drew upon the local
artistic and religious traditions as well as those
established by the Mughal School. Literary works
such as Gita Govinda, which tells of passionate
love between the god Krishna and Radha, and
other works such as the Bhagawata Purana and
Rasikpriya all provided themes that were rich in
imagery and symbolism.
The artists of the Rajasthani schools did not
attempt to follow the rules of perspective.
Instead, they relied on hands of colour to create
a feeling of depth. They did not employ the
Mughal techniques of highlighting certain
sections of the painting. Light is distributed
uniformly over the entire scheme.
Rajput painting is the painting of Rajputana
and Bundelkhand, and the Punjab Himalayas.
The known examples reigning from the later
part of the sixteenth into the nineteenth century
fall into two main groups, Rajasthani (Rajputana
and Bundelkhand), and Pahari. Latter group is
again divisible into Jammu School, with reference
to all the hill states west of the Satluj, and
Kangra School, with reference to all the hill
states of the Jalandhar group, east of the same
river. Sikh painting, mainly done in Lahore and
Amritsar in the time of Ranjit Singh, is an
immediate derivative of Kangra School.
<br>
<br>
One of the oldest Rajput paintings has probably
the Krishna Lila theme, which, in style, lyrical
theme and the presentation, and in the language
of superscription shows a relation to the Gujarati
painting of the fifteenth century. Most typical are
the several series of Ragmala pictures dated in the
later part of the sixteenth century. These represent
the purest Rajput style in its most vigorous form.
Their most obvious features are the great vitality
of the drawing and colour.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rajasthani School of Painting</i></strong></div>

The Rajasthani school of painting developed
around the same time as the Mughal school, as
a direct natural evolution from the western
Indian style. Till the 17th century, they remained
unaffected by the mughal style. The subject
matter was essentially Hindu. The main theme
was Raagmla or garland of songs. They depict
ragas and raginis in their emotive setting. Besides,
Radha-Krishna myth, Purana, Ramayan,
Mahabharata, Barahmasa, Nayika bheda etc.
also form major themes. The main regional
schools or styles were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Kishangarh School:</b> Kishangarh, near
Jaipur is an important centre of the vallabh sect.
The school achieved its peak during the reign of
Raja Sawant Singh (1748-68), who was also
called Kavi Nagari Das. The main theme of
painting of this school and his painting ‘Bani
Thani’ has been called ‘Indian Monalisa’. He
developed the mannerist style. The paintings of
this school are lyrical and sensuous. The females
in the painting have slender curves, almond
eyes and lyrical fingers. They reflect the amorous
sentiment or Sringara Rasa. Nature is depicted
in green colour. Other noted painters of this
school were Surdhwaj, Amir Chand, Dhanna,
etc.</li>
        <li><b>Jaipur School:</b> It developed in the 16th
century. During Aurangzeb’s period, there was
a flight of painters from his court as the latter
discouraged painting. Hence the painters flocked
to Jaipur. This is why this school has mughal
influence. The school achieved its peak during
Raja Jai Singh. Its prominent feature was the
use of lead in painting. The themes of painting
included Raag Ragini, Barahmasa, Durgapath,
war scenes, Radha Krishna, birds and animals
etc. The prominent painters of this school were
Sahib Ram, Mohammad Sur, Chitra, Gopal,
Jeevan etc. The Jaipur style murals were called
‘Arayash’.</li>
        <li><b>Marwar School:</b> Jodhpur was the
principal seat of this school which developed
pictorial art on its own lines. The themes of
painting included raagmala, Barahmasa, Dhola
maru, folk deities like pabuji, Dungji, portraits
etc. Equestrian Portraits of royal household and
nobility, folk dances, family sense were also
made. The males in the paintings had broad
eyes, beard, moustache, head gear, sword and
shield. The females had rounded hair, lotus
eyes, long arms and supported bindi, Mehendi,
bangles etc. The animals depicted were camel,
horse and dogs. The prominent painters of this
school were Shivdas Bhatti, Kishandas Bhatti,
Devadas Bhatti etc.</li>
        <li><b>Bundi School:</b> This school was famous
for painting of animals and the use of black and
blue colour. The important paintings of animals
and birds include- elephants under black clouds,
line of cranes, chetak, mayor etc. Besides animals
and birds, the other themes were Raag Ragini,
inking water. Season also formed an important
theme. The males in the paintings sported
bundled head gear, dupatta, pyjama and had
a healthy face and round forehead. The noted
painters of this school were Surjan, Ahmad Ali,
Shri Krishna and Ram Lal.</li>
        <li><b>Bikaner School:</b> This school of painting
developed fully by 1680. It was influenced by
the Mughal and Kangra Schools. The themes of
painting included Raagmala, Barahmasa, Geeta,
Krishna Lila etc. Its distinctive feature was usta
kala perfected by Hamiduddin usta. It was
painting done on camel hide, ivory, stones etc.
Ruknuddin was the foremost painter of this
school.</li>
        <li><b>Mewar School:</b> It was a mixture of Jain
and Gujarati style. It was patronized by rulers
like Amar Singh, Sangram Singh and Bhim
Singh. It attained highest development during
the rule of Jagat Singh. The themes of this school
of painting included Krishna Lila, Padmavalis
of Surdas, Ramayan etc. Its prominent feature
was the use of red and blue colour. The foremost
painters of this school were Nitharuddin,
Manohar and Sahibuddin.</li>
