<h3>Media</h3>

The Post-Independence India has witnessed
an explosion in the field of mass media like
newspapers, magazines, books, radio, TV and
films. After the British left India the Indian
media could be used to serve the interests of the
people and the nation, according to the new
visions, policies, and national goals set by the
new architects of the nation, the media owners,
and the experts. Communication network was
strengthened to preserve the Unity and integrity
of Indian and secure the active cooperation of
people in the era of planned development and
reconstruction.

India is the second largest publisher in
newspaper producing more than 20,758
newspapers with a circulation of about 55.4
millions. Of these 1,423 are dailies, 6,123 weeklies
and 13,105 periodicals besides bi-weeklies and
tri-weeklies. India is the largest book producer
in the Third World and ranks among the first
ten in the whole world. It is also the third largest
producer of books in English. However titles on
Natural Sciences, Medical Sciences and
Technology trail behind.
<br>
<br>
India has four news agencies– Press Trust
of India (PTI), United News of India (UNI),
Samachar Bharati and Hindustan Samachar.
PTI was set up on August 27, 1947. It took over
from the Associated Press of India (API) and
Reuters. It has around 124 news bureau in the
country. UNI was registered as a company in
1854 and started news operation in 1961. In
1982 it launched its Hindi news services
‘Univarta’. It operates a news service to the
media in four Gulf countries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Television</i></strong></div>

At 6 P.M. on September 15, 1959, Pratima
Puri read out the programmes, the first telecast
in India. In the beginning, the TV programmes
were telecast only twice a week for only one
hour. From 1959 till 1966 the TV programmes
were telecast live but in 1966 for the first time
a programme was recorded on astronaut Yuri
Gagarin. A film processing plant was also
installed. Meanwhile the telecast of the feature
film started but each film was shown in two
parts on two consecutive Sundays. Gradually
transmission was extended to four days.
In 1966 a play was shown every week. G.D.
Shukul’s play Aisa Bhi Hota Ha was telecast in
106 episodes and was very popular with the
viewers. Also 10 episodes of Sara Akash were
telecast, in which Kulbhushan Kharbanda
played a key role.
<br>
<br>
In 1971 along with the “School of
Television”, a programme on news and current
affairs was started, like News Perspective Weekly
in English and Desh Videsh and Aamne Saamne
in Hindi. A programme for the common man
was also introduced in which the then Prime
Minister late Mrs. Indira Gandhi was invited.
Many people of different sections of society
attended the live programme as this was the
first time that the Prime Minister was having a
word with the people on T.V. In the year 1972,
apart from Delhi, centres were opened in
Amritsar, Srinagar and Bombay and the
transmission time increased to three and half
hours.
<br>
<br>
In 1975, eminent scientist Vikram Sarabhai
mooted the idea of educating and entertaining
people with the help of ‘satellite’. Soon
transmissions to this effect began through
A.T.S.F. 6 at NASA. In 1973, a production
centre was set up at Vigyan Bhawan. After that
similar centres were opened at Calcutta, Madras
and Lucknow.

The development of television was gradual
until the microwave technique came. With it the
INSAT-1A was availed and in July 1982, the
national programme on TV started. In the
beginning the duration of the national
programme was one and a half hour every day.
On August 15, 1982 New Delhi, Jalandhar,
Srinagar, Lucknow, Calcutta, Madras and
Bombay were linked to the microwave. At first
the national network programmes were telecast
from 8.30 to 10.30 which were changed from 9
to 10.45. But from August 11, 1985 the national
programmes were held from 8.40 P.M. All
Kendras telecast the Hindi news bulletin but on
a request from the Government of Tamil Nadu,
the Madras centre stopped this bulletin.
The idea of national telecast was mooted at
the time of Asian Games in November 1982. Shiv
Shankar Sharma, then a Kendra Director, was
brought to Delhi from Calcutta and was given
the responsibility for the telecast of the Asian
Games. The Government was a little apprehensive
about the success of the venture and the plans
were afoot to give the responsibility to BBC. But
Doordarshan decided to shoulder the
responsibility alone. All the people in Doordarshan
worked as a team covering 22 sports disciplines
taking place at 18 different stadia in the three
metros. The telecast received kudos from all
centres of the world. This telecast ushered in a
new chapter in the history of Doordarshan. The
coverage of CHOGM and NAM were the other
feathers in Doordarshan’s cap.
<br>
<br>
In 1984 with the serial Humlog began the era
of sponsored soap operas. In 1984-85,
Doordarshan’s earnings through its commercial
service were 31.44 crore which went up in the
following 1985-87, 136.30 crore in 1987-88, 161.31
crore in 1988-89 and 210 crore in 1989-90.
On December 20, 1989 even the swearing in
ceremony of the new Cabinet of Ministers and the
President’s address to the joint session of Parliament
was brought live. The year 1989 is also significant
because the information and news were include
directly (live in the national bulletins during the
general elections on November.
<br>
<br>
In February 1989 the Central Production
Centre at Delhi came into operation. In 1991 the
winter session of Parliament was recorded and
aired after some cuts. It was not put live due to
some technical reasons.
Today, there are heaps of proposals for
sponsored programmes and serials with a
number of committees and sub-committees to
take decisions. Serials on Ramayana,
Mahabharata, Vishwamitra, Bahadurshah
Zafar, Tipu Sultan and Chankya have been
telecast.
Today there are more than 550 transmitters
operating in the country. TV course 82 per cent
of population and 67.6 per cent of the area. The
first indigenous Black and White TV receiver
was produced in India in 1969. The number has
gone up to 45.6 million by 1992.
Radio
Though T.V. has made inroads into radio’s
audience, this audio media is still very popular
with the people, particularly among lower and
middle class income group. Radio is less costly
and easy to handle and care. Channels are more
in Radio than in T.V. And one can do one’s usual
work with radio playing in the background. In
villages, people still rely more on B.B.C than on
T.V. news. Besides, most of the villages in India
have no electricity. Thus, TV can be watched
only with the help of battery and that is a costly
affairs. So, Radio is still the most convenient
entertainment as well as news medium.
In 1927, Bombay and Calcutta witnessed
the installation of two privately owned
transmitters. But in real sense the revolution
started with the establishment of the Indian
Broadcasting Service when the above two
transmitters were taken over by the Government
of India. The name Indian Broadcasting Service
was changed to All India Radio (AIR) in 1936,
which was again changed to Akashvani in
1957. Besides Akashvani Delhi, every state capital
has its own radio station. Gradually, important
district towns were gifted with a regional radio
centre of their own.
<br>
<br>
In the initial days, the programmes were
information oriented. Music relayed was often,
classical Debates and discussion on current
socio-economic and political scenario could be
heard quite often on radio. The only interest of
common people it could cater to was through
relaying live commentary of cricket and hockey
matches. Otherwise, the programmes were
stereo-typed. One could listen to Hindi songs on
Radio Sri Lanka, thus attracting Indian sponsors.
The programmes recorded in India, particularly
in Bombay, were sent to Sri Lanka. Binaca
Geetmala, a package of Hindi songs from latest
films broadcast from 8 P.M. on Wednesday was
an instant hit. People waited breathlessly to
hear the rank of their favorite songs. The rank
was decided by the sale of the cassettes and the
requests from the Radio Shrota Sangha.
<br>
<br>
For News, people, even in the remotest
villages, listened to BBC Hindi Service. They
relied heavily on its news about India. On May
18, 1988, a National Radio Channel was born.
The transmission originated in Delhi and then
beamed all over the country through a 1000 kW
transmitter at Nagpur. National Channel started
at 11 P.M. and continued till early morning.
The programmes included Hindi songs, English
songs, classical music and even regional songs.
The Vividh Bhrati Service, an exclusive
entertainment channel was the only respite for
the common people. But it lacked the range of
Radio Sri lanka Broadcasting and songs played
were always oldies. Technically speaking, two
high power short wave transmitters in Madras
and Bombay carried the transmissions. There
were 32 Commercial Broadcasting centers.
Of late, the programmes on Vividh Bharati
have gained in both, range and quality. Radio
Srilanka has lost its place to indigenous, more
clear, Vividh Bharati. From forgotten melodies
to the latest pop can be heard on this channel.
Sponsored programmes have been bringing in
revenue too. Film previews can also be heard.
Hawa Mahal is popular for the humorous
dramas. Chhaya Geet, heard at 10 P.M. every
night, is a package of Hindi songs based on a
particular them. At 10.45 P.M. this channel
closes its transmission.
<br>
<br>
Yuvavani is for the youth. Mehfil (Hindi
songs) and Play it Cool (English songs) are very
popular among students. A student is invited to
play the records of his/her choice for the
audience in case of above programmes. Youth
based topics are also discussed on Yuvavani.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Satellite Invasion</i></strong></div>

Towards the end of 1991 STAR TV, then a
little known Hong Kong company acquired a
transponder and began beaming spectrum of
shows to the Indian subcontinent. Ted Turner’s
Cable News Network (CNN) International has
already provided Indians with the first taste of
the dazzling satellite technology.
Then surfaced on the scene, the illegal, but
enterprising cable TV operators. This helped
STAR to invade Indian homes with vengeance.
The responses to STARS TV in India has been
staggering; from 4.12 lakh urban households in
January, the number has zoomed to 12.82 lakh,
an increase of 211 per cent. At present STAR is
relaying on five channels viz, Star Plus, MTV,
Prime Sports, BBC and Zee TV.
<br>
<br>
But, STAR’s audience in Indian is only a
fraction of Doordarshan’s total reach a staggering
125 million people in urban settlements, plus a
possible 75 million more in the countryside.
Doordarshan’s national network and seven
regional networks are serviced by scores of ground
based transmitters linked to two INSAT satellites.
More regional networks are planned in the next
few years. But Doordarshn’s greatest indictment
comes from STAR’S success. Viewers have to pay
cable operators for the satellite channels and
most of the programmes are unrelated to their
lives yet STAR is spreading into city slums and
into the countryside.
To counter STAR’s success, Mandi House
started Metro Channel loaded with programmes
related to films. Though this channel’s popularity
has increased tremendously, some say D.D. has
become a poor man’s version of the Hindi
cinema. Films, variations of Chitrahaar and
interviews with film stars have become the
order of the day.
<br>
<br>
DD, till recently, was also placed at
disadvantage because it was transmitting only
terrestrially, and viewers had to disconnect the
cable- TV Line to switch on Doordarshan. As
such DD’s latest move of transmitting its Metro
Channel via INSAT seems to be the first serious
step on the part of the government to fight the
competition from STAR et al. For transmission
of Metro Channel, DD is using INSAT 1D and
INSAT -2A transponders. The TV signals from
these transponders can be received only through
dish antennae, which are so highly priced as to
be unaffordable to the common viewer.
