<h3>Indian Cinema</h3>

Before Independence, film making was
essentially a middle class pursuit geared towards
providing alternative entertainment of theatre.
The emotional aspirations of wide majority of
masses were well-reflected in many mythological
costumes dramas, social comedies, musicals and
crime thrillers churned out by the “dream
factories” of Bombay, Calcutta and Madras.
Patriotic films like Bhuli Nai (Bengali), Veer
Pandya Kattabomman (Tamil), Pehla Admi
(Hindi) etc. were manifestations of a cultural
upsurge inspired by the struggle against a foreign
ruler.
<br>
<br>
When the British left India, cinema acquired
a different class Character. The petty bourgeoisie
emerged as the key manipulators with sundry
traders, money lenders, smugglers and the
nouveau riche semiliterate taking over from the
middle class. Together, they addressed themselves
to a fast expanding working class who became
the basic audience for this mode of entertainment.
The tradition was complete by the early
1950s. Mehboob, Bimal Roy and Guru Dutt rose
up as invincible Titans of the celluloid world,
guiding the passion of millions. While all their
films –beginning with Andaaz, Do Bighaa Zamin
and Udayer Pathey, onwards to Pyaasa and
Mother India –reflect varying degrees of social
concern, each one also served as star vehicles for
lesser mortals like Balraj Sahni, K.L Saigal, Dilip
Kumar, Raj Kapoor, Meena Kumari and Nargis.
Raj Kapoor left his mark on Indian cinema with
a blend of art and showmanship as not only
were his films relevant but commercially
successful also. His films became international
success also especially in the USSR, Central Asia
and Eastern Europe.
<br>
<br>
Popular cinema also generated certain myths
in terms of plot structures, creation of archetypes,
introduction of music and dance, sensuality and
violence… all measured to conform to a welltried box office formula. From a medium of
artistic expression, cinema turned into a cutthroat competitive business by the end of sixties.
For those who believed in the
democratization of cinema, this evoked peculiar
responses. Ritwik Ghatak trusted more on his
wide angle lenses, avoided close-ups and
demolished the archetypal screen hero. The
mid-fifties also saw Satyajit Ray and others
experimenting with a brand of “neo-realism”
that sought to raise the collective intelligence of
audiences. Together with Ritwik Ghatak and
Mrinal Sen he was responsible for introducing
a “parallel cinema” with it peculiar angularities
and a distinct set of codes and myths. Moreover,
with the Brechtian format they brought cinema
so close to theatre, that Ray had to concede in
1980 “My aim is to release cinema from
theatricality”.
<br>
<br>
Satyajit Ray: He is regarded as one of the
greatest auteur of 20th century cinema. Ray’s
first film, Pather Panchali (1955), won eleven
international prizes, including Best Human
Document at the Cannes film festival. Numerous
awards were bestowed on Ray throughout his
lifetime, including 32 National Film Awards by
the Government of India, in addition to awards
at international film festivals. At the Berlin Film
Festival, he was one of only three filmmakers to
win the Silver Bear for Best Director more than
once and holds the record for the most number
of Golden Bear nominations, with seven. At the
Venice Film Festival, where he had previously
won a Golden Lion for Aparajito (1956), he was
awarded the Golden Lion Honorary Award in
1982. That same year, he received an honorary
“Hommage à Satyajit Ray” award at the 1982
Cannes Film Festival.
<br>
<br>
Ray is the second film personality after
Chaplin to have been awarded honorary
doctorates by Oxford University. He was
awarded the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1985
and the Legion of Honor by the President of
France in 1987. The Government of India
awarded him the highest civilian honour, Bharat
Ratna shortly before his death. The Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Ray
an honorary Oscar in 1992 for Lifetime
Achievement.
<br>
<br>
Neo realism: World cinema was particularly
influenced by neo realistic cinema of Italy which
was a response to Second World War and
resultant frustration among artists due to
violence and large destruction of not only
physical damage and casualties but also of
human values. It was particularly influenced by
existential philosophy and it later resulted in to
development of what is popularly known as
“parallel cinema” today. Few great auteurs of
world cinema then were Vittorio De Sica,
Federico Fellini, Rossellini, Akira Kurosawa,
Jean Renoir and Ingmar Bergmann.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indigenous Productions</i></strong></div>

V. Shantaram sprang a surprise with Jhanak
Jhank Payal Baaje- the first colour film made
wholly by an Indian crew. This was followed by
Mohan Segal’s Adhikaar, Raj Kappor’s Shree
420, Guru Dutt’s Mr. And Mrs. Bimal and
Devendra Goel’s Vachan, Bimal Roy’s Naukri
and Satyen Bose’s Bandish. Bimal Roy also
produced a documentary (for Films Division)
Gautama the Buddha, which won a top national
award as well as a special mention at Cannes.
During this period Hrishikesh Mukherjee
used cinema as medium to portray common
man and middle class ethos in his films which
totally deglamourized the hero and presented
him as person next door. He also rejuvenated
and redefined comedy as he used his protagonist
instead of mimes (professional comedians) to
create humour out of everyday situations.
Meanwhile, Mrinal Sen emerged of the
scene with Raat Bhor (1956). Progressing
gradually from the dull mediocrity of Punascha
(1961), the half-baked comedy of Abasheshe
(1962) and a French-inspired Akash Kusum
(1965) to the sudden brilliance of Matira Manisha
(1967) sustained by Ek Adhuri Kahani (1971)
and the masterpiece of Oka Oorie Katha (1977)
immediately followed by the wild improvisations
of Parashuram (1978), he finally straightened
out in Ek Din Prati Din (1983) and then Genesis
(1986).
<br>
<br>
In retrospect, Sen’s Bhuvan Shome (1969)
can well be regarded as the turning point of
Indian cinema, when the “new wave” first hit
the shores. The film made on an unsecured loan
granted by the then film finance corporation,
became a trend setter, inspiring the likes of
Shyam Benegal (Ankur), P. Reddy (Samskara),
Girish Karnad (Kaddu), B.V. Karanth (Godhuli),
Adoor Gopalakrishnan (Swayamvaram), M.S.
Sathyu (Garma Hawa), Awtar Kaul (27 Down),
G.V. lyer (Hamsa Geethe), G. Aravindan
(Uttarayanam) and many others.
Of them Shyam Benegal has proved to be
the most prolific with an impressive track record
of 15 full-length features and 38 documentaries
made in less than twelve years. Like his
contemporaries, he began on an angry note
questioning the fundamentals of feudal
relationships (Nishant, Aarohan, Susman), only
to step back in time as a silent observer of history
(Junoon/Nehru/Trikaal). He reached his apogee
in 1977 with Bhumika a momentous
biographical on a Marathi stage artist which
won lead actress Smita Patil her first National
Award.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Role of NFDC</i></strong></div>

The National Film Development Corporation
(NFDC) was established in 1980 and the situation
brightened a bit. Theater construction activity
stepped up, loans were granted to deserving
film-makers, avenues for exports explored,
participation in foreign festivals improved and
film weeks organized all in a bid to spread the
message of good cinema around. The major
beneficiaries of the schemes were, of course, the
young enterprising film graduates from the
Films and Television Institute of India in Pune,
who would otherwise have never found an
audience for themselves.
<br>
<br>
An analysis of the NFDC films produced
would however, present a different picture.
Technically perfect, they all lacked in the
thematic spontaneity and freshness. By and
large, each film appeared a distilled version of
Ghatak, Ray or Benegal – so strong is their
influence on the present generation. Govind
Nihalani made many films including Aakrosh
(1979) and Vijeta (1982): each one on the theme
of individual vs. the establishment. Whether it
centered on the idealism of a young lawyer
obtaining justice, the predicament of an air
force cadet making a career, or the internal
conflicts of a police officer, a budding poet or
trade unionist, the presentation is the same. As
Benegal’s cameraman, his style tends to be
warped, if not repetitive. Even in casting,
Nihalani continues to bank on the same old
trusted faces, without any inclination to change.
Among Ghatak’s successors, only Kumar
Shahani (Tarang) and Nirad Mohapatra (Maya
Miriga) could display the courage to develop a
style to the level of an epic. The other MohapatraManmohan (Klanta Aparanha) – continues to
languish in faithful emulation of his master.
Ketan Mehta tried to achieve the epic form in
Holi and now Kartoos, only that the influence
of French impressionists is much stronger.
Prakash Jha (Daamul) with swinging camera
movements and long takes could successfully
suppress his deficiencies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ray’s Bandwagon</i></strong></div>

As for Ray, the most ardent followers can
be found in the South especially in Karnataka
from the makers of Samshara, Ghattasraddha,
Grahana and Phaniyamma. Rabindra
Dharamraj’s Chakra made a real effort to imitate
Ray, though the impact was lost in a diffused
presentation of slum dwelling have-nots.
Utpalendu Chakraborty was more faithful in
Moina Tadanta, Chokh and Debshishu which
showed the same flashes of anger and remorse
like Gautam Ghosh (Ma Bhoomi, Dakhal and
Paar) and Buddhadev Dasgupta (Dooratwa
and Andhi Gali). All these films have certain
innocence, a sense of awe in the presence of
unknown humanity that should flatter Ray. His
stamp is strikingly visible.
<br>
<br>
Then there are those like Kundan Shah
(Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron) and Saeed Mirza (Albert
Pinto Ko Gussa Kyon Aata Hai?) who refused
to jump into any bandwagon and progressively
evolved their own brand of wry humour – and
awesome mix of Brechtian irony and black
comedy. On a serious level, Mr. S. Sathyu’s
preoccupation with aesthetics led to the creation
of Garam Hawa and Sookha- again, refreshingly
honest and unpretentious. A glorious extension
of the form appears in G.V. lyer’s Adi
Shankaracharya – the first Indian Sanskrit film,
incidentally, wholly financed by the NFDC.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Aravindan’s ‘Poetic’ Cinema</i></strong></div>

With G. Aravindan, cinema acquired a
poetic quality- near magical product of nature.
His films seem to be made without a camera or
crew, but created directly by the laws of
cinematography. In Thampu, the palpability of
his itinerant circus performers in overwhelming;
in Pokkuveyil, he weaves a shimmering web out
of the insane interaction of sensitive mind with
the lights and colors of the earth, merging with
the softy shining bodies of characters. In
Chidambaram, nature is revealed like the word
of God. Man is seen as a projection of nature.
The other outstanding director from Kerala,
Adoor Gopala Krishnan could not be more
different. He builds tension out of a powerful
mix of idea and fact, equally sensitive to mind
and body, to noise and to silence. His growth
from the understated descriptions of his early
films of the complex orchestrations of his recent
works (Elippathayam and Mukhamukham)
makes his achievements remarkable and his
promise even greater.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contemporary Cinema</i></strong></div>

In 20th century cinema portrayed uppermiddle class ethos and consumerist attitude due
to development of multiplex culture. Similarly
expanding business in other countries led to
development of a particular genre of NRI movies.
Parallel cinema however has found
expression among new breed of prolific female
directors which include Deepa Mehta, Mira
Niar, Kalpana Lajmi, Aparna sen and others.
Similarly Anurag Kashyap, Ram Gopal
Varma, Mani Ratnam, Prakash Jha, Mani Kaul,
Kumar Shahani, Ketan Mehta, Govind Nihalani,
Sudhir Mishra, Jahnu Barua and Ritoparno
Ghosh are new faces of socially sensitive and
relevant cinema.
