<h3>Economics: An Introduction</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Definition of Economics</i></strong></div>

There are three representative definitions of
economics, which encompass major dimensions
of the subject. They are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Adam Smith defined economics as the
'Science of Wealth'. (Material Definition)</li>
        <li>Economics is a study of mankind in the
ordinary business of life; it examines that
part of individual and social action which
is most closely connected with the attainment 
and with the use of material requisites of well being' (Welfare Definition).</li>
        <li>Professor Robbins in his 'Nature and Significance of Economic Science (1932)' 
defined economics as 'the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship 
between ends and scarce means which have
alternative uses' (Behavioral Definition).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Macro and Micro Economics</i></strong></div>

Ranger Frisch used the terms macro and
micro economics first in 1953. The subject matter of economics and its various concepts can
be classified either in 'microeconomics' or macroeconomics' for the sake of convenience of
study. Microeconomics is the study of units
whereas macroeconomics is the study of aggregates. As its name implies, microeconomics
is concerned mainly with small segments of the
total economy, i.e., behaviour and decision of
individual consumer or producer or group of
consumers and producers that form a market
unit. Microeconomics is about production or
consumption of an individual unit, demand and
supply of an individual unit, price and output
determination of an individual unit, etc. On
the other hand Macroeconomics is the study of
'whole' or 'aggregate' such as national income,
aggregate saving, aggregate demand, aggregate
supply, etc.

Positive versus Normative economics
In Economics, mainly there are two types of
approaches- positive and normative; the former
approach deals with "what is" and the latter
with "what should be". In positive economics
we describe, explain and understand the economic 
phenomena "as they are" while in normative economics we study "what should be"
and we conjecture, suggest and do value judgments to take certain stands on various issues
and judge the worth of economic policies and
stances as good or bad, desirable or undesirable.
So, normative approach is which deals with
"what should be" or "if" and "then" conditions.
<br>
<br>
Fundamental Questions for an Economy
Economics broadly deals with anything,
which has a price or monetary value. This monetary value arises out of two factors:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Unlimited wants and desires of the people.</li>
        <li>Limited/Scarce availability of resources.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Since unlimited needs and wants of the
masses have to be satisfied out of the scarce
and limited resources available, Economics tries
to find out the most efficient allocation of the
scarce resources so that the needs and desires
are satisfied to the best possible extent. The
answers of three fundamental questions of
economics determine the allocation of scarce
resources among its alternative uses. The three
fundamental questions are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>What to produce?</li>
        <li>How to produce?</li>
        <li>For whom to produce?</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The three fundamental questions of economics are resolved differently in different economic
systems. The more important economic systems
are Socialism, Capitalism and Mixed Economy.
Under a Socialist regime, all the resources are
collectively owned. Under Socialism, the questions, what, how and for whom to produce
are decided by the central planners keeping in
view various factors, such as the priorities of
the economy and supply and demand conditions. They assign different quantity of resources
to different products depending on expected
demand and hence let the economy work in a
centrally planned fashion. The socialist
economy, therefore, do not allow the free play
of market forces. Government intervention is
the hallmark of socialist economies.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand capitalism tries to answer all these fundamental questions through
market mechanism. It explains that the invisible hand of free market forces will determine
the above answers to questions. Prices of factors of production and commodities together
with purchasing power of different consumer
groups will determine what to produce, how
to produce and for whom to produce. Thus
market mechanism brings all the commodities
and factor markets in equilibrium.
Mixed Economy involves ownership of factor resources by private as well as public sector. Whereas strategic and core sectors are generally owned by public sector, non-strategic,
capital and consumer goods are open to private sector to compete.
<br>
<br>
Main Features of Capitalism:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Laissez faire or free market.</li>
        <li>Private property.</li>
        <li>Capital owned by capitalists.</li>
        <li>Production done by hired labour.</li>
        <li>Market mechanism (invisible forces of market) determines 
            prices of commodities and
factors of production as well as distribution of products and income.</li>
        <li>Modern day capitalism accepts limited
state intervention.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Market Economy</i></strong></div>

The term market economy is not identical to
capitalism where a corporation hires workers
as a labour commodity to produce material
wealth and boost shareholders profits. 
A "market economy" is an economy in which individuals make economic decisions according to
the principle of supply and demand. A market
economy is a realized social system based on
the division of labour in which the prices of
goods and services are determined in a free
price system set by supply and demand. This is
often contrasted with a planned economy, in
which the central government determines the
price of goods and services using a fixed price
system. Market economies are contrasted with
mixed economy where there the price system
is not entirely free but under some government
control that is not extensive enough to constitute a planned economy. In the real world,
market economies are regulated by society.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Laissez-faire</i></strong></div>

Laissez-faire is a French phrase literally meaning Let do ("allow to do"). From the French
dictum first used by the eighteenth century
physiocrats as an injunction against government interference with trade, it became used
as an economic ideology which advocates minimal state intervention in the economy. Many
writers suggest that laissez-faire capitalism
never existed. It is generally understood to be
a doctrine that maintains that private initiative
and production are best allowed a minimal of
economic interventionism and taxation by the
state beyond what is necessary to maintain individual liberty, peace, security, and property
rights.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Crony capitalism</i></strong></div>

Crony capitalism is a pejorative term describing an allegedly capitalist economy in which
success in business depends on close relationships between businessmen and government
officials. It may be exhibited by favoritism in
the distribution of legal permits, government
grants, special tax breaks, and so forth. Crony
capitalism is believed to arise when political
cronyism spills over into the business world;
self-serving friendships and family ties between
businessmen and the government influence the
economy and society to the extent that it corrupts public-serving economic and political
ideals.In its lightest form, crony capitalism consists of collusion among market players.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialism</i></strong></div>

Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating state or
collective ownership and administration of the
means of production and distribution of goods.
Modern socialism originated in the late nineteenth-century working class political movement. Karl Marx posited that socialism would
be achieved via class struggle and a proletarian revolution, it being the transitional stage
between capitalism and communism.
<br>
<br>
Features of classical form of socialism

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Productive resources owned by states.</li>
        <li>No private property.</li>
        <li>State intervention.</li>
        <li>State employed workers.</li>
        <li>Centrally planned economies.</li>
        <li>Production and distribution decisions
taken by a central agency.</li>
        <li>Administered prices.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Socialism is not a discrete philosophy of fixed
doctrine and program; its branches advocate a
degree of social interventionism and economic
interventionism, sometimes opposing each other
- especially the reformists and the revolutionaries. Some advocate complete nationalization
of the means of production, distribution, and
exchange; social democrats propose selective
nationalization of key national industries in
mixed economies combined with tax-funded
welfare programs; libertarian socialists advocate co-operative worker ownership of the
means of production; most Marxists (some inspired by the Soviet economic model), advocate centrally-planned economies. By contrast,
Social-Anarchists, Luxemburgists, the U.S. New
Left and various forms of libertarian socialism
favor decentralized ownership via co-operative
workers' councils and participatory planning.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Market socialism</i></strong></div>

Market socialism is a term used to denote
two different economic system(s) based in socialism which operate according to market principles. The first term relates to an economy
directed and guided by socialist planners on
either a local or state level. The earliest models of this
form of market socialism were developed by
Enrico Barone (1908) and Oskar R. Lange
(1936). Lange and Fred M. Taylor proposed
that central planning boards set prices through
"trial and error," making adjustments as shortages 
and surpluses occurred rather than relying on a free price mechanism. If there were
shortages, prices would be raised; if there were
surpluses, prices would be lowered. Raising the
prices would encourage businesses to increase
production, driven by their desire to increase
their profits, and in doing so eliminate the shortage. Lowering the prices would encourage
businesses to curtail production in order to
prevent losses, which would eliminate the surplus. 
Therefore, it would be a simulation of the
market mechanism, which Lange thought
would be capable of effectively managing supply and demand. There are a few examples of
market socialism in the contemporary world.
Market mechanisms have been utilized in a
handful of socialist states, such as Yugoslavia
and even Cuba to a very limited extent. The
People's Republic of China is run by the Communist Party, but its economy involves considerable private enterprise and market forces in
both private and public sectors.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Communism</i></strong></div>

Communism is a socioeconomic structure
that promotes the establishment of an egalitarian, classless, stateless society based on common ownership of the means of production and
property in general. It is usually considered to
be a branch of socialism, a broad group of social and political ideologies, which draws on
the various political and intellectual movements
with origins in the work of theorists of the
Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, although socialist historians say they are
older. Communism attempts to offer an alternative to the problems believed to be inherent
with capitalist economies and the legacy of
imperialism and nationalism. Communism
states that the only way to solve these problems would be for the working 
class, or proletariat, to replace the wealthy bourgeoisie, which
is currently the ruling class, in order to establish a 
peaceful, free society, without classes, or
government. The dominant forms of communism, such as Leninism, Stalinism, Maoism and
Trotskyism are based on Marxism, but nonMarxist versions of 
communism (such as Christian communism and anarchist communism)
also exist and are growing in importance since
the fall of the Soviet Union Planned economy
or Directed economy or Command economy.
<br>
<br>
Planned Economy: A planned economy or
directed economy is an economic system in
which the state or government manages the
economy. Its most extensive form is referred to
as a command economy, centrally planned
economy, or command and control economy.
In such economies, the state or government
controls all major sectors of the economy and
formulates all decisions about their use and
about the distribution of income, much like a
communist state. The planners decide what
should be produced and direct enterprises to
produce those goods.
<br>
<br>
Unplanned Economy: Planned economies are
in contrast to unplanned economies, such as a
market economy, where production, distribution, pricing, 
and investment decisions are made
by the private owners of the factors of production 
based upon their own and their customers' interests rather than upon furthering some
overarching macroeconomic plan.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mixed Economy</i></strong></div>

A mixed economy is an economic system
that incorporates aspects of more than one economic system. This usually means an economy
that contains both privately-owned and stateowned enterprises or that combines elements
of capitalism and socialism, or a mix of market
economy and planned economy characteristics.
There is not one single definition for a mixed
economy, but relevant aspects include: a degree of private economic freedom (including
privately owned industry) intermingled with
centralized economic planning (which may
include intervention for environmentalism and
social welfare, or state ownership of some of
the means of production). The term "mixed
economy" arose in the context of political debate in the United Kingdom in the postwar
period, although the set of policies later associated with the term had been advocated from
at least the 1930s. Supporters of the mixed
economy, including R.H. Tawney, Anthony
Crosland and Andrew Shonfield were mostly
associated with the British Labour Party, although 
similar views were expressed by Conservatives, including Harold Macmillan. India
and France are examples of mixed economies.
With varying degrees all contemporary 
economies are mixed economies because pure capitalism or pure communism are a misnomer.

    <ul>
        <li>Elements of both socialism and capitalism.</li>
        <li>Both public and private investment.</li>
        <li>Freedom to buy, sell, and profit.</li>
        <li>Economic planning by the state.</li>
        <li>Significant regulations (e.g. wage or price
controls) combined with, including taxes,
tariffs, and state-directed investment.</li>
    </ul>
