<h3>State Of The Indian Economy</h3>

State of the Indian Economy
With 1.2 billion people and the world’s
fourth largest economy, India’s recent growth
and development has been one of the most
significant achievements. Over the six and half
decades since independence, the country has
brought about a landmark agricultural
revolution that has transformed the nation from
chronic dependence on grain imports into a
global agricultural powerhouse that is now a
net exporter of food. Life expectancy has more
than doubled, literacy rates have quadrupled,
health conditions have improved, and a sizeable middle class has emerged. India is now
home to globally- recognized companies in
pharmaceuticals and steel and information and
space technologies, and a growing voice on the
international stage that is more in keeping with
its enormous size and potential. At the same
time, the country is in the midst of a massive
wave of poverty and unemployment.
<br>
<br>
 The foremost reason for slowing growth
rate in India during the first half of 2012-13 is
weakening industrial growth in the context of
tight monetary policy followed by the Reserve
Bank of India (RBI) through most of 2011-12,
and continued uncertainty in the global economy.
The other reasons are listed below:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The slowdown in growth in advanced
economies and near recessionary conditions
prevailing in Europe resulted in decrement
of exports along with poor inflows of foreign
investments in the country.</li>
        <li>As India is an energy deficient nation,
thus, it is mainly dependent on import of
crude oil. This is leading to higher current
account deficit.</li>
        <li>Rainfall in the monsoon season of 2012-13
has been below normal, particularly in the
key months of June and July. This affected
sowing and resulted in a lower growth rate
of agriculture and allied sectors.</li>
        <li>The Reserve Bank of India followed a tight
monetary policy to control inflation,
although there has been some relaxation
in the recent months in the Statutory
Liquidity Ratio (SLR) as well as Cash
Reserve Requirement (CRR).</li>
        <li>Poor implementation of infrastructure
projects failed to provide proper boost to
the economy . Further delay in passage of
projects due to red-tapism has reduced
the investments in infrastructure.</li>
        <li>The service sector declined due to a
reduction in the growth rate of ‘Trade,
hotels, transport and communications’
sector as these are demand driven sector
and high inflation is forcing people to
invest less in these sector.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

However India is expected to record 6.1
per cent gross domestic product (GDP) growth
in the current fiscal. The growth is expected to
increase further to 6.7 per cent in 2014-15,
according to the World Bank's latest India
Development Update. While, the Prime
Minister's Economic Advisory Panel expects the
economic growth rate to increase to 6.4 per
cent in 2013-14 from 5 per cent during 2012-
13, on back of improvement in performance of
agriculture and manufacturing sectors.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PRESENT STATUS OF INDIAN ECONOMY</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Agriculture Sector</i></strong></div>

As per the National Accounts Statistics,the
agriculture and allied sector registered a growth
of 2.1 per cent during the first half of2012-13
which is lower than the growth rate of 3.4 per
cent in the first half of 2011-12.
Further average annual growth of the
agriculture and allied sector during the Eleventh
Five year Plan at 3.6 per cent fell short of the
4 per cent growth target. Realized growth,
however, has been much higher than the
average annual growth of 2.5 and 2.4 per cent
achieved during the Ninth and Tenth Plans,
respectively.
<br>
<br>
Growth has also been reasonably stable
despite large weather shocks during 2009
(deficient south west monsoon), 2010-11
(drought/deficient rainfall in some states), and
2012-13 (delayed and deficient monsoon). An
important reason for this dynamism was stepup in the gross capital formation (GCF) in this
sector relative to GDP of this sector, which has
consistently been improving from 16.1 per cent
in 2007-8 to 19.8 per cent in 2011-12 (at
constant 2004-5 prices)
<br>
<br>
Overall GCF in agriculture (including the
allied sector) almost doubled in last 10 years
and registered a compound average annual
growth of 8.1 per cent. Rate of growth of GCF
accelerated to 9.7 per cent in the Eleventh Plan
(2007-12) compared to a growth of 2.7 per cent
during the Tenth Plan (2002-07). Average
annual growth of private investment at 12.5
per cent during Eleventh Plan (first four years)
was significantly higher as against nearly
stagnant investment during the Tenth Plan.
But there has been a decline in overall area
under foodgrains during 2011-12 (2nd Advance
Estimates) as compared to 2010-11. The area
coverage under foodgrains during 2011-12
stood at 1254.92 lakh ha compared to 1267.65
lakh ha last year. The lower area under
foodgrains has been due to a shortfall in the
area under jowar in Maharashtra, Rajasthan
and Gujarat; bajra in Maharashtra, Gujarat and
Haryana; and in pulses in Maharashtra, Uttar
Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Rajasthan.
However the area under coarse cereals and
oilseeds has also come down as compared to
the previous year. The area coverage under rice
during 2011-12 is around 444.06 lakh ha which
15.44 lakh is ha more than the previous year.
The area coverage under sugarcane during the
current year has slightly improved to 50.81 lakh
ha, higher by about 1.96 lakh hectares as
compared to the previous year, and the area
under cotton has increased significantly to
121.78 lakh ha as compared to 112.35 lakh ha
during 2010-11
<br>
<br>
The agriculture, including allied activities,
accounted for only 14.1 per cent of the GDP at
constant (2004-5) prices in 2011-12, its role in
the country's economy as its share in total
employment according to the 2001 census is
58.2 per cent. The declining share of the
agriculture and allied sector in the country's
GDP is consistent with normal development
trajectory of any economy, but fast agricultural
growth remains vital for jobs, incomes, and the
food security. The growth target for agriculture
in the Twelfth Five Year Plan remains at 4 per
cent, as in the Eleventh Five Year Plan.
Agricultural production in the country is
greatly influenced by policies such as pricing,
procurement, storage, etc. The Minimum
Support Prices (MSPs) for major crops have
been raised substantially by the Government in
2012, in line with the objective of ensuring
remunerative prices to farmers for their produce
and with a view to encouraging higher
investment and production in the sector. This
policy also resulted in higher procurement of
foodgrains by Food Corporation of India (FCI)
and the State agencies. The procured foodgrains
are being made available to the consumers
under the targeted public distribution system
(TPDS) at central issue prices(CIPs) that are
much less than the economic costs to the
procuring agencies.
<br>
<br>
Reasons for slow growth in agriculture sector:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Slowdown in agriculture growth.</li>
            <li>Weak Framework for Sustainable Water
Management and Irrigation.</li>
            <li>Stringent land regulations discourage rural
investments.</li>
            <li>Rural poor have little access to credit.</li>
            <li>Weak Natural Resources Management.</li>
            <li>Excessive use of chemical inputs are
decreasing rate of fertility of soil.</li>
            <li>Frequent floods and droughts.</li>
            <li>Irregular monsoon.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industrial Sector</i></strong></div>    

As per the IIP, industrial output growth
rate during April-September 2012-13 was 0.1
per cent as compared to 5.1 per cent in AprilSeptember 2011-12. The Mining sector
production has contracted in the last six
quarters. The contraction in the current year
was largely because of decline in natural gas
and crude petroleum output. Manufacturing,
which is the dominant sector in industry, also
witnessed deceleration in growth, as did the
electricity sector. There was, however, a sharp
pick-up in growth in October 2012 with
manufacturing growth improving to 9.8 per
cent, the highest recorded since June, 2011.
Growth, however, turned negative in November
and December, 2012 and was placed at (-) 0.8
per cent and (-) 0.6 per cent, respectively. Gross
capital formation (GCF) in the industrial sector
comprising mining, manufacturing, electricity
and construction recorded negative during
2008-09 and again in 2011-12.
<br>
<br>
The major cause of manufacturing sluggishness
are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Drop of investment in new projects due
to the slower rate of growth in
disbursement of bank credit. Further
adverse business sentiment is also leading
to lower investment.</li>
        <li>Decline in capital goods, natural gas, crude
petroleum, and fertilizers output.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure bottlenecks has impinged on
the performance of the mining and
electricity sectors.</li>
        <li>High inflation and high interest rates
which has made borrowing costs higher.</li>
        <li>The global economic slowdown.</li>
        <li>Supply-side bottlenecks such as inadequate
infrastructure, inadequacy of fuel supply
linkages and delays in project clearances
of large manufacturing and infrastructure
projects.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

However as per the survey by HSBC Indian
manufacturing and services sectors expanded
more than China in February 2013. The HSBC
composite index for India for manufacturing
and services stood at 54.8 in February 2013,
whereas it was 51.4 for China.
<br>
<br>
The Government has been taking
confidence building measures for improving the
industrial climate and manufacturing in the
country. Three important initiatives taken in
this regard are announcement of National
Manufacturing Policy (NMP), implementation
of Delhi Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC)
Project and policy reforms to promote Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI).
<br>
<br>
In addition, the Government has initiated
implementation of the e-Biz Project, a Mission
Mode Project under the National e-Governance
Plan (NeGP) for promoting an online single
window at the national level for business users.
The objectives of setting up of the e-Biz Portal
are to provide a number of services to business
users, covering the entire life cycle on their
operation. The project aims at enhancing
India’s business competitiveness through a
service oriented, event-driven G2B interaction.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Service Sector</i></strong></div>

The share of services in India’s GDP at
factor cost (at current prices) increased from
33.3 per cent in 1950-51 to 56.5 per cent in
2012-13. With an 18.0 per cent share, trade,
hotels, and restaurants as a group is the largest
contributor to GDP among the various services
sub-sectors, followed by financing, insurance,
real estate, and business services with a 16.6
per cent share. Both these services showed
perceptible improvement in their shares over
the years. Community, social, and personal
services with a share of 14.0 per cent is in third
place. Construction, a borderline services
inclusion, is at fourth place with an 8.2 percent share.
<br>
<br>
The HSBC Markit services Purchasing
Managers' Index (PMI), which gauges business
activity from a survey of over 400 companies
ranging from banks to hospitals, stood at 50.7
in April 2013
Indian service sector enjoyed foreign direct
investment (FDI) inflows amounting to US$
4.75 billion during April-February 2012-13,
according to the recent statistics released by
the Department of Industrial Policy and
Promotion (DIPP).
<br>
<br>
As the Indian economy is gaining due to
growth in service sector, government has taken
many new initiatives to boost service industry
in India.
The initiatives are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Liberalized the FDI policy for the services
sector. These include liberalising the policy
on foreign investment for companies
operating in the broadcasting sector, like
increasing the foreign investment limit
from 49 per cent to 74 per cent in teleports
(setting up up-linking HUBs/teleports)
and direct to home (DTH) and cable
networks, and permitting foreign
investment of up to 74 per cent in mobile
TV. Foreign airlines have also been
permitted to make investment up to 49
per cent in scheduled and non-scheduled
air transport services. FDI, up to 51 per
cent, in multi-brand retail trading and
amended the existing policy on FDI in
single-brand product retail trading.</li>
        <li>The insurance sector could invest in the
capital markets and other than traditional
insurance products, various market link
insurance products were available to the
end customer to choose from.</li>
        <li>Rajiv Gandhi Equity Saving Scheme: to
allow income tax deduction to retail
investors on investing in equities.</li>
        <li>Insurance companies has been empowered
to open branches in Tier II cities and
below without prior approval of IRDA.</li>
        <li>All towns of India with a population of
10,000 or more will have an office of LIC
and an office of at least one public sector
general insurance company.</li>
        <li>An ambitious IT driven project to
modernise the postal network at a cost of
Rs. 4,909 crore. Post offices to become part
of the core banking solution and offer real
time banking services.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Price Indices and Inflation</i></strong></div>

The headline inflation measured in terms
of Wholesale Price Index (WPI) in 2012-13
(April-December) averaged 7.55 per cent as
compared to 9.44 per cent during the
corresponding period in 2011-12. Inflation has
been in the range of 7-8 per cent in the last
twelve months. Overall WPI food inflation
comprising primary food articles and
manufactured food products, with a weight of
24.31 per cent, averaged 9.08 per cent in 2012-
13 (April-December) as compared to 7.91 per
cent during the corresponding period in 2011-12. 
In December 2012, food inflation was 10.39
per cent as compared to 2.70 per cent during
December 2011. The persistently elevated prices for animal
products (eggs, meat and fish), the rise in the
prices of cereals and vegetables, along with the
increase in international prices of fertilizers
(non-urea) and the increase in administered
prices of diesel have contributed to inflation to
differing degrees over time.
<br>
<br>
The Consumer Price inflation for major
indices generally followed a similar trend. The
CPI-IW inflation in 2012-13 (April-December)
averaged 10.0 per cent as compared to 8.82
per cent in the same period last year. The
Central Statistics Office (CSO) launched a new
series of Consumer Price indices from January
2011. All India general inflation for CPI-NS
averaged 10.04 per cent in 2012-13 (AprilDecember) and was placed at 10.56 per cent in
December 2012. Inflation based on other group
specific CPIs (CPI for Agricultural Labourers and
CPI for Rural Labourers) also remained in double
digit in December 2012. While part of the higher
CPI inflation reflects the high weight of food in
the consumption basket (46 – 69 per cent), price
pressures have persisted in services and housing,
which are included in the CPI basket.
The reasons behind persistent inflation are
(a) higher international prices of crude, precious
metals, edible oil etc. (b) change in dietary
pattern leading to structural demand supply
mismatch for protein rich items (c) revision in
MSP prices for some of the essential
commodities (d) revision in petroleum prices in
September 2012 among others. Inflation has
been a major cause of concern for both the
Government and Reserve Bank of India who
are taking a number of measures to contain it
as indicated.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>RBI has reduced the policy repo rate under
the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by
25 basis points from 7.5 per cent to 7.25
per cent with immediate effect.</li>
        <li>The reverse repo rate under the LAF,
determined with a spread of 100 basis
points below the repo rate, stands
adjusted to 6.25 per cent with immediate
effect.</li>
        <li>The Bank Rate stands adjusted to 8.25 per
cent with immediate effect.</li>
        <li>The cash reserve ratio (CRR) of scheduled
banks has been retained at 4.0 per cent of
their net demand and time liabilities
(NDTL).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trade</i></strong></div>

India is the 19th largest merchandise
exporter and 12th largest importer in the world
with shares of 1.7 per cent and 2.5 per cent in
world exports and imports respectively in 2011,
as per the World Trade Organization (WTO).
In commercial services, India is the 8th largest
exporter and 7th largest importer in the world
with shares of 3.3 per cent and 3.1 per cent in
world exports and imports respectively.
The rate of growth of India’s exports was
40.5 per cent in 2010-11. It decelerated in 2011-
12 to 21.3 per cent. During 2012-13 (April-
December), exports were valued at US$ 214.1
billion, registering a negative growth of 5.5 per
cent over the level of US$ 226.5 billion in 2011-
12 (April-December). Value of imports during
this period was US$ 361.3 billion, which
was marginally lower by 0.7 per cent than the
level of US$ 363.9 billion in the corresponding
period of 2011-12. Rising crude oil prices,
along with increase in gold and silver prices
have contributed significantly to the import bill.
Of the total imports, Petrol oil and lubricants
imports accounted for US$ 124.5 billion
(34.5 per cent of total import) in AprilDecember 2012. This was 12.2 per cent
higher than the level of US$ 111.0 billion in
2011-12 (April-December). Non-Petrol oil and
lubricants imports during 2012-13 (AprilDecember) valued at US$ 236.7 billion, were
6.4 per cent lower than the level of US$ 252.9
billion in 2011-12 (April-December).
Consequently, trade deficit for 2012-13 (AprilDecember) increased to US$ 147.2 billion vis-avis US$ 137.3 billion in 2011-12 (AprilDecember).
Thus the biggest risk to the economy stems
from the CAD which was historically the
highest and well above the sustainable level of
2.5 per cent of GDP as estimated by the Reserve
Bank. The priority has therefore been to reduce
CAD through improving trade balances. Efforts
have been made to promote exports by
diversifying the export commodity basket and
export destinations.
<br>
<br>
<b>Recent Measures taken by the government to
boost exports</b>
<br>
The Union Minister for Commerce,
Industry and Textiles has recently announced
additional incentives to boost exports. These
incentives came in the backdrop of the Annual
Supplement of the Foreign Trade Policy
announced on June 5, 2012. According to the
new guidelines the 2% Interest Subvention
Scheme on rupee export credit which is
available to certain specific sectors including
handicrafts, carpets, handloom, readymade
garments, processed agriculture products, sports
goods and toys, has been given an extension
up to March 31, 2014. At present, the Scheme
is scheduled to end on 31st March 2013. Along
with this, Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs) for all sectors will now be able to avail
the benefits of the Scheme.
<br>
<br>
The scheme has been extended to certain
specific sub-sectors of the engineering sector.
Government has also announced the
introduction of a “pilot scheme” of 2% Interest
Subvention for Project Exports through EXIM
Bank for countries of SAARC region, Africa
and Myanmar. The interest subvention would
be linked to the Buyer’s Credit Scheme which
was introduced in the last financial year being
implemented through EXIM Bank, ECGC and
the National Export Insurance Account. The
“objective of the scheme is to boost India’s
exports in these countries by providing long
term concessional credit through EXIM Bank,
as co-financing in infrastructure sectors such
as drinking water, housing, irrigation, road
projects, renewable energy, etc.
Apart from these, five new countries have
been added under the Focus Market Scheme
while Eritrea has been added under the Special
Focus Market Scheme. The five countries being
added under FMS are New Zealand, Cayman
Islands, Latvia, Lithuania and Bulgaria. Under
FMS Duty Credit of 3 per cent is given on the
FoB value of exports. Sixty new products which
include Engineering, Rubber, Textiles, Drugs &
Pharmaceuticals products among others, and
three countries (Taiwan, Thailand and Czech
Republic) have been incorporated under the
Market Linked Focus Product Scheme.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Banking Sector</i></strong></div>

Banks as financial intermediaries collect
deposits from savers and on-lend these to
investors and others. The deposits of banks form
the basis of their lending operations. Aggregate
deposits of the banking sector increased from
an average of Rs. 48,019.8 billion in 2010-11 to
Rs. 64,362.3 billion during Q3 of 2012-13.
Year-on-year growth of aggregate deposits,
however, moderated from an average of 17.9
per cent in Q1 of 2011-12 to 12.87 in Q3 of
2012-13.
<br>
<br>
Money supply (M3) growth was around
14.0 per cent during Q1 of 2012-13 but
decelerated thereafter to 11.2 per cent by endDecember as time deposit growth slowed down.
There was some pick up in deposit mobilization
in Q4, taking deposit growth to 14.3 per cent
by end-March. Consequently, M3 growth
reached 13.3 per cent by end-March 2013,
slightly above the revised indicative trajectory
of 13.0 per cent.
