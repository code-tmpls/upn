<h3>Planning</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Overview of Indian planning</i></strong></div>

When India became independent in 1947,
it was gripped by mass poverty, literacy,
unemployment, low industrial development,
etc. After the independence the leaders of
independent India had to decide on the type
of economic system most suitable for our nation
based on the principles guided by the Directive
Principles i.e. a system which would promote
the welfare of all rather than a few.
The Directive Principles of the Constitution
lays down that: the State will direct its policy
towards securing that a) all citizens, men and
women equally have a right to an adequate means
of livelihood; b) the ownership and control of the
resources of community are so distributed as best
to achieve common good; c) economic development
should not lead to concentration of wealth.
There were mainly two types of economic
systems: Capitalist and Socialist and among
them, socialism has been chosen by Jawaharlal
Nehru however not in toto. Nehru, and many
other leaders and thinkers of the newly
independent India, sought an alternative to the
extreme versions of capitalism and socialism
i.e. a mixed economy where private and public
entities will collaborate together to achieve a
suitable economic development. Thus Indian
government after being formally declared
republic in January 1950, embarked on a
strategy of five year plans which spells some
general goals as well as specific objectives which
are to be achieved within a specified period of
time. (Planning means a systematic utilization
of the available resources at a progressive rate
so as to secure an increase in output, national
dividend, employment and social welfare of
people).
<br>
<br>
Economic planning refers to any directing
or planning of economic activity by the state,
in an attempt to achieve specific economic or
social outcomes. Planning is an economic
mechanism for resource allocation and
decision–making in contrast with the market
mechanism. Most economies are mixed
economies, incorporating elements of market
mechanisms and planning for distributing
inputs and outputs and India is one of them.
India adopted planning in the 1950s as a
vehicle of its development. Planning derives its
objectives and social promises from the Directive
Principles of State Policy enshrined in the
Constitution. The country has completed ten
Five Year Plans and is currently engaged in
implementing the Eleventh Plan.
<br>
<br>
Each Plan registers gains–and some
inadequacies. The succeeding Plan should take
full cognizance of all these changes, no less
than their implications. The broad goals and
objectives of the State Plan are generally in
conformity with the National Plan although the
strategies, thrust areas and programmes may
vary.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Issues in Development</i></strong></div>

The immediate goal for achievement was
to increase living standard, decrease in poverty,
increase in agricultural and industrial
production, employment, savings and capital
formation and improvements in infrastructure.
Apart from the overall development, achieving
some social objectives was also given prime
importance as India followed Soviet model of
socialist form of production. Among social
objectives reducing income inequalities and
reaching benefits of development to deprived
sections of population were considered of prime
importance.
<br>
<br>
Achievement of the fore mentioned goal was
not an easy task as the state of infrastructure
was awry, low availability of capitals, unskilled
and ill equipped labour force and low
productivities in most of the sectors. Along with
these problems the other factors that hindered
development were reaching of the benefits of
the developments to the lowest strata of society,
translating investment into production.
Similarly, translation of the savings into
productive investments, increasing savings to
finance capitals, financing of current and
capital consumption were some other problems
that were encountered in the process of
development. The inadequate financial
infrastructure and absence of well developed
financial market entailed the problem of such
fruitful conversion of whatever little savings
were available for finance.
<br>
<br>
Other structural backwardness relate to
major obstacle to development of the economy.
These structural backwardness pertained
mainly due to acute deficiency of capital, low
rate of capital accumulation due to low capacity
to save and inadequacies in converting the
domestic savings into productive investment
due to lack of infrastructure. Also, agriculture
sector was marked with underemployed
labourers, reducing productivities and
diminishing returns due to fragmentation of
holdings.
<br>
<br>
Another problem faced by the formulators
was the limited choices available in the form of
trade off between present and future
consumption. Policy formulators faced with the
problem of financing current consumption at
the cost of foregoing capital formation with
small availability of limited finance and
budgetary provisions to increase expenditure.
The other major policy dilemma was bringing
the social justice by reducing the inequalities in
income, on the other hand allowing some
inequalities to foster to create new class of
entrepreneurs in the society.
Technical Approach for Planning in India
The techniques that are applied in economic
planning can be broadly classified under overall
regulation of economic activities through fiscal
and monetary measures and the other is
through sectoral policies to regulate the
economic activities. The sectoral policies were
based on the objectives to have a balanced
regional growth. The Indian planners followed
expansionist fiscal and monetary measures as
would have done by any of the developing
countries to increase the income and spending.
Demand and supply management became
a major concern with the growing economy as
the structure became more complicated. Later
on persistent inflationary pressures build up
limited the scope of monetary policies. Initially
it was assumed that in process this could get
corrected with the passage of time by itself given
unlimited supply of foreign exchange that can
be utilized to finance imports. The imports
would also help in augmenting the domestic
supplies that would help in controlling demand.
Initially the fiscal policies that was sought
to be expansionist was sought through deficit
financing, which later on could get controlled
by controlling and curtailing government
expenditures. But later on large government
deficit became a major problem as most of the
revenues from the taxes were utilized in deficit
financing. It left little scope for social sector
development finance.
<br>
<br>
Among different sectors agricultural output
and development were sought to be augmented
by developing suitable developmental
programmes and providing assistance to the
farmers to help bridge the credit gap.
Subsequently, government also resorted to
providing subsidy to provide agricultural
assistance for inputs. Also industries like
chemicals and fertilizers were also subsidized
for many years and are still being done so to
develop agricultural. However in subsidization
of the industries and the sectors it became a
major hurdle in germinating inefficiencies and
uncompetitiveness of these industries that
became a burden rather than of any help.
In absence of free market the price
mechanism fell into sole and whole purview of
the government. Various price policies were
formulated that helped regulate the supply and
demand in different sectors. Thus industries and
agriculture were subjected to various price
control mechanism. Industrial pricing were
introduced. In the sixties agricultural price
commission was also established to control the
agricultural prices of important food grains and
commodities. Apart from the price control
mechanism these sectors were also subjected to
various qualitative and quantitative controls.
In agricultural sector pricing public
distribution system and procurement policies
played an important role. Building
infrastructure like public distribution system
would help the government in directly
influencing the market price. This would help
government in controlling the agricultural prices
and checking inflationary pressures due to
increases in food prices. In case of inflationary
pressures the government through increasing
its market intervention can augment the market
supply of commodities.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PLANNING HISTORY</i></strong></div>

The planning history can be discussed as a
constituent of two phases. First phase
constituting of sustained growth phase for the
years from 1950–51 to 1964–65. Second phase
constituting since 1964–65 till date has been
termed as slowing down phase. The growth
phase constituted for the first three plans i.e.
1st, 2nd, 3rd plan periods, country’s output or
production, per–capita income, infrastructural
developments in terms of establishing
institutions and industrial as well as financial
infrastructure, all grew at phenomenal rate
however rate was slower than projected in plan.
However the growth rates trailed behind as
per the projections in the plan documents. In
discussing the plan history it is most important
to discuss the second plan as it marks the
turning point for Indian economy as the growth
trajectory was based on the basis of
Mahalanobis formulation.
<br>
<br>
The economic growth was expected to take
place through modern industrialization, thus
expected to be replica of industrialization in
advanced countries. But in the Mahalanobis
strategy stress were placed on import
substitution by developing the countries
capabilities in producing capital goods. It was
on this line that during the second plan there
were substantial public sector investment in
infrastructure and industries that produced
intermediate goods like steel, coal, power and
heavy electrical machinery. The cottage and
small scale industries expanded only to the
extent that it provided large scale employment
to labour. Thus the phase recorded 8 to 10 per
cent growth in industrial output, 3–3.5 per cent
growth in agricultural output and 1.75%
growth in per capita income.
<br>
<br>
During First Plan Year that is in 1951-56
was a reflection of basically reconstructing the
tattered economy and establishing infrastructure
and institution to enable the country run on its
own. Initially the planners formulated policies
based on supply side of the economy ignoring
any deficiencies in aggregate demand. Also the
public investment in the areas in sectors that
had large gestation lag, public utilities and
sectors that required heavy investment were
taken to be of prime importance. Thus in the
initial plan document investment in public
sector unit that were of importance to the
country’s defence like arms and ammunitions,
artilleries, infrastructure like power, road
transport and railways were undertaken. Also
developing heavy industries like electrical
industries, iron and steel, aluminium, etc. were
undertaken. Apart from this public investment
in agriculture sector were also undertaken to
increase the production as well as the
productivities.
<br>
<br>
Second plan for the growth of economy was
given the prime importance. During this plan
investments were increased to promote
industrial development thus taking
industrialization as the impetus for growth.
Industrialization based on Mahalanobis model
was unveiled. Import substitution and enlarged
public sector investment with focus on
establishing PSUs in the areas that required
huge investment were given importance.
Third Plan and Fourth Plan were resultants
of repercussion of first and second plans when
the formulators realized that industrialization
alone without giving adequate attention to other
sector growth resulted in failure of 1st & 2nd
Plan. Thus the need to develop agriculture
sector and infrastructure was paid attention to
in these plans. It was during these years that
Green Revolution was undertaken to boost
agricultural production with the help of
increase in yield. Thus, taking the country back
to growth strategies with overall development
taking place in almost all the sectors of the
economy. It was during this time period that
the government formulated suitable agricultural
price policy and came up with public
distribution system concept. These two policies
helped the government in getting the control
of the market where it enabled the government
on playing a more proactive role in dealing
with situations of price rise and food security.
Also it helped the government in addressing
the issues of poverty where it tried to provide
the people living below poverty with food grains
through rationing.
<br>
<br>
During Fifth and Sixth five year plan a shift
in strategies were warranted as the population
growth rate became very high making all the
plan formulation fail. Thus these two plans
were based on assessment of the economic
situation. Though during these two plans the
prime concern remained increasing GDP
growth rate with focus on overall development
along with increasing the per capita income.
In the back drop the population control became
major concern of the formulators. With growth
in population above the natural rate some other
issues became pertinent like issues of growing
unemployment, decrease in productivities,
inefficient use of capital, issues of growing
demand for food and other items, increasing
urbanization leading to migration, increasing
landless laborers, decrease in agricultural
productivities even after experiencing initial
spurt of green revolution due to lack of
infrastructure and inputs, building up of
inflationary pressures and illiteracy. These
factors were supposed to form the basis of
seventh plan.
<br>
<br>
Increasing population and growing
demands led to increasing need to improve the
agricultural production not only to make the
economy self reliant but also to meet the other
impending factors arising out of it like
enhanced need to achieve a food security
system. Though improving the existing pds and
procurement system played an important role,
however increasing agricultural productivities
by expanding green revolution to other crops
like rice and other cereals did form the original
basis to achieve the goal. Apart from this
improving agricultural infrastructure increasing
irrigation and extension of credit assistance,
these issues were also addressed.
Besides agriculture sectors manufacturing
and other secondary sector industrial problems
were also scrutinized and addressed. Basic
issues that were identified were low
productivities in secondary sector, low capacity
utilization of existing capital resources and
incompetetiveness in terms of cost and scale of
operations of some of the public sector units
came up. Some other factors that contributed
to these inefficiencies in running were excessive
protection provided to these organizations. Thus
the seventh plan was targeted to address these
issues. There was shift in focus of planning for
industry away from getting in any new
investment to existing optimum capacity
utilization and productivity enhancement.
In the external sector appropriate export
policies were also postulated to improve the
countries balance of payment position.
Shrinking external assistance was also one of
the factors that compelled the policy makers to
look for export sectors as an alternative. Thus
the seventh plan postulates the integration of
export policy with all policies and programmes
that affected productivity and costs.
Growing unemployment, lack of skilled
laborers, increasing illiteracy, increasing
migration of rural laborers to the urban areas
as effect of urbanization led to developing new
policies to increase employment and education.
Thus the policies focused on universalisation
of education, increasing educational
infrastructure and skill formation. Also issues
related to unemployment were addressed.
<br>
<br>
Apart from stress on cottage and small scale,
other government programmes that assisted in
addressing the unemployment isssues in rural
and urban areas were also undertaken. Thus
many of the government programmes like
integrated development programmes, trysem
etc were launched that had inbuilt and
integrated component directed to increase
employment. Some of the poverty alleviation
programmes were also launched to address the
issue of increasing poverty like Minimum Needs
Programmes.
<br>
<br>
Eighth Plan and Liberalization in India
During seventh and eighth plan many
factors emerged for non performance of the
economy on the whole with industrial sector
registering almost negligible growth and the
GDP growth rates hovering around 3.5 per
cent. Thus addressing these major issues were
given prime importance in Eighth plan. The
collapse of Rupee Trade area and failure of the
economic off take to targeted growth path led
to a series of reforms in many sectors. The
Eighth plan is also popularly known as
‘Liberalization’ of the economy. The
liberalization policies were unveiled by then
Finance Minister Dr Manmohan Singh in the
year 1991–92. This was accompanied with
substantial opening of the economy.
The frame work for the eighth plan
encompassed four important macroeconomic
aspect related to liberalization. These were the
policy regime governing the trade, technology
and trans-border capital flows; industrial
deregulation and administered price policy;
financial sector reforms; and effective monetary
and fiscal policies enactment to regulate
aggregate demand in the economy. These
policies are discussed briefly in the following
sections.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trade, technology and capital flows</i></strong></div>    
        
Series of trade reforms were carried that
included lowering of customs duties on import
and exports, reducing the negative list items,
lowering of tariff rates applicable and enacting
liberal trade policies. In liberal trade policies
incentives were announced to promote exports
and imports and capital inflows in EXIM
policies. There were substantial reductions in
the import duties from 300 to 150, reducing
tariffs on export to 110 per cent. Also partial
convertibility of rupees was introduced in order
to increase the incentives for exporters. Under
the system exporters or the foreign exchange
earned through the remitters could get
converted to rupees with 40 per cent at the
official exchange rate and 60 per cent of it at
market determined prices.
<br>
<br>
In order to integrate the economy with
external world a series of capital flows policies
were also unveiled to increase the foreign direct
flow in the economy. The regulation that was
liberalized for FDI included technology transfer
through automatic route. The technology
collaboration and equity participation under
automatic route were also allowed up to 51
per cent in almost 31 areas.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Deregulation and Price Policies</i></strong></div>
            
Opening of the economy to external sector
formed one of the parts of liberalization; along
with it privatization of industrial sector formed
another significant part. This was done mainly
by reducing the bureaucratic interference in
industrial operation by liberalizing entry and
exit of the private firms, delicensing of many of
the industrial units, reducing government stake
in industrial sick units either through selling its
stake to other private players or closing down
of the non performing units. However,
disinvestments in large public sector units were
strongly opposed and were carried out
cautiously in phased manner.
<br>
<br>
Policies on small sector units that were non–
performing were to assist in technological
upgradation and modernization. These units
were not shut as these were labour intensive
and provided employment to millions.
Price policy reforms were also introduced
to allow the private players to play dominant
role. Many of the products that were tradable
and the sector in which competition due to
presence of private players was subjected to
market determined prices. Whereas for the units
that were non- tradable goods and services the
government followed long run marginal cost
pricing of the production.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Financial Sector Reform</i></strong></div>
            
Another integral component of the
liberalization policies were financial sector
reforms. Under credit lending and interest
policies were reformed. Increasing role of the
development financial institutions can be
witnessed in this period and was duly
recognized by the government. Under this
regime the lending rates could not be fixed by
these DFIs. Also the interest rates charged could
not be fixed on the basis of the market
conditions by these DFIs.
<br>
<br>
The banking sector was also subjected to
series of reforms. The interest rate structure for
the commercial banks was fixed upward.
Lending credit limits were raised. Besides giving
the banks flexibility to charge credit and lending
rates, partial deregulation of term deposit rates
of the commercial banks were also carried.
Many other reform policies that suited the
new capital market structure where the private
sector companies could also raise funds from
the market through equity participation were
also introduced. Apart from regulations that
controlled foreign exchange operations of the
market were also liberalized. India also adopted
floating system of exchange rate during this
time. Many new forms of financial institutions
like merchant banking, mutual funds, leasing
companies, venture capital companies and
factoring companies also came up. However
regulatory framework for many of these
institutions was developed later.
<br>
<br>
Credit policies related to lending were based
on prioritization. Thus the sectors that were in
the priorities for development by the
government were given easier access to credit.
This helped in developing not only the lagging
sectors but also the lagging regions. Extension
of banking system and culture through
extension services and regional rural banks to
remote places of India were also carried. Earlier
the post offices were the only form that helped
in reaching the rural India. Thus it helped not
only in mass mobilization of capital from rural
savings; at the same time it also helped the
agricultural sector to avail the facilities of
priority lending.
<br>
<br>
The reforms were also marked by substantial
dilution of government stake ownership in the
banks and credit lending agencies. This
happened mainly on account to the redefining
of capital adequacy norms for the banks. The
commercial banks that operated internationally
had to subsume to a capital adequacy ratio of
8 per cent by March 1994 whereas domestic
bank had to accede to a ratio of 4 per cent by
March 1993. In case of the banks failing these
ratio norms had to tap the capital market for
raising funds in the form of loan and equity
participation. This led to decrease of government
ownership stake in many of the commercial
banks.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Monetary and Fiscal Policies</i></strong></div>
            
Monetary and fiscal policies were targeted
to regulate and manage the aggregate demand
in balance with the increasing aggregate supply
so that it would curtail building up of any
inflationary pressures. Prior to eighth plan the
fiscal deficit had grown disastrously at 11 per
cent of the GDP. The eighth plan tried to
achieve a 7 per cent deficit. This was done
mainly by increasing the revenue base by
reforming the tax structure prevalent in the
economy. Also prudent government
expenditure management by pruning the excess
expenditure was sought. The government
expenditure had increased from 19 per cent of
GDP in seventies to 31 per cent of GDP in 1990-
91. This was done by decreasing the non plan
expenditure of the states, controlling
consumption expenditure and reducing
subsidization.
<br>
<br>
The consumption expenditure of the
government rose on account of two variables
defence expenditure and increased
administrative cost. Government tried to reduce
both these cost by reforming the bureaucratic
structures and deregulating the large public
sector units.
<br>
<br>
The subsidy element had increased the
expenditure of the government by 4 per cent in
the year 1990–91. This accounted mainly for
the fertilizer subsidy, food subsidy and interest
rate subsidy. Also other subsidization
programme like rural subsidy for electrification
and others also accounted. Thus government
pruned its expenditure by revising its policies
and withdrawing subsidy given to many of
these units. Subsidy on account of Public
distribution system also formed a major chunk
thus government reduced its PDS operation and
also by reforming the procurement and price
policies followed by the government.
The government also tried to increase its
revenue resources by substantially improving
the tax structure. In it, apart from broadening
the tax base the direct tax structure like income
tax, corporate tax structures were also modified.
Besides improving internal tax, external tariff
structures were improved by reducing the
external tariff to 110 per cent to increase
exports. Lowering of custom duties and other
non tariff barriers helped in expanding the
foreign trade that helped generate revenue in
return. Indirect taxes like sales and excise taxes
were also subjected to reform regulations.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

MODVAT and value added taxes were
introduced to reduce the tax distortions in the
economy. The Chelliah Committee
recommendations for taxes and Official
Committee of the government were the two
main instrumental forces in introducing the tax
reforms in the country. It was on their
suggestion that government reformed the
system that helped in increasing the revenue
from tax.
<br>
<br>
Ninth Five Year Plan India ran through the
period from 1997 to 2002 with the main aim of
attaining objectives like speedy
industrialization, human development, full-scale
employment, poverty reduction, and selfreliance on domestic resources.
The main feature of the Ninth Five Year
Plan India is that at its onset our nation crossed
the fifty years of independence and this called
for a whole new set of development measures.
There was a fresh need felt for increasing the
social and economic developmental measures.
The government felt that the full economic
potentiality of the country, yet to be explored,
should be utilized for an overall growth in the
next five years. As a result in the Ninth Five
Year Plan India, the emphasis was on human
development, increase in the growth rate and
adoption of a full scale employment scheme
for all. For such development one needs to
promote the social sectors of the nation and to
give utmost importance to the eradication of
poverty.
<br>
<br>
The Ninth Five Year Plan of India looks
through the past weaknesses in order to frame
the new measures for the overall socioeconomic development of the country.
However, for a well-planned economy of any
country, there should be a combined
participation of the governmental agencies
along with the general population of that
nation. A combined effort of public, private,
and all levels of government are essential for
ensuring the growth of India’s economy.
<br>
<br>
<b>Objectives of Ninth Five Year Plan:</b>
<br>
The main objectives of the Ninth Five Year Plan
were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To prioritize agricultural sector and
emphasize on the rural development.</li>
        <li>To generate adequate employment
opportunities and promote poverty
reduction.</li>
        <li>To stabilize the prices in order to accelerate
the growth rate of the economy.</li>
        <li>To ensure food and nutritional security.</li>
        <li>To provide for the basic infrastructural
facilities like education for all, safe drinking
water, primary health care, transport,
energy.</li>
        <li>To check the growing population increase.</li>
        <li>To encourage social issues like women
empowerment, conservation of certain
benefits for the Special Groups of the
society.</li>
        <li>To create a liberal market for increase in
private investments.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Tenth Five Year Plan India (2002-2007)
aims to transform the country into the fastest
growing economy of the world and targeted
an annual economic growth of 10%. This was
decided after India registered a 7% GDP growth
consistently over the last decade.
This GDP growth of 7% is much higher
than the world’s average GDP growth rate.
Thus, the Planning Commission of India sought
to stretch the limit and set targets which would
propel India to the super league of industrially
developed countries.
<br>
<br>
In a nutshell, the Tenth Five Year Plan
envisaged:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>More investor friendly flexible economic
reforms.</li>
        <li>Creation of congenial investment
environment.</li>
        <li>Encourage private sector involvement.</li>
        <li>Setting up state-of-the-art infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Capacity building in industry.</li>
        <li>Corporate transparency.</li>
        <li>Mobilizing and optimizing all financial
resources.</li>
        <li>Implementation of friendly industrial policy
instruments.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Eleventh plan vision included overall
improvements of quality of life and welfare of
the deprived section of the population. This
included Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,
other backward castes, minorities and women.
Thus the eleventh plan termed such
developmental growth as inclusive growth of
the country. Also the plan visualised to
integrate the country with global economy,
increasing employment opportunities at home,
reducing poverty, spread of education and skill
development. On numerical front a target of 9
per cent GDP growth every year was targeted
and 7.6 per cent annual growth rate of per
capita income.
<br>
<br>
The focus in this plan shifted from
increasing the income to improving the
livelihood conditions of the population. Until
now the manufacturing sector growth and
tertiary sector formed the core of planning
structure of the five year plan. However in
eleventh plan though the manufacturing and
tertiary sectors were given attention but the
focus shifted to improvement in social and
human capital, including agricultural
development. The budgetary outlay on
improving educational infrastructure and
universalisation of education increased from
meagre 8 per cent in tenth plan to almost 19
per cent. Apart from this the agriculture,
health and rural development expenditure also
tripled.
<br>
<br>
Another prime importance given was on
infrastructure where the expenditure is likely
to go up to 9 per cent of GDP. The public sector
investments also focused on developing the
social capital and addressing the equity issues
in society. Thus many of the government
programmes that strengthened these objectives
were given priorities. Also the existing
programmes were redefined and many new
programmes launched to meet the goal.
Schemes under national rural employment
guarantee act (NAREGA) that mainly helped
creation of rural employment and rural assets
was extended to 330 districts more. Agricultural
development under the government
programmes like Accelerated Irrigation Benefits,
Bharat Nirman, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna
and National Rainfed Area Authority were
extended. National food security mission to
address the food crisis in India and especially
among rural poor was launched. Government
also launched national rural health mission
scheme to improve the country’s health
expenditure.
<br>
<br>
The economic development for the eleventh
plan was based on series of model of the
economy. A broad framework which
represented an indicative planning was
prepared. Under this different growth targets
for different sectors were fixed to achieve overall
9 per cent annual growth rate for the GDP.
There was an increase in investment and saving
target though the increased planned for
achievement was modest with ICOR remaining
more or less the same. However in quantitative
terms even the same amount of ICOR (capital
output ratio) amounted to a substantial
amount. Agricultural growth target was fixed
at 4 per cent, industry at 10-11 per cent and
services at 9-11 percent.
<br>
<br>
Among the industrial growth core sector
growth formed the basis of the industrial
growth model. This was likely to be achieved
with an increase in overall investment to 37-38
per cent on average throughout the plan period.
The major structural change in the investment
pattern was decrease in share of the public
investment in total investment. The private
sector investment now accounts for almost 77
per cent in total investment in the economy.
Competitive environment was sought to be
increased by policy enactment such that the
market mechanism to would play dominant
role in reaching equilibrium, also the
government role was reduced to minimum.
This was furthered by reducing quantitative
and qualitative restrictions both for internal
private investors and external investors to boost
economic growth. Infrastructural development
however was left for the public sector
investment as government increased its
investment in agriculture, irrigation and water
management. Thus public sector investment
was targeted to increase from 4.1 per cent in
2006–07 to 6.8 per cent in 2011–12.
The increased investment is projected to be
most likely to be funded by increasing
equivalent increase in savings. Further stress is
put on the increase in domestic savings.
Whereas the main factors identified for
increasing the domestic savings was household
savings and corporate savings, the public sector
savings played lesser role in it. Though during
the seventh plan the public sector savings
improved as compared to previous plan on
account of the impact of the Fifth Pay
Commission’s recommendations worked itself
out in the system, the implementation of the
Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
(FRBM) Act, and the fiscal and revenue deficit
targets for 2008–09 established thereby helped
introduce an element of discipline, and the
buoyancy in tax revenues arising out of the
high growth rate recorded in the Tenth Plan
combined with improvements in tax
administration contributed to improved savings.
<br>
<br>
Apart from internal savings and investment
identity policies to balance of payment from
external account were also unveiled. In the
globalised market where the financial system
was complicated the role of external factors
are important. Thus a series of policies were
announced to help the economy not only
integrate with globalized market but also avail
the opportunities from it. The merchandise
trade was further liberalized by reducing the
quantitative and qualitative restrictions. Also
many new export promoting incentives were
announced. To increase both foreign direct
investment that were long term and
institutional investment that are short term the
government reformed its financial and capital
markets. For example apart from allowing 51
percent FDI in most of the sectors appropriate
special economic zone policies conducive for
direct investment were also enacted during this
plan. Direct investment in many of the sectors
now flow through automatic route.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>APPROACH PAPER TO THE
TWELFTH PLAN (2012-2017)</i></strong></div>

Indian planning has travelled a long
distance since its inception in March 1950. The
planning has been a mixed experience. On the
one hand India has overcome the bottlenecks
existing in the form of low saving, low
investment, food scarcity, etc. On the other still
Indian economy ‘tryst with destiny’ is far from
true realization as socio-economic and human
development indicators has been the biggest
obstacle for the realization of an egalitarian
society.
<br>
<br>
So far eleven plans have been formulated
and implemented. The approach paper to the
12th Plan has been approved by the Cabinet in
September. It would be prudent to analyse the
performance of the Eleventh Plan as given by
the Mid-Term Appraisal of the 11th Plan in
brief and then the issues that has been identified
by the 12th Plan that need to be overcome.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Eleventh Plan Performance</i></strong></div>

GDP growth for the 11th Plan is likely to
be 8.2%, which is less than the target of 9%,
but is a remarkable achievement given the worst
drought in 30 years and the global recession.
There has also been progress on various aspects
of inclusiveness, though the progress has been
less than what was targeted. Agricultural
growth has improved from 2% in the Tenth
Plan to 3%, but this is below the 4% target.
There has also been progress in poverty
reduction and in the areas of health, education
and in upliftment of SC/STs. However, trends
reveal that we are likely to miss the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) in several of the
targets, especially those relating to health.
Inflation has accelerated in the past two
years and is now an area of concern. The global
environment is also highly uncertain, both in
terms of the strength of recovery in the
developed countries and also the volatility in
commodity prices, especially oil. International
financial markets are yet to stabilize, and the
extraordinary easing of global money supply
has yet to play itself out.
<br>
<br>
Planning Commission has undertaken
extensive consultations with a wide range of
organizations and individuals, which reveals
that citizen groups support the broad objectives
of existing government programmes, but they
have little faith in the design of these
programmes and the manner of execution.
There is a perception that government
programmes, especially Centrally Sponsored
Schemes, are not sensitive enough to local
needs. Also, Government works in silos with
little effort to achieve convergence and coordination across Ministries and between
Centre and States, even though most problems
require inter-Governmental and interMinisterial co-ordination.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Twelfth Plan Objectives</i></strong></div>

The basic objective for the Twelfth Plan must
be faster, more inclusive and sustainable
growth.
<br>
<br>
A key issue is what the Growth target
should be. The target of 10% is being mentioned,
but assessment of the 11th Plan and uncertain
global environment indicates that even 9% will
be difficult to achieve. In the short to medium
run, the main constraints relate to insufficient
agricultural growth leading to inflation,
growing skill shortages, and the unsettled global
economy. In the longer run, the environment
and natural resources, particularly energy and
water, pose serious challenges. Therefore 12TH
Plan has proposed a target range of GDP
growth of 9 to 9.5%.
<br>
<br>
An inclusive growth strategy is essential to
address some of the main growth constraints
outlined above, and to make the target growth
rate feasible. The following are the key
instruments for making growth more inclusive:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Better performance in agriculture (at least
4% growth).</li>
            <li>Faster creation of jobs in manufacturing
through spreading industrial growth more
widely.</li>
            <li>Both agricultural and manufacturing
growth will depend upon the creation of
appropriate infrastructural facilities in a
widely dispersed manner. Rural
connectivity is particularly important in this
regard, especially in the backward areas
and the north-east.</li>
            <li>There must be a much stronger effort at
health, education and skill development.</li>
            <li>Reforming the implementation of flagship
programmes to increase their effectiveness
in achieving the objective of greater
inclusion.</li>
            <li>Special challenges focused by vulnerable
groups and backward regions. The need
for a special focus on backward regions has
particularly become urgent.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Agriculture and Rural Development</i></strong></div>    

Moving forward on the estimated
agriculture growth of 3-3.2% in the 11th Plan,
12th Plan has aimed a target of 4% agricultural
growth. It is further estimated that cereals will
grow only at 1.5 to 2.0%. However, other food
(horticulture, dairying, fisheries etc.) need to
grow at more than 5%. This calls for a change
in agricultural strategy as these are all
perishable products, and therefore subject to
much higher degree of market risk than 
foodgrains, oil seeds or natural fibres. In the case of
these products, which are all relatively high
value, investments and institutional
development are more important than subsidies
or price support systems.
<br>
<br>
In order to achieve the agriculture growth
of 4% 12th Plan has emphasized on raising
land productivity and water use efficiency.
State specific strategies are emphasised. Dry
areas need to focus on livestock. Most
importantly, markets must be reformed. An
important beginning has been made by granting
statutory status to warehouse receipts.
However, the real benefits from this measure
can accrue only when the appropriate
warehouse infrastructure and supporting
backward linkages have been created and a
nationwide trading platform has been put in
place. Consideration should be given to
extending infrastructure status to a wider range
of agricultural market facilities in the same
manner as for warehouses. States must modify
the Essential Commodities Act (ECA) and the
APMC Act (perhaps exclude horticulture and
perishables entirely from the ambit of APMC),
rebuild the extension system, increase the
involvement of private sector in marketing, and
also facilitate leasing in/out of land by farmers.
State agricultural universities and extension
networks are in a bad shape and need
strengthening.
<br>
<br>
<b>MGNREGS</b> has helped generate
employment and income in rural areas but it
can do much more to increase land productivity,
particularly in rainfed areas. This calls for
redesign of the programme in the Twelfth Plan.
In addition, MGNREGA has transformed rural
labour relations, which is bound to affect the
production decisions of farmers, both in terms
of crops as well as technologies. The
Agricultural support systems must facilitate this
transition, which requires greater flexibility and
responsiveness. Forest economies and tribal
societies need greater protection and promotion.
Steps need to be taken to make PESA and FRA
more effective. This can be in conjunction with
schemes for increasing resources directed to the
backward regions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Water</i></strong></div>

Water is emerging as a major problem, both
for drinking as well as for irrigation. Urban
and industrial demand for water is going up
rapidly, without commensurate augmentation
of supply. To address this critical problem,
need is to put an integrated strategy in place
immediately. The elements of this strategy
could be:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Re-estimate India’s water balance basinwise. All aquifers must be mapped over
the next five years and aquifer management
plans put in place.</li>
        <li>AIBP must be restructured to incentivize
irrigation reform and efficiency of water
use. Setting up Water Regulatory Authority
should be made a precondition for AIBP
approvals. Some States are already doing
this.</li>
        <li>Watershed management must be given
higher priority, with convergence of
programmes and better technical support.</li>
        <li>Separation of electrical feeders for
agriculture with high-quality assured, even
if rationed, power supply can potentially
reduce ground water use.</li>
        <li>Water recycling in urban areas and by
industries should be enforced to protect
water levels and water quality in both
surface and ground water sources.</li>
        <li>The legal and policy framework needs to
be improved. In this direction 12th Plan
has considered promulgating a new
Groundwater Law reflecting the principles
of Public Trust Doctrine, and a new Water
Framework Law along the lines of the one
that exists in the European Union.</li>
        <li>A National Water Commission may be put
in place to monitor compliance with
conditionalities imposed in clearance of
important projects.</li>
        <li>Since water is primarily a State subject, we
will need to evolve a political consensus
along the lines of what was done in the
case of power. Perhaps a special National
Development Council meeting could be
convened for this purpose.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

Manufacturing performance is weak.
Growth of manufacturing in the 11thPlan is
likely to be only 8%. We need to raise this to
11-12% per year in the 12th Plan to create the
jobs for our growing labour force. This has
become a particularly urgent need since it is
now clear that agriculture will no longer absorb
more workers, and may indeed release some of
the existing work-force. As per the 12th Plan
estimation, the manufacturing sector will have
to create around 3 to 4 million jobs over and
above the pace of job creation in the recent
past.
<br>
<br>
To achieve the desired growth in
manufacturing 12th Plan emphasizes on
effectively harnessing the abundance of
abundance of entrepreneurial talent in the
country. The corporate sector has largely been
unfettered, and has demonstrated its
dynamism. There are, however, limits to which
it can grow. A large part of the additional
growth will have to come from the MSME
sector, which continues to face a plethora of
hurdles in realizing its true potential. The
Twelfth Plan will need to focus on this.
For accelerating manufacturing growth,
therefore, we need a strategy to:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Achieve greater domestic value addition
and technological depth in Indian industry
to cater to growing domestic demand and
to improve our trade position.</li>
            <li>Attract investment, including FDI, in
critical areas where manufacturing capacity
should modernised and developed.</li>
            <li>Improve the business environment and
reduce the cost of doing business. This is
largely an agenda item for state
governments. (Procedural wrangles and
corruption affect small business the most).</li>
            <li>Land and infrastructure constraints must
be addressed effectively. Again, this is
largely in the domain of the State, but the
Centre can incentivise.</li>
            <li>Promoting “clusters” is a very effective way
of helping manufacturing and promoting
MSMEs. State Governments should be
incentivized to support clusters.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Education</i></strong></div>

Education has received less funds in the
Eleventh Plan than was envisaged. This is partly
because the sector made a slow start, but also
because of resource constraints. The Twelfth
Plan has to correct this.
<br>
<br>
Eleventh Plan focused on quantity in school
expansion. In this regard significant success has
been recorded with enrolment rates going up
rapidly, especially in primary education.
However, scholastic achievement tests show
that learning achievements of the students are
well below desired levels. Twelfth Plan must
focus on quality. This includes teacher training
and evaluation, and also measures to enforce
accountability.
<br>
<br>
There is need to rapidly build capacity in
secondary schools to absorb the graduates from
expanded primary enrolments. States must
facilitate PPP in secondary education. States
are keen to do this, and Planning Commission
is collaborating with them on this. The dropout rates between primary and secondary
education continue to be extremely high, which
raises questions regarding the perceptions of
the utility of secondary education among the
people. This will need to be changed through
introducing higher skill content at the secondary
schools level. Vocational education will need
to be given greater emphasis and made more
attractive.
<br>
<br>
The gross enrolment ratio (GER) in higher
education must be targeted to increase from
nearly 18% today to say 25% by 2016-17 and
perhaps 30% by 2020. Private universities and
colleges have played a major role in increasing
enrolment in higher education in recent years,
but there are concerns regarding both equity
and quality. Measures will need to be taken to
further promote private initiatives in higher
education while addressing the concerns that
have arisen. Skill Development needs a major
focus at all levels. To ensure that the skills
developed also lead to employability, the
emphasis in the Approach Paper is on
promoting PPP.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Health</i></strong></div>

The quality of health services needs to be
improved through NRHM. Besides, the need is
to focus on preventive aspects of health care,
particularly drinking water, sanitation,
nutrition, better maternal and child services and
immunisation.
Shortage of qualified medical personnel at
all levels is a major hurdle in improving the
outreach of the healthcare system, especially
the public health facilities. This needs to be
corrected expeditiously. Efforts are already
underway to increase the out-turn of doctors.
This will have to be accelerated, and similar
efforts have to be put in place for nurses and
medical technicians. However, such efforts will
take time to have sufficient impact. In the
meanwhile, systems will need to be put in place
for more effective PPP models in primary health
care.
<br>
<br>
Role of PPP in secondary and tertiary health
care must be explored with greater vigour.
Planning Commission needs to evolve
appropriate concession models to facilitate this.
Planning Commission is in touch with states to
study their experiments, and best practices will
need to be propagated in the country.
Expenditure on health by the Centre and
States needs to be increased from 1.3 percent
of GDP at present to 2.0 percent (and perhaps
even 2.5 percent) by the end of 12th Plan.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Energy</i></strong></div>

GDP growth of 9% requires commercial
energy growth of 7%. The likely achievement
in 11th Plan is 5.5%. Unless adequate growth
in commercial energy availability is ensured the
GDP growth target cannot be achieved.
The following policy issues have to be
addressed.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The need to create 100,000 MW of new
power capacity in the Twelfth Plan. The
ability to do so is seriously undermined by
persisting large losses in the discoms,
estimated at Rs.70, 000 crore per year. These
losses are being sustained only because
banks continue to lend to what are
effectively bankrupt discoms. State
Governments have to be incentivised to
implement distribution reforms which
reduce ATC losses. Some states are
succeeding but in general the progress is
too slow. Better performing states should
be rewarded.</li>
        <li>Forest and environment clearance
procedures are hindering both coal
availability and hydro-power development.
State governments with coal and hydro
resources have been complaining strongly
about the costs being borne by them.</li>
        <li>The implementation of past policy initiatives
is incomplete. Prices of electricity are not
sufficiently flexible and regulators are being
restrained from allowing periodic price
increases. Open access is still not a reality,
and needs to be incentivized.</li>
        <li>At present, petroleum, gas and coal prices
all three are out of line with world prices
and world energy prices are unlikely to
soften. Domestic prices need to be better
aligned to give the right signals to both
consumers and investors. The need is to
adopt a time-bound programme to achieve
this alignment over three years.</li>
        <li>Coal production will be a major constraint
partly due to weak performance of Coal
India and partly environmental constraints.
Because coal production cannot be
increased sufficiently, we must plan now
for coal imports to rise from 80 million
tonnes to 250 million tonnes by the end of
the 12th Plan. This will require
corresponding expansion of rail and port
capacity.</li>
        <li>Coal India must become a coal supplier and
not just a mining company. It should plan
to import coal and carry out price pooling
and blending to meet the needs of the users.</li>
        <li>In the petroleum and natural gas sector,
need is to further expansion of new NELP
blocks and a clear policy for exploration of
shale gas, integrated development of oil and
gas blocks. Bidding in various oil
exploration rounds in the past has not
attracted oil majors. Term of PSCs should
perhaps be clear to attract investment. This
is an area where foreign participation in
exploration also brings in up-to-date
technology.</li>
        <li>Nuclear power programme must continue,
with necessary safety review. Active efforts
need to be made to allay the apprehensions
of people regarding the safety of nuclear
power plants.</li>
        <li>Solar mission is seriously underfunded and
requires more support. It is also not clear
whether the current bidding process is
sufficiently competitive and provides
appropriate incentives for improving
efficiency. Wind power too requires greater
support, especially for off-shore locations
which have not been sufficiently explored.</li>
        <li>Demand side management of energy is as
important as action on the supply side.
Realistic pricing will help. However, we
also need more pro-active standard setting
for appliances, vehicles and buildings.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Transport</i></strong></div>

GDP growth at 9% or more will need to be
supported by much faster expansion in
transport infrastructure than we have seen in
the past. The requirements of energy efficiency
also require a shift from road to rail in freight.
The following are some of the important
issues that arise:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Dedicated Freight Corridor project is a
major capacity enhancing investment for
the Railways. It must be put on a monitoring
system such that both corridors are
completed before the end of the Twelfth
Plan. For this purpose, milestone must be
clearly fixed, and responsibility assigned.</li>
        <li>The Railways have to undertake an
ambitious programme of modernisation and
technical upgradation which increases their
freight carrying capacity. Unless this is done
they will not be capable of facilitating the
shift from road to rail transport which is
crucial for energy efficiency. This can only
be achieved if (a) the Railways desist from
diverting resources to gauge conversion and
uneconomic passenger lines and (b)
Railways financing is improved to be able
to support medium term expansion.</li>
        <li>Improved Railway financing requires
rationalisation of freight: passenger fares in
the Railways. If this is not done, the
Railways will simply not achieve financial
viability.</li>
        <li>The Railways must move speedily to
implement the PPP projects that are
pending in diesel and electric locomotives.</li>
        <li>Rail and road linkages to ports must have
top priority.</li>
        <li>The NHAI programme needs to be put on
a track where monitorable milestones
targets are set for the 12th Plan with
maximum emphasis on viable BOT projects
to reduce the demand for Government
resources.</li>
        <li>The port expansion programme has been
seriously delayed. PPP in ports should be
exploited. Much more needs to be done to
deepen ports.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Plan Size and Resources</i></strong></div>

In this regard, as in the past, a Working
Group has been set up under the Chairmanship
of the Chief Economic Adviser. The size will
depend upon:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the buoyancy in revenues</li>
        <li>the tolerable level of the fiscal deficit</li>
        <li>the extent to which we can control 
            non-Plan expenditure including subsidies.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

A tentative picture available at present
suggests that the Centre’s GBS could increase
from 4.9% of GDP in 2011-12 to 6.2% of GDP
in 2016-17. Most of this increase will be in the
last two years of the Plan since in the first three
years the fiscal deficit will have to be
compressed from 4.6% in 2011-12 (the base
year) to 4.1%, 3.5% and finally 3.0% in
2014-15.
<br>
<br>
A key assumption affecting the resource
projection is that non-Plan expenditure growth
can be contained below GDP growth. The
absence of a Pay Commission in this period
will help. However, critical to this projection is
the assumption that subsidies will grow by only
5% per year. It may be difficult to contain food
subsidy within that limit, depending on the
outcome of the Food Security Act. However,
strong action will be needed in containing
fertiliser subsidy and petroleum subsidies.
Allocation Priorities in the 12th Plan
The increase in the GBS as a percentage of
GDP between 2011-12 and 2017-18 is therefore
only 1.3 percentage point. However, the need
is to provide a significant increase for health,
education, and infrastructure as a percentage
of GDP.
<br>
<br>
Health and Education received only about
60% of the planned allocation in the 11th Plan
as against an over-all realization of 87%. This
was partly on account of major new schemes
being launched during the Plan and partly due
to limitations in the absorptive capacity in these
sectors. The preparatory work done during
the 11th Plan has led to significant improvement
in absorptive capacities, and these sectors both
require and are ready for significant increases
in allocations. It is estimated that the GBS
allocated to these two sectors, including skill
development initiatives, will need to be
increased by at least 1.2 percentage point of
GDP.
<br>
<br>
Infrastructure investments have seen
significant improvement during the 11th Plan,
but the pace of infrastructure development
needs further acceleration if the glaring
infrastructure gaps are to be bridged within a
reasonable time-frame. Although PPPs have
been successful in a number of infrastructure
sectors, and efforts will need to be continued
in further encouraging private sector
involvement, it is felt that public investment in
infrastructure, particularly irrigation, watershed
development and urban infrastructure, will
need an additional 0.7 percentage points of
GDP increase over the next five years.
These sectors will therefore need an increase
of 1.9 percentage points of GDP as GBS during
the 12th Plan. The GBS for the other sectors as
a percentage of GDP must therefore go down.
<br>
<br>
The allocation of these sectors will increase in
absolute terms, but more slowly than real GDP.
This reprioritisation must be accepted.
The above situation emphasises the
importance of resorting to PPP as much as
possible. This is particularly important in the
social sectors, where only tentative beginnings
have been made. Several states have initiated
interesting models of PPP in social service
delivery. These experiments need to be
evaluated and best practices up-scaled to the
national level.
<br>
<br>
The innovations made at the state level in
a range of sectors make a compelling reason
for reconsideration of the Centrally Sponsored
Schemes (CSS). The States have consistently
argued that the CSS are structured too rigidly
to permit innovations and to meet local
specificities. There is merit in this argument.
It is, therefore, proposed to reduce the number
of CSS to only a few major schemes which are
of a national character and dictated by the
rights and entitlements of citizens. For all the
rest, it is proposed to create flexi-funds in the
concerned Ministries which can be used to
support state-level innovations and/or upscaling of successful experiments. The success
of the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY),
which is in effect a flexi-fund scheme, as
compared to the other CSS lends further
credibility to this approach.
A compelling argument has also been made
regarding the lack of ownership of the CSS by
the States, and its consequent effect in terms of
poor implementation. It has been proposed
therefore that the model used in the new
APDRP should be extended to all other CSS as
well. In this model, central funds are initially
provided as loans to the state governments,
which are subsequently converted to grants on
achievement of pre-specified outcome or output
targets.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Governance and Empowerment</i></strong></div>

Citizen feedback reveals general
unhappiness with governance and public
service delivery. Four important dimensions
have been pointed out: (i) programmes and
schemes are often designed without adequate
understanding of the desires and limitations of
the beneficiaries, especially the most
disadvantaged; (ii) systems for informing the
people of their rights and entitlements are very
poor and often exclusionary; (iii) the service
delivery personnel, apart from issues of
corruption, are inadequately informed of their
duties and responsibilities and take little pride
in their work; and (iv) complaint redressal
systems are not independent of the delivery
mechanism resulting in non-responsive
behavior.
<br>
<br>
People should be active agents of change
and this can be achieved only if flagship
programmes provide human and financial
resources for social mobilization, capacity
building and an information strategy. The
involvement of civil society organizations
(CSOs) in programme design through wide
consultations should become a norm.
Delivery and policy functions, the latter
including concurrent evaluation, need to be
separated in Government Ministries in order
to introduce objectivity in programme design
and redesign. Consideration needs to be given
to setting up professionally managed delivery
organizations with clear mandates and
accountability.
<br>
<br>
Information dissemination methodologies
need to be entirely recast. The poorest and
most disadvantaged need to be targeted
specifically. It is also felt that women and the
youth are the most effective agents of change,
and advantage should be taken of organizations
which work closely with them to spread relevant
programme information through formal and
informal channels.
Total Quality Management needs to be
introduced at all levels in service delivery
organisations. Training of service delivery
personnel and periodic review of performance
are essential.
<br>
<br>
Complaint recording and redressal systems
have to be created at an arm’s length from the
delivery system, and these should be
empowered to enforce and monitor compliance.
Advantage can be taken of IT systems to
increase transparency and responsiveness.
Government departments engaged in
related areas tend to work in silos. The need is
for much better mechanism for converging the
activity of these departments. In many areas
there is need for effective mechanisms for
resolution of inter-Ministerial and interdepartmental differences. This is particularly
true in the field where the Collector is
potentially the only possible focus of
convergence but is actually far too overburdened.
