<h3>Public Finance In India</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PUBLIC FINANCE</i></strong></div>

It is that branch of economics that studies about
government finances. Government finances
have two main components-(1) Public Revenue
and (2) Public Expenditure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PUBLIC REVENUE</i></strong></div>

Public revenue refers to revenue of the government from tax and non-tax sources. There
are two broad sources of public revenue- Tax
and non-tax sources. Taxes are compulsory levies, 
which every citizen is legally obliged to pay
to the government. Taxes are broadly categorised
as direct and indirect taxes. The non-tax sources
of public revenue are mobilised from a variety of
sources. The non-tax sources include, among others, the surplus and profit generated in the commercial undertakings of the government, the savings and profits of the Public sector undertakings,
market borrowings, interest, repayment of principal by the debtors, the disinvestment proceeds
of Public sector undertakings, signoirage, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tax Base</i></strong></div>

Tax base refers to the base on which a tax
is levied. Some taxes are levied on income (income tax, corporate tax, profit tax, presumptive tax, etc.) whereas some other taxes are levied on commodity production and sale (excise
duty and sales tax). Taxes are also levied on
cross border transactions or movements of commodities (customs duty).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Direct and Indirect Taxes</i></strong></div>

All taxes have been broadly categorized as
direct and indirect taxes.
<br>
<br>
<b>Direct Taxes:</b> In the colloquial sense, a direct tax is one paid directly to the government
by the persons (juristic or natural) on whom it
is imposed (often accompanied by a tax return
filed by the taxpayer). Examples include some
income taxes, some corporate taxes, Property
Tax, Wealth Tax, Expenditure Tax and
transfertaxes such as estate (inheritance) tax and gift tax.
<br>
<b>Indirect Taxes :</b> An indirect tax or "collected" tax is one (such as excise duty, customs
duty, sales tax or value added tax or VAT)
which is collected by intermediaries who turn
over the proceeds to the government and file
the related tax return. Some examples of indirect taxes are-Excise Duty, Customs Duty, Sales
Tax, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact and Incidence of Taxes</i></strong></div>

The impact of a tax refers to the first point
of levy of a tax whereas the incidence of a tax
refers to the final resting point of a tax. Now,
the taxes in which the impact and incidence lie
at the same point are not shiftable, hence, they
are direct taxes. On the other hand taxes in
which impact of taxes is at one point and the
incidence is on another point, they are shiftable, hence, they are indirect taxes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Canons of a Good Tax</i></strong></div>

Adam Smith has prescribed four canons of a
good tax. They are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Canon of Equality: According to this canon,
taxes should be in proportion to the ability of tax payers of different economic
classes.</li>
        <li>Canon of Certainty: A good tax must be
certain and not arbitray in terms of time
and mode and manner of payment, the
rate of taxes to be paid, etc.</li>
        <li>Canon of Convenience: The mode and timing of tax payment should be convenient
to the tax payer.</li>
        <li>Canon of Economy: The cost of collection
of taxes should be minimum. Some more
canons of a good tax were added later by
public finance experts. The important
among them are:</li>
        <li>Canon of Productivity: It is called the
canon of fiscal adequacy as well. According to this canon, a tax must be able to
garner sufficient public revenue for the
treasury so that the government can avoid
deficit financing.</li>
        <li>Canon of Buoyancy: The tax revenue
should have an inherent tendency to increase along with the increase in national
income, even if the rates and coverage
are not revised.</li>
        <li>Canon of Flexibility: The taxes should be
flexible enough so that tax authorities can
revise the tax rate or its coverage or both
as per need of the hour.</li>
        <li>Canon of Simplicity: The taxes should be
simple to understand and administer.</li>
        <li>Canon of Diversity: A tax system should
permit diversity and variety of taxes rather
than relying on a few taxes.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Provisions to Levy and Collect
Taxes</i></strong></div>

The central and state governments need
funds to meet various socio-economic obligations. The constitution has clearly mentioned
about the powers of centre and the states with
regard to levy and collection of taxes. Among
the taxes levied and collected by the central
government the most important are the central
excise duty and customs duties, apart from
income and corporation taxes. But the centre is
required to share the proceeds of excise and
income taxes with the states. The state governments have the sole authority to levy taxes on
land and agriculture. There is provision of some
local taxes such as property taxes, octroi, profession tax, etc. that local bodies can levy.
Till 1st April 2005, every state had its own
sales tax syatem, wherein they levied and collected it with their own machinery. From 1st
April onwards, 21 states have shifted to a system of unified VAT.
The Union taxes as laid down in List-I of
the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution are
as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Taxes on income and other than agricultural income;</li>
        <li>Corporation tax;</li>

        <li>Taxes on railway freight and fares;</li>
        <li>Terminal taxes on goods or passengers carried by railways, sea or air</li>
        <li>Taxes on the sale and purchase of goods
in the case of interstate trade.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

 The taxes under State List as given in the
List- II of the Seventh Schedule of Indian Constitution are as follows:
<ol>

power to impose taxes, which are not specifically 
mentioned in the State or Concurrent List.</li>
        <li>The property of the Union is exempted
from state taxation and the property and
income of the states are exempt from
Union taxes.</li>
        <li>The Parliament may pass legislation for
taxation by the Union of any trading or
business activities of a state, which are not
part of the ordinary functions of the Government.</li>
        <li>States may delegate part of their taxation
powers to the central government. The provision 
has been applied in the case of agricultural land, which has been included
in the purview of Estate duties in many
states.</li>
        <li>Parliament has exclusive powers to tax
sales or purchases of goods in the course
of the inter-state trade.</li>
        <li>In view of increased role of state governments and limited sources of revenue, the
Constitution of India has provided for the
devolution of resources from the Center
to the States.</li>
        <li>For devolution of certain central taxes' proceeds to the states, 
the Article 280 of Indian Constitution provides for the setting
up of a Finance Commission by the President every five years or earlier.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEW TAXES IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Fringe Benefit Tax</i></strong></div>

The Budget 2005-06 has imposed what it calls
a 'fringe benefit' tax on certain expenses incurred
by corporates. These expenses are deemed to be
in the nature of fringe benefits extended to employees. The specified expenses when incurred
on employees are 'deemed' to be 'fringe benefits,'
and hence, attract a tax even though the employee may not derive any benefit from it. The
budget 2005-06 contains the definition of 'fringe
benefits' as "any privilege, service, facility or
amenity, directly or indirectly, provided by an
employer to his employees (including former
employee or employees) by reason of their employment; or any reimbursement, directly or indirectly, made by the employer to his employees
for any purpose; any free or concessional ticket
provided by the employer for private journeys of
the employees and their family members; and
any contribution by the employer to an approved
superannuation fund. Some of the most common fringe benefits include car, computer services, hotel and tour expenses, etc. which generally becomes a fringe benefit when it is owned or
leased by an employer and made available for
the private use of an employee. This tax was
scrapped in the budget 2009-10.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Banking Cash Transaction Tax</i></strong></div>

The budget 2005-06 has introduced a tax on
cash withdrawal from banks, called
Banking Cash Transaction Tax or Banking Cash
Withdrawal Tax. The new banking cash transaction tax, introduced for the first time in the
Indian Budget was meant to keep a tax trail on
blackmoney.The savings accounts were totally
exempted from 0.1 per cent tax on cash withdrawal from banks following criticism
from trade, industry and political parties.The tax
was applicable for withdrawals of Rs 25,000 and
above on a single day from current and other
non-savings accounts in the banks for
individuals and Hindu Undivided Families.
For business accounts, the 0.1 per cent tax was
applicable for any withdrawal beyond Rs 1 lakh
on a single day. The central board of direct taxes
through a notification in this regard (June 1, 1996, made it clear that 
if the total withdrawal exceeds Rs 25,000 by individuals or Rs 1 lakh by
businesses on a single day even through multi
transactions, the tax would be effective. Originally 
proposed to levy transaction tax of Rs 10,000
and above, Finance Minister P. Chidambaram
later scaled up the limit to Rs 25,000 after it
evoked wide-spread criticism from industry and
political parties. The budget 2008-09 announced
that Banking Cash Transaction Tax (BCTT)
would be withdrawn with effect from April 1,
2009.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT)</i></strong></div>

In almost all the economies of the world,
income tax laws provide a number of concessions in their income tax laws. A profit making clever company may conduct its business
and accounting affairs in such a manner that the
cumulative effect of all such concessions is
to reduce its income declared in the tax returns
to zero. The Minimum Alternate Tax is a
device to keep a zero tax company within the
tax net.
<br>
<br>
In the 1996-97 budgets, an effort was made
to tackle the phenomenon of zero tax companies, which despite having substantial book
profits paid zero tax. The government brought
the zero tax companies under the tax net. Thus,
where the total income of a company after
availing all eligible deductions was less than 30
per cent of the book profit, the total income of
such companies was deemed to be 30 per cent
of the book profit and they were charged a
minimum tax which works out to be 12 per
cent of the book profit. Some sectors such as
power, infrastructure and exports were exempt
from the MAT.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Value-Added Tax (VAT) and GST</i></strong></div>

VAT (Value Added Tax) was introduced to
avoid cascading of taxes (tax being levied upon
a price that includes one or more elements of
tax) as a product passes through different
stages of production/value addition. The tax is
based on the difference between the value of
the output and the value of the inputs used to
produce it. The aim is to tax a firm only for the
value added by it to the inputs it is using for
manufacturing its output and not the entire
input cost. VAT brings in transparency to commodity taxation: right now, only the final tax
paid by the consumer is apparent to her, while
with value added tax generalised to a goods
and services tax (GST) that subsumes both central and state level taxation, the entire element
of tax borne by a good (or a service) would be
represented by the GST paid on it. A GST of
20% might seem high, but it would be about
half the actual incidence of tax in most goods
at present.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CENVAT</i></strong></div>

Central value Added Tax is the rechristened
MODVAT. The Government introduced
CENVAT in lieu of central excise taxes in 2000-
01 budget and it plans to extend the CENVAT
to the customs duties in due course. Initially
the CENVAT was introduced as an experiment
on a limited basis, but later it was extended to
all sectors of the economy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>State VAT</i></strong></div>

State level VAT became operational from April
1, 2005 to replace sales tax that varied over
states. Now we have a harmonized system of
state VAT. Here are some the main features of
state VAT.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Introduction of VAT would help avoid cascading nature of sales tax.</li>
        <li>Present multiple rates and taxes can converge into a few rates and a single VAT.</li>
        <li>Transparency in the system of tax administration through simple self-assessments
and departmental audit.</li>
        <li>Rationalisation of taxes to result in lower
tax burden and higher tax revenues.</li>
        <li>To avoid tax competition, the design of
State VAT needs to be harmonized even
as the distinctive needs of individual States
are recognized.</li>
        <li>State VAT to have two basic rates of 4 per
cent and 12.5 per cent and to cover 550
commodities. About 270 commodities will
be under 4 per cent rate.</li>
        <li>46 items, comprising of natural and unproc-
essed products in unorganized sector, items
legally barred from taxation and items having social implications, are exempt from
VAT.</li>
        <li>Gold and silver ornaments subject to a special 
            VAT rate of 1 per cent and other commodities to attract a general VAT rate of
12.5 per cent.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Finance Bill</i></strong></div>

The proposals of government for levy of new
taxes, modification of the existing tax structure
or continuance of the existing tax structure beyond the period approved by Parliament are
submitted to Parliament through this bill. It is
the key document as far as taxes are concerned.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Budget</i></strong></div>

Budget (from originating from french word
'bougette') generally refers to a list of all planned
expenses and revenues of government. An annual proposal that outlines anticipated Federal
revenue and designates program expenditures for
the upcoming fiscal year. Thus budget is a statement of the State's program plan, the resources
necessary to support that plan, a description of
how and for what purposes the resources are to
be used, and a projection of the effects of the
programs on people and the environment. The
Union Budget is the annual report of India as a
country. It contains the government of India's
revenue and expenditure for the end of a particular fiscal year, which runs from April 1 to
March 31. The Union Budget is the most extensive account of the government's finances, in
which revenues from all sources and expenses of
all activities undertaken are aggregated.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fiscal Year</i></strong></div>

A fiscal year (or financial year, or sometimes
budget year) is a period used for calculating
annual ("yearly") financial statements in businesses and other organizations. In many jurisdictions, regulatory laws regarding accounting
and taxation require such reports once per
twelve months, but do not require that the
period reported on constitutes a calendar year
(i.e., January through December). Fiscal years
vary between businesses and countries. In New
Zealand, India, Hong Kong, the government's
financial year runs from April 1 to March
31.The U.S. government's fiscal year begins on
October 1 of the previous calendar year and
ends on September 30 of the year with which
it is numbered. The Australian government's
fiscal year begins on July 1 and concludes on
June 30 of the following year.The United
Kingdom's fiscal year runs from April 6 to April
5. Japan's income tax year runs from January
1 to December 31, but corporate tax is charged
by their own one year period.
Performance and Programme Budgeting System
Programme Budgeting: The formulation of
the budget proposals should be directly related
to the extent to which they can be implemented. The implementation of a budget involves
making programmes, setting agencies that will
implement it and the modus operandi for the
same.
<br>
<br>
Performance Based Budgeting (PBB): Tests
have been devised for comparing actual with
the expected results and thereby assessing the
efficiency of the project in terms of its performance. This aspect of budgeting is referred to
as the performance budgeting. Performance
budget, as stated by the Hoover Commission
(USA), is based upon activities, functions and
projects of the government.
<br>
Performance and Programme Budgeting System (PPBS): A budget, which includes both the
aspects of budgeting viz. programme budgeting and
performance budgeting may be termed Performance
and Programme Budgeting System (PPBS).
The PPBS is an outcome of efforts aimed at
improving the formulation and execution of
expenditure policy of the government at the
executors (not legislative) level. It incorporates
rules of managerial efficiency and flexibility in
both formulation and execution of expenditure
policy of the government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Revenue and Capital Budgets</i></strong></div>

A budget has two accounts, namely, (1) revenue account and (2) capital account. Revenue
account includes all receipts and expenditure,
which are of recurring nature and which do
not pertain to sale and purchase of assets. The
capital account includes the heads which pertain to receipts and expenditures of long term
nature and sale and purchase of assets. The
former is often called revenue budget whereas
the latter is called capital budget.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Revenue Budget</i></strong></div>

Revenue accounts cover those items, which
are of recurring nature. Current expenses are
equivalent to consumption. Revenue Budget consists of the revenue receipts - both tax - revenue
and non - tax revenue and revenue expenditure.
The tax revenue includes revenue form direct and
indirect taxes. The non-tax revenue receipts include revenue from currency, Coinage and mint,
interest receipts, dividends, profits, revenue from
general services (such as police, jails, supplies and
disposal, and public works), revenue from social
and community services (such as education,
health, housing, broadcasting and so on) and
revenue from other services (such as agriculture
and allied services, industry and mines, transport and communications).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Capital Budget (or Capital Account)</i></strong></div>

Capital Budget or Capital Account of the
budget covers those items, which are in the
nature of acquiring and disposing of capital
assets. Capital budget includes capital receipts
and capital disbursements. Capital account receipts include market loans, borrowings from
Reserve Bank of India and others through the
sale of treasury bills and loans from foreign
governments and others to the central government. Capital disbursements would include expenditure on acquisition of various physical
assets like land, buildings, machinery and equipment, investments in shares and debentures
and loans to state governments and other bodies. The capital budget also incorporates the
transactions in the Public Account.
The division between revenue and capital
account for state budgets is similar to that of
the government of India. In India, till mid 1980s,
in addition to the division of the budget into
Revenue and Capital Accounts, the Plan Budget was also prepared.
The Plan Budget was a document, which
showed the budgetary provisions for important
projects, programs and schemes included in the
central plan. It gave the details of the budgetary support for the Central Plan by sectors of
development, including the central plan assistance for States and Union Territories. The
break-up of the proposed outlays between General Services, Social and Community Services
and Economic Services was shown together
with various physical targets wherever possible.
Plan and Non-Plan Budget: Currently, in
pursuance of the recommendations of the Auditor and Comptroller General of India, the
previous practice of dividing budget into revenue account, capital account and plan budget
stands modified. Now the budget is first split
up into plan and non-plan parts and within
each part, there is a further division between
Revenue and capital accounts.
<br>
<br>
In the new classification, the expenditures
are categorized as plan expenditure and nonplan expenditures.
Plan expenditure covers only that portion of
the total expenditure, which is directed to
finance the schemes specifically initiated under
the given plan or which are the spillover of the
previous plan (s). The non-plan expenditure
includes such expenditures, which are done on
the maintenance of completed projects and
other running expenditure of government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB)</i></strong></div>

Zero based budgeting is an extension of corporate principles to the arena of public budgeting. The main objective behind zero based budgeting is to achieve efficiency in the budgetary
process by minimising wasteful expenditure
and maximising the outcomes. In a wider sense,
the ZBB is a means to convert a programme
buget into an essentially performance budget.
In the sphere of public budgeting, ZBB was
first tried by Mr. Jimmy Carter, Governor of
Georgia in 1973. Gradually zero based budgeting was given a trial in other states of the USA.
In zero based budgeting each item of expenditure going to various segments of an industrial/manufacturing activity would have to be
justified against its actual performance (vis-àvis target) and achievement. If a segment/section is not able to justify its own existence, it
would be closed down. And if its existence is
justified, the optimum levels of its operations
and the corresponding budgetary provisions
have also to be defended. ZBB refers to budgeting process where every section (item of expenditure) has to justify its worth against the
expenditure it claims. In other words justification as to why money should be spent on a
particular head has to be proved by the
spender. Every time, this exercise has to start
ab initio. An effective adoption of ZBB needs a
lot of understanding and detailed working out
of different levels. The main hurdles, apart from
lack of data are firstly that ZBB may prove
more expensive for it needs elaborate study and
secondly no department would like to recommend its own closure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PUBLIC EXPENDITURE</i></strong></div>

Public expenditure refers to government
expenditure. Public expenditure has been
increasing all over the world due to increased
involvement of governments in development
and welfare activities. It is classified as
follows:
<b>Plan Expenditure</b>:
This is essentially the Budget support to the
central plan and the central assistance to state
plans like all Budget heads, this is also split
into revenue and capital components.
<br>
<b>Non-plan Expenditure</b>:
This is largely the revenue expenditure of
the government. The biggest items of expenditure are interest payments, subsidies, salaries,
defence and pension. The capital component
of the non-plan expenditure is relatively small
with the largest allocation going to defence. It
is important to note that the entire defence expenditure is non-plan expenditure.
<br>
<b>Deficit Financing</b>:
Deficit financing means an excess of public
expenditure over public revenue. This excess
may be met by sale of public assets, borrowings from the domestic market, borrowings from
abroad, or drawing down of cash balances of
GOI or the issue (print) of fresh money by the
Central Bank.
<br>
<b>Fiscal Deficit</b>:
When the government's non-borrowed
receipts (revenue receipts plus loan repayments
received by the government plus miscellaneous
capital receipts, primarily disinvestment
proceeds) fall short of its entire expenditure, it
has to borrow money from the public to meet
the shortfall. The excess of total expenditure
over total nonborrowed receipts is called the
fiscal deficit.
<br>
<b>Primary Deficit</b>:
The revenue expenditure includes interest
payments on government's earlier borrowings.
The primary deficit is the fiscal deficit less interest payments. A shrinking primary deficit
would indicate progress towards fiscal health.
We had already discussed revenue deficit earlier. The Budget document also mentions the
deficit as a percentage of the GDP. This is to
facilitate comparison and also get a proper
perspective. In absolute terms, the fiscal deficit
may be large, but if it is small compared to the
size of the economy then it is not such a bad
thing. Prudent fiscal management requires that
government does not borrow to consume, in
the normal course. That brings us to the FRBM
Act.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Various Kinds of Deficits</i></strong></div>

1. Budget Deficit = Deficit on Revenue
Account plus Deficit on Capital Account.
<br>
2. Revenue Deficit = Deficit on Revenue Account
<br>
That is Revenue Expenditure - Revenue
Receipt. (Rev. Exp.> Rev. Rec.)
This deficit is an indicator of government's
imprudent consumption.
<br>
3. Fiscal Deficit = Budget Deficit + Otherliabilities = Budget Deficit plus borrowings
from internal market other than 91-day
ad-hoc treasury bills + External borrowing = Budget Deficit + Borrowing through
treasury bills (other than 91-day) + Borrowing from Small Savings + Borrowing
from provident fund + other borrowings
including external.
<br>
4. Monetised Deficit = Net increase in borrowing from RBI in a fiscal year.
<br>
5. Primary Deficit = Fiscal Deficit - Interest
payment.
<br>
Since 91 day ad-hoc treasury bills are not
issued since 1997, the concept of budget deficit
has been stopped to be used to gauge the fiscal
health of the country. Monetised deficit is also
not calculated now because the FRBM Act has
prohibited government borrowings from the
RBI for budgetary purposes. Instead there is a
provision for ways and means advance through
which governments at state or central levels
may borrow for their temporary revenue shortfalls for duration of 15-90 days.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fiscal Policy</i></strong></div>

Fiscal policy refers to the policy related to
revenue and expenditure of the government with
a view to correcting the situations of excess
demand or deficient demand in the economy.
The instruments of fiscal policy are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Fiscal Instruments Related to
Government Expenditure: The
government of a country incurs various
types of expenditure such as expenditure
on public works (construction of roads,
dams, bridges etc), education and public
welfare, defence, maintenance of law and
order, various types of subsidies, and
transfer payments to the public.
Government corrects the situations of
excess demand or deficient demand in the
economy by varying any or all types of
expenditure.</li>
        <li>Fiscal Instruments Related to Financing
of Government Expenditure: Taxation,
public debt and deficit financing are the
three fiscal instruments related to
financing of government expenditure.
Government can correct the situations of
excess demand or deficient demand in the
economy by using above mentioned
instruments.</li>
        <li>Fiscal Policy and Deficient Demand
Following fiscal measures to correct the
situation of deficient demand:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Decrease in Taxes: Government decreases
taxes, which leaves the households with
more purchasing power and the firms
with more cash reserves. Direct taxes like
income tax, corporation tax etc are
reduced. As a result both households as
well as investors will be encouraged to
spend more. Consequently, demand will
increase.</li>
        <li>Increase in Public Expenditure: To
stimulate the demand the government
increases expenditure over public health,
education, subsidies and transfer
payments, and public works. Public
expenditure causes the level of income to
increase in economy. Higher level of
income causes high level of demand.</li>
        <li>Increase Deficit financing: Deficit
financing (by way of printing more notes
for additional expenditure) is increased
during times of deficient demand so that
the overall level of purchasing power is
enhanced in the economy.</li>
        <li>Public Borrowing: Public borrowing is
reduced so that people are left with
greater disposable income.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Fiscal Policy and Excess Demand
Excess demand generates inflationary
pressures in the system. Following fiscal measures
are taken to correct the inflationary situation.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase in taxes: Tax rates are increased
progressively to mop up additional
purchasing power within the economy.</li>
        <li>Decrease in Government Expenditure:
Government expenditure is reduced so as
to cause the demand to decline.</li>
        <li>Reduce Deficit Financing: Deficit financing
is greatly restricted. The printing of more
notes would only increase the rate of
inflation.</li>
        <li>Public Borrowing: The situation demands
less purchasing power with the people.
So, the government takes resort to
increased public borrowing.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Main Objectives of Fiscal Policy in India
The fiscal policy is designed to achieve
certain objectives as follows:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Development by effective Mobilization
of Resources
The principal objective of fiscal policy is to
ensure rapid economic growth and development.
This objective of economic growth and
development can be achieved by Mobilization of
Financial Resources.
<br>
<br>
The central and the state governments in
India have used fiscal policy to mobilize resources.
The financial resources can be mobilized by:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Taxation: Through effective fiscal policies,
the government aims to mobilize resources
by way of direct taxes as well as indirect
taxes because most important source of
resource mobilization in India is taxation.</li>
        <li>Public Savings: The resources can be mobilized
through public savings by reducing
government expenditure and increasing
surpluses of public sector enterprises.</li>
        <li>Private Savings: Through effective fiscal
measures such as tax benefits, the
government can raise resources from
private sector and households. Resources
can be mobilized through government
borrowings by ways of treasury bills, issue
of government bonds, etc., loans from
domestic and foreign parties and by deficit
financing.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>Efficient allocation of Financial
Resources</b>
<br>
<br>
The central and state governments have
tried to make efficient allocation of financial
resources. These resources are allocated for
Development Activities which includes
expenditure on railways, infrastructure, etc,
whereas Non-development Activities includes
expenditure on defence, interest payments,
subsidies, etc.
<br>
<br>
But generally the fiscal policy should
ensure that the resources are allocated for
generation of goods and services which are
socially desirable. Therefore, India's fiscal
policy is designed in such a manner so as to
encourage production of desirable goods and
discourage those goods which are socially
undesirable.</li>
        <li><b>Reduction in inequalities of Income and
Wealth</b>
<br>
<br>
Fiscal policy aims at achieving equity or
social justice by reducing income inequalities
among different sections of the society. The
direct taxes such as income tax are charged
more on the rich people as compared to lower
income groups. Indirect taxes are also more in
the case of semi-luxury and luxury items, which
are mostly consumed by the upper middle class
and the upper class. The government invests a
significant proportion of its tax revenue in the
implementation of Poverty Alleviation
Programmes to improve the conditions of poor
people in society.</li>
        <li><b>Price Stability and Control of Inflation</b>
        <br>
        <br>
One of the main objectives of fiscal policy
is to control inflation and stabilize price.
Therefore, the government always aims to
control the inflation by reducing fiscal deficits,
introducing tax savings schemes, Productive use
of financial resources, etc.</li>
        <li>Employment Generation
The government is making every possible
effort to increase employment in the country
through effective fiscal measure.</li>
        <li><b>Balanced Regional Development</b>
        <br>
        <br>
Another main objective of the fiscal policy
is to bring about a balanced regional development. There are various incentives from the
government for setting up projects in backward
areas such as Cash subsidy, Concess-ion in
taxes and duties in the form of tax holidays,
Finance at concessional interest rates, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Reducing the Deficit in the Balance of
Payment</b>
<br>
<br>
Fiscal policy attempts to encourage more
exports by way of fiscal measures like
Exemption of income tax on export earnings,
Exemption of central excise duties and customs,
Exemption of sales tax and octroi, etc.
The foreign exchange earned by way of
exports and saved by way of import substitutes
helps to solve balance of payments problem. In
this way adverse balance of payment can be
corrected either by imposing duties on imports
or by giving subsidies to export.</li>
        <li><b>Development of Infrastructure</b>
Government has placed emphasis on the
infrastructure development for the purpose of
achieving economic growth. The fiscal policy
measures such as taxation generates revenue
to the government. A part of the government's
revenue is invested in the infrastructure
development. Due to this, all sectors of the
economy get a boost.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management
(FRBM) Act</i></strong></div>

Enacted in 2003, the Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management Act requires the elimination of revenue deficit by 2008-09. This means
that from 2008-09, the government will have to
meet all its revenue expenditure from its revenue
receipts. Any borrowing would then only be to
meet capital expenditure - repayment of loans,
lending and fresh investment. 
<br>
<br>
The Act also mandates a 3% limit on the fiscal deficit after 2008-
This is a reasonable limit that allows significant leverage to the government to build capacities in the economy without compromising
fiscal stability. It is important to note that since
the entire Budget is at current market prices the
deficits are also calculated with reference to GDP
at current market prices. The main features of
the bill are as follows:
<br>
<br>
The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Bill was introduced in December 2000 and enacted in August 2003. The
rules are effective from July 5, 2004 and the
government has implemented the FRBM Act.
Following are the main features of the FRBM
Act:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Act stipulates the elimination of revenue deficit by March 31, 2008.</li>
        <li>According to the Act, the revenue deficit
is to be reduced by a minimum of 0.5% of
GDP per annum and the fiscal deficit by
0.3%. The rolling targets of FRBM provide for a reduction in the revenue deficit
to 1.5% in 2005-06 and to 1.1% in 2006-
07 and eventually to zero in 2008.</li>
        <li>The FRBM Act also caps the level of guarantees and 
prohibits government to borrow from the RBI after April 1, 2006.</li>
        <li>The Act requires that on a quarterly basis,
the Government would have to place before both the Houses of Parliament an assessment of trends of receipts and expenditure. The Government also has to annually
present the macro-economic framework
statement, medium term fiscal policy statement and fiscal policy strategy statement.
The three statements would provide the
macro economic background and assessment relating to the achievement of FRBM
goals.</li>
        <li>The medium term fiscal policy statement
will contain a three-year rolling target for
key fiscal parameters that underpin the
Government's fiscal correction trajectory.</li>
        <li>Through the FRBM discipline, the Government is also committed to undertake an
intra-year assessment of the achievement
of its budgetary targets.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TAX REFORMS</i></strong></div>

Recommendation of the Chelliah Committee
The tax reform committee under the chairmanship of Raja J. Chelliah (1991) has recommended far reaching changes in the tax system. The main objectives of tax reform were (i)
to remove loopholes from the system that lead
to evasion (ii) to simplify and rationalize the
tax structure, (iii) to make the tax structure
efficient and transparent from the point of view
of revenue collection. In brief the proposals of
the tax reform committee are related with simplification, rationalization and efficiency in the
tax structure.
<br>
<br>
In respect of particular taxes the Chelliah
Committee has, inter-alia, recommended the
following:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Direct Taxes</i></strong></div>

Income Tax: (i) Lower rates of taxation with
a narrower spread between the entry rate and
maximum marginal rate, and a minimum of
tax incentives, (ii) The system of subjecting the
income of both partnership firms as well as the
partners to taxation amounted to double taxation and this should be avoided.
Corporation Tax: Corporation tax rate for
domestic companies being high should be lowered to 40 per cent and the surcharge should
be abolished. Tax rates for foreign companies
should also be lowered and the differential
between the tax rates on domestic and foreign
companies should be around 7.5 percentage
points and in no case to exceed 10 percentage
points.
<br>
<br>
Capital Gains Tax: The present tax treatment of long-term capital gains is not correct
because the deductions allowed in computing
taxable gain is not related to the period of time
for which the assets have been held. It does
not take into account the inflation that may
have occurred over-time. So the committee has
recommended a system of indexation to wardoff the inflationary effect on capital gains.
The Committee also suggested that for levying wealth tax a distinction is to be made
between productive and non-productive assets.
Thus by exempting productive assets such as
shares, securities, bonds, bank deposits, etc.
from wealth tax, the government can encourage investment in them.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indirect Taxes:</i></strong></div>

Customs Duties : Reduction in the general
level of tariffs, a reduction in the dispersion of
the tariff rates and a rationalization of the system with abolition of numerous end-use exemptions and concessions.
Excise Duties: The committee has recommended the switching over to ad-valorem rates
from specific rates. In case a specific rate has
to be retained; the same should be revised every year taking into account the price inflation.
For the sake of efficiency, the committee
recommended a general reduction is exemptions, tax rates and tax slabs. It also emphasized broad basing of the tax system. (Such as
introduction of presumptive tax, taxes on services, etc.)
The government has accepted almost all the
recommendations of Chelliah Committee. All
the budgets after 1991 have tried to accommodate these recommendations. The tax reforms
have led to simplification, rationalization and
broad basing of the tax system. All this has resulted into increase in tax revenue and decrease
in tax evasion and avoidance. The tax system
has become more growth oriented after implementing Chelliah Committee recommendations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kelkar Committee on Tax Reforms</i></strong></div>

In its report presented to the Finance Minister, Mr P. Chidambaram, the Taskforce on
Implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management (FRBM) Act, headed by
Mr Vijay Kelkar, has contended that slashing
Government spending "would be contractionary
for the macro-economy," whereas "raising
tax revenues is likely to be less contractionary."
It has recommended that fiscal consolidation
should be "revenue-led" rather than based
on reduction in expenditures. The report has
also argued that the Government should
enhance capital expenditures "in order to
counter-balance the contractionary effects
of fiscal consolidation." Following are the
main recommendations of the Kelkar
Committee:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A new Income Tax package comprising
two rate-structure and removal of exemptions except for housing loans, women,
and senior citizens.</li>
        <li>Only three rate custom duty structure
reaching ASEAN levels.</li>
        <li>New proposal with states on goods and
service tax.</li>
        <li>Reduction in corporate tax to 30 per cent
for domestic cos.</li>
        <li>Reduction in general depreciation rate
from 25 to 15 per cent</li>
        <li>Existing tax incentives for corporate units
to be "grand fathered" for existing units,
but removed for new units. The report
favoured revenue mobilisation through
low and few tax rates, alongside widening 
of the tax base and shifting the incidence of taxation upon consumption.
There will be only two marginal rates: 20 per
cent for income levels of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 4 lakh
and 30 per cent for incomes above Rs 4 lakh. The
marginal rate would be nil on income levels up
to Rs 1 lakh. At the same time, the standard
deduction available to salaried tax payers will be
done away with and all tax exemptions are to
go, barring those relating to housing loans and
schemes for senior citizens and women.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

For corporates, the Taskforce has similarly
mooted a reduction in the tax rate from 35.875
per cent to 30 per cent for domestic companies,
along with a lowering of the general depreciation rate from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. All
existing tax incentives will be 'grandfathered,' i.e.,
new units will not be entitled for such benefits.
A radical suggestion made by the Taskforce
is to have Goods and Services Tax, which will
be a single country-wide value added tax (VAT)
covering virtually all goods and services. Further, there will be no demarcation between
goods and services on which the powers of
taxation rest only with the Centre or the States.
Instead, the Taskforce has envisaged a 'grand
bargain,' whereby States will have the power
to tax all services concurrently with the Centre, and "both Central and State Government
would exercise concurrent but independent jurisdiction over common or almost common tax
bases extending over all goods and services,
and in both cases, going up to the final consumer."
Within this framework, the report has proposed 
a three-slab ad valorem tax rate structure - 
a floor rate of 10 per cent (6 per cent
levied by the Centre and 4 per cent levied by
States), a standard rate of 20 per cent (12 per
cent plus 8 per cent) and a peak rate of 34 per
cent (20 per cent plus 14 per cent).
As per this, the total tax burden on most
goods would work out to 20 per cent, which
"compared favourably with the standard VAT
rates seen in OECD countries." Further, the
Centre's standard rate would work out to 12
per cent, which is below the existing Cenvat
rate of 16 per cent. The Taskforce has favoured
a 'front-loaded' approach towards meeting the
goal of zero revenue deficit by 2008-09, as per
the FRBM Act.
