<h3>Banking System In India</h3>

Banking is defined as the accepting, for
the purpose of lending or investment of
deposits, money from the public, repayable on
demand or otherwise and withdrawable by
cheque, draft, and order or otherwise. Thus
the two essential functions of banks are to
accept chequable deposits from the public and
lending.
<br>
<br>
Acceptance of chequable deposits is a
necessary, but not sufficient condition for
Financial Institution (FI) to be a bank. For
example, post office savings banks are not banks
in this sense of the term even though they
accept deposits from the public. This is because
they do not perform the other essential function
of lending.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, lending alone does not make FI
a bank. For example, many FIs like LIC, UTI,
and IFC, etc, lend to others but they are not
banks in this sense of the term, as they do not
accept chequable deposits.
The main functions that commercial banks
perform are:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Acceptance of Deposits</i></strong></div>    
            
The bank accepts three types of deposits from
the public:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Current Account Deposits: Deposits in
current accounts are payable on demand.
They can be drawn upon by cheque
without any restriction. These accounts
are usually maintained by businesses and
are used for making business payments.
No interest is paid on these deposits.
However, the banks offer various services
to the account holders for a nominal
charge, the most important being the
cheque facility. Banks keep regular
accounts of all transactions made in a
particular account and submit statements
of the same to the account-holder at
regular intervals.</li>
        <li>Fixed/Term Deposits: These are deposits
for a fixed term (period of time) varying
from a few days to a few years. They are
not payable on demand and do not enjoy
chequing facilities. The moneys deposited
in such accounts become payable only on
the maturity of the fixed period for which
the deposit was initially made. A variant
of fixed deposits are recurring deposits.
In these accounts, a depositor makes a
regular deposit of an agreed sum over an
agreed period e.g. Rs. 100 per month for
5 years. Interest is paid on the deposits in
these accounts.</li>
        <li>Savings Accounts Deposits: These
deposits combine the features of both
current account deposits and fixed
deposits. They are payable on demand and
also withdrawable by cheque, but with
certain restrictions on the number of
cheques issued in a period of time. Interest
is paid on the deposits in these accounts
but the interest paid on savings account
deposits is less than that of the fixed
deposits.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
            <li>
            <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Giving Loans</i></strong></div>    
            
The deposits received by the bank are not
allowed to lie idle by the bank. After keeping
a certain portion of the deposits as reserves,
the bank gives the balance to borrowers in the
form of loans and advances. The different types
of loans and advances made by banks are as
follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Cash Credit: In this arrangement an eligible
borrower is first sanctioned a credit limit
upto which he may borrow from the bank.
This credit limit is determined by the
bank’s estimation of the borrower’s
creditworthiness. However, actual
utilisation of credit by the customer
depends upon his withdrawing power.
The withdrawing power depends on the
value of the borrower’s current assets,
which comprise mainly of stocks of goodsraw materials, semimanufactured or
finished goods, and bills receivable (dues)
from others. The borrower has to submit
a stock statement of his assets to the bank
showing evidence of on-going trade and
production activity and acting as a legal
document in possession of the bank, to be
used in case of default. The borrower has
to pay interest on the ‘drawn’ or utilized
portion of the credit only.</li>
        <li>Demand Loans: A demand loan is one that
can be recalled on demand. It has no stated
maturity. The entire loan amount is paid
in lump sum by crediting it to the loan
account of the borrower. Thus, the entire
loan amount becomes chargeable to
interest. Security brokers and others whose
credit needs fluctuate day to day usually
take these loans. The security against these
loans may be personal, financial assets or
goods.</li>
        <li>Short-term Loans: - Short-term loans may
be given as personal loans, loans to finance
working capital or as priority sector
advances. These loans are secured loans,
i.e. they are loans made against some
security. The whole amount of the term
loan sanctioned is paid in lump sum by
crediting it to the loan account of the
borrower. Thus, the entire loan amount
becomes chargeable to interest. The
repayment is made as scheduled. either
in one instalment at the end of the loan
period, or in a number of instalments over
the period of the loan. In addition,
commercial banks extend the following
facilities when they are demanded by their
customers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
            <li>
            <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Overdrafts</i></strong></div>
                
An overdraft is an advance given by
allowing a customer to overdraw his
current account upto an agreed limit. The
security for overdrafts is usually financial
assets of the account holder such as shares,
debentures, life insurance policies etc.
Overdraft is a temporary facility and the
rate of interest charged on the amount
of credit used is lower than that on
cash credit because the risk involved and
service cost of such credit is less - it is
easier to liquify financial assets than
physical assets.</li>
            <li>
            <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Discounting Bills of Exchange</i></strong></div>
                
A bill of exchange is a document
acknowledging an amount of money owed
in consideration for goods received. For
example, if A buys goods from B, he may
not pay B immediately. He may give B a
bill of exchange, stating the amount of
money owed and the time when the debt
has to be settled, If B wants money
immediately, he will present the bill of
exchange to the bank for discounting. The
bank will deduct a commission and pay
the present value of the bill to B. Upon
maturity of the bill; the bank will secure
payment from A.</li>
            <li>
            <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Investment of funds</i></strong></div>
                
The banks invest their surplus funds in
three types of securities - Government
securities, other approved securities, and
other securities. Government securities are
securities of both the central an state
governments such as treasury bills,
national savings certificates etc.
Other approved securities are securities
approved under the provisions of the
Banking Regulation Act, 1949. These
include securities of state associated bodies
like electricity boards, housing boards,
debentures of Land Development Banks,
units of UTI, shares of Regional Rural
Banks etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
Part of the banks investment in
government securities and other approved
securities are mandatory under the
provisions of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio
requirement of the RBI. However, banks
hold excess investments in these securities
because banks can borrow against these
securities from RBI and others, or sell these
securities in the open market to meet their
need for cash. Banks hold them even
though the return from them is lower
than that on loans and advances because
they are more liquid.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TYPES OF BANKS IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reserve Bank of India</i></strong></div>
            
The Reserve Bank of India Act of 1934
established the Reserve Bank as the central
banking institution of India which controls the
monetary policy of the rupee as well as the
currency reserves. The shares were entirely
owned by private shareholders. Finally Reserve
Bank of India was nationalized in the year
1949.
<br>
<br>
The Bank was constituted for the
following basic functions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To regulate the issue of Bank Notes</li>
        <li>To maintain reserves with a view to
securing monetary stability</li>
        <li>To operate the credit and currency system
of the country to its advantage.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commercial Banks</i></strong></div>    
        
Commercial Banks are banking institutions
that accept deposits and grant short-term loans
and advances to their customers. In addition
to giving short-term loans, commercial banks
also give medium-term and long-term loan to
business enterprises. Now-a-days some of the
commercial banks are also providing housing
loan on a long-term basis to individuals. There
are also many other functions of commercial
banks, which are discussed later in this lesson.
Types of Commercial banks:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Public Sector Banks: These are banks
where majority stake is held by the
Government of India or Reserve Bank of
India. Examples of public sector banks are:
State Bank of India, Corporation Bank,
Bank of Baroda and Dena Bank, etc.</li>
        <li>Private Sectors Banks: In case of private
sector banks majority of share capital of
the bank is held by private individuals.
These banks are registered as companies
with limited liability. For example: The
Jammu and Kashmir Bank Ltd., Bank of
Rajasthan Ltd., Development Credit Bank
Ltd, Lord Krishna Bank Ltd., Bharat
Overseas Bank Ltd., Global Trust Bank,
Vysya Bank, etc.</li>
        <li>Foreign Banks: These banks are registered
and have their headquarters in a foreign
country but operate their branches in our
country. Some of the foreign banks
operating in our country are Hong Kong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation
(HSBC), Citibank, American Express
Bank, Standard & Chartered Bank,
Grindlay’s Bank, etc. The number of
foreign banks operating in our country has
increased since the financial sector reforms
of 1991.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Regional Rural Banks</i></strong></div>
            
Regional Rural Banks were established
under the provisions of an Ordinance
promulgated on the 26th September 1975 and
the RRB Act, 1976 with an objective to ensure
sufficient institutional credit for agriculture and
other rural sectors. The RRBs mobilize financial
resources from rural / semi-urban areas and
grant loans and advances mostly to small and
marginal farmers, agricultural labourers and
rural artisans. The area of operation of RRBs is
limited to the area as notified by Government
of India covering one or more districts in the
State.
<br>
<br>
RRBs are jointly owned by Government of
India, the concerned State Government and
Sponsor Banks (27 scheduled commercial banks
and one State Cooperative Bank); the issued
capital of a RRB is shared by the owners in the
proportion of 50%, 15% and 35% respectively.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Co-operative Banks</i></strong></div>    
        
Co-operative banks are small-sized units
organized in the co-operative sector which
operate both in urban and non-urban centers.
Co-operative Banks in India are registered
under the Co-operative Societies Act. The
cooperative bank is also regulated by the RBI.
They are governed by the Banking Regulations
Act 1949 and Banking Laws (Co-operative
Societies) Act, 1965.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Types of Co-operative Banks</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Primary Credit Societies: These are
formed at the village or town level with
borrower and non-borrower members
residing in one locality. The operations of
each society are restricted to a small area
so that the members know each other and
are able to watch over the activities of all
members to prevent frauds.</li>
        <li>Central Co-operative Banks: These banks
operate at the district level having some
of the primary credit societies belonging
to the same district as their members. These
banks provide loans to their members (i.e.,
primary credit societies) and function as
a link between the primary credit societies
and state co-operative banks.</li>
        <li>State Co-operative Banks: These are the
apex (highest level) co-operative banks in
all the states of the country. They mobilise
funds and help in its proper channelisation
among various sectors. The money
reaches the individual borrowers from the
state co-operative banks through the
central co-operative banks and the
primary credit societies.
Cooperative banks in India finance rural areas
under:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Farming</li>
        <li>Cattle</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Hatchery</li>
        <li>Personal finance</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 
Cooperative banks in India finance urban areas
under:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Self-employment</li>
        <li>Industries</li>
        <li>Small scale units</li>
        <li>Home finance</li>
        <li>Consumer finance</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS KYC NORM?</i></strong></div>

KYC is an acronym for “Know your
Customer”, a term used for customer
identification process. It involves making
reasonable efforts to determine true identity and
beneficial ownership of accounts, source of
funds, the nature of customer’s business,
reasonableness of operations in the account in
relation to the customer’s business, etc which
in turn helps the banks to manage their risks
prudently. The objective of the KYC guidelines
is to prevent banks being used, intentionally or
unintentionally by criminal elements for money
laundering.
<br>
<br>
KYC has two components - Identity and
Address. While identity remains the same, the
address may change and hence the banks are
required to periodically update their records.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS PRIORITY
SECTOR LENDING?</i></strong></div>

Priority sector refers to those sectors of the
economy which may not get timely and
adequate credit in the absence of this special
dispensation. Typically, these are small value
loans to farmers for agriculture and allied
activities, micro and small enterprises, poor
people for housing, students for education and
other low income groups and weaker sections.
Priority Sector includes the following
categories: Agriculture; Micro and Small
Enterprises; Education; Housing; Export Credit
and Others.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS FINANCIAL INCLUSION?</i></strong></div>

A vast section of Indians, particularly
those living on low incomes, can not access Targets and 
Sub-targets for banks under priority sector are as follows:
Categories Domestic commercial banks / Foreign banks with
 Foreign banks with 20 and less than 20 branches “
above branches “
Total Priority 40 32
20 branches “
<br>
<br>
Total agriculture 18 No specific target.
Advances to 10 No specific target.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Weaker Sections</i></strong></div>

mainstream financial products such as bank
accounts and low cost loans. This financial
exclusion forces them to borrow from the
money lenders at high cost. Thus to overcome
this problem, serious attention was given to the
access to banking, access to affordable credit,
and access to free face-to-face money advice.
Financial Inclusion is the process of
ensuring access to appropriate financial
products and services needed by all sections of
the society in general and vulnerable groups
such as weaker sections and low income groups
in particular at an affordable cost in a fair and
transparent manner by mainstream institutional
players.
<br>
<br>
In advanced economies, Financial
Inclusion is more about the knowledge of fair
and transparent financial products and a focus
on financial literacy. In emerging economies, it
is a question of both access to financial products
and knowledge about their fairness and
transparency.
<br>
<br>
The financial services include the entire
gamut - savings, loans, insurance, credit,
payments etc.
RBI has taken following steps for financial
inclusion in India:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>No-Frill accounts: In November 2005, RBI
asked banks to offer no-frills savings
account which enables excluded people
to open a savings account. Normally, the
savings account requires people to
maintain a minimum balance and most
banks now even offer various facilities
with the same. No-frills account requires
no (or negligible) balance and is without
any other facilities leading to lower costs
both for the bank and the individual. The
number of no-frills account has increased
mainly in public sector banks from about
0.4 million to 6 million between March
2006 and March 2007. The number of Nofrill accounts in private sector banks also
increased from 0.2 million to 1 million in
the same period. Recently RBI has directed
all the commercial banks to offer zero
balance account with minimum facilities
like cheque book and ATM to all
customers.</li>
        <li>Usage of Regional language: The Banks
were required to provide all the material
related to opening accounts, disclosures
etc in the regional languages.</li>
        <li>Simple KYC Norms: In order to ensure
that persons belonging to low income
group both in urban and rural areas do
not face difficulty in opening the
bank accounts due to the procedural
hassles, the KYC procedure for opening
accounts has been simplified for those
persons who intend to keep balances not
exceeding rupees fifty thousand (Rs.
50,000/-) in all their accounts taken
together and the total credit in all
the accounts taken together is not
expected to exceed rupees one lakh
(Rs.1,00,000/-) in a year.</li>
        <li>KYC norms include proof of identity and
proof of address. Passport, voter's ID card,
PAN card or driving license are accepted
as proof of identity, and proof of residence
as on ration card, an electricity or
telephone bill or a letter from the employer
or any recognised public authority
certifying the address in order to prevent
identity theft, identity fraud.</li>
        <li>Easier Credit facilities: Banks have been
asked to consider introducing General
purpose Credit Card (GCC) facility up to
Rs. 25,000/- at their rural and semi urban
branches. GCC is in the nature of revolving
credit entitling the holder to withdraw
upto the limit sanctioned. The limit for
the purpose can be set Based on
assessment of household cash flows, the
limits are sanctioned without insistence on
security or purpose. The Interest rate on
the facility is completely deregulated. A
simplified mechanism for one-time
settlement of overdue loans up to
Rs.25,000/- has been suggested for
adoption. Banks have been specifically
advised that borrowers with loans settled
under the one time settlement scheme will
be eligible to re-access the formal financial
system for fresh credit.</li>
        <li>Using Information Technology: A few
Pilot projects have been initiated to test
how technology can be used to increase
financial inclusion such as
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Smart cards for opening bank accounts
with biometric identification.</li>
        <li>Link to mobile or hand held connectivity
devices ensure that the transactions are
recorded in the bank's books on real time
basis.</li>
        <li>Issuance of AADHAR numbers.</li>
        <li>Some State Governments are routing
payments under the National Rural
Employment Guarantee Scheme through
smart cards. The same delivery channel
can be used to provide other financial
services like low cost remittances and
insurance.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Financial Education: RBI has taken
number of measures to increase financial
literacy in the country. It has set up a
multilingual website in 13 languages
explaining about banking, money etc. It
has started putting up comic strips to
explain various difficult subjects like
importance of saving, RBI's functions etc.
These comics explain myriad and complex
concepts in an entertaining manner. The
website states: The Reserve Bank of India
has undertaken a project titled "Project
Financial Literacy". The Objective of the
project is to disseminate information
regarding the central bank and general
banking concepts to various target groups,
including, school and college going
children, women, rural and urban poor,
defence personnel and senior citizens.
The ultimate objective of financial inclusion
is to ensure that banking services reaches to
the poor to ensure inclusive growth.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS NEFT AND RTGS?</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEFT : National Electronic Funds
Transfer System</i></strong></div>

This system is a nationwide funds transfer
system to facilitate transfer of funds from
any bank branch to any other bank branch.
Under this Scheme, individuals, firms and
corporates can electronically transfer funds
from any bank branch to any individual,
firm or corporate having an account with
any other bank branch in the country
participating in the Scheme.
<br>
<br>
Even such individuals who do not have a
bank account (walk-in customers) can also
deposit cash at the NEFT-enabled
branches with instructions to transfer
funds using NEFT. However, such cash
remittances will be restricted to a
maximum of Rs.50,000/- per transaction.
Such customers have to furnish full details
including complete address, telephone
number, etc. NEFT, thus, facilitates
originators or remitters to initiate funds
transfer transactions even without having
a bank account.
<br>
<br>
The NEFT system also facilitates oneway cross-border transfer of funds from
India to Nepal. This is known as the IndoNepal Remittance Facility Scheme. The
beneficiary would receive funds in
Nepalese Currency.
<br>
<b>Advantages:</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The remitter need not send the physical
cheque or Demand Draft to the beneficiary.</li>
        <li>The beneficiary need not visit his / her
bank for depositing the paper
instruments.</li>
        <li>The beneficiary need not be apprehensive
of loss / theft of physical instruments or
the likelihood of fraudulent encashment
thereof.</li>
        <li>Cost effective.</li>
        <li>Credit confirmation of the remittances sent
by SMS or email.</li>
        <li>Remitter can initiate the remittances from
his home / place of work using the internet
banking also.</li>
        <li>Near real time transfer of the funds to the
beneficiary account in a secure manner.
RTGS: Real Time Gross Settlement System
RTGS stands for ‘Real Time Gross
Settlement’. It can be defined as the continuous
(real-time) settlement of funds transfers
individually on an order by order basis (without
netting).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

'Real Time' means the processing of
instructions at the time they are received rather
than at some later time. 'Gross Settlement'
means the settlement of funds transfer
instructions occurs individually (on an
instruction by instruction basis i.e. on one to
one basis). Considering that the funds settlement
takes place in the books of the Reserve Bank of
India, the payments are final and irrevocable.
This is the fastest mode of funds transfer
available in India through banking channel.
The RTGS system is primarily meant for
large value transactions. The minimum amount
to be remitted through RTGS is ` 2 lakh. There
is no upper ceiling for RTGS transactions.
<br>
<b>Advantages:</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Since the funds transfer instructions are
processed and settled in real time, the
credit and liquidity risks are eliminated.</li>
        <li>Leads to a seamless movement of funds
from one end to another using the IT
platform and reduces the systematic risks
in the settlement system.</li>
        <li>As the funds are received instantly online,
in the RTGS system, the collecting banks
and their customers can use the funds
immediately without exposing themselves
to settlement risk.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MONETARY POLICY</i></strong></div>

The use by the Central Bank of interest rate
and other instruments to influence money supply
to achieve certain macro economic goals is known
as monetary policy. Credit policy is a part of
monetary policy as it deals only with how much
and at what rate credit is advanced by the banks.
Objectives of monetary policy are: accelerating
growth of economy, maintaining price stability,
stabilization of exchange rate, balancing savings
and investment and generating employment.
Monetary policy is generally referred to as
either being an expansionary policy, or a
contractionary policy, where an expansionary
policy increases the total supply of money in the
economy, and a contractionary policy decreases
the total money supply. Expansionary policy is
traditionally used to combat unemployment in a
recession by lowering interest rates, while
contractionary policy has the goal of raising
interest rates to combat inflation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tools of Monetary Policy</i></strong></div>

The tools available for the central bank to
achieve the above ends are: Bank rate, Reserve
ratios, Open market operations, Intervention in
the forex market and Moral suasion.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bank rate</i></strong></div>

Bank Rate is the rate at which RBI lends to
commercial banks. Bank Rate is a tool which RBI
uses for managing money supply and credit. Any
revision in Bank Rate by RBI is a signal to banks
to revise deposit rates as well as Prime Lending
Rate. It stands at 6% presently (2008 July)
Reserve Requirements.
<br>
<br>
In economics, fractional-reserve banking is
the near-universal practice of banks in which
banks keep a fraction of the total deposits
managed by a bank as reserves and are not be
lent. The reserve ratios are periodically changed
by the RBI. The reserve requirement (or required
reserve ratio) is a bank regulation that sets the
minimum reserves each bank must hold as a part
of the deposits. These reserves are designed to
satisfy various needs like providing loans to the
Government (SLR) and inflation management
(CRR). They are in the form of RBI approved
securities (SLR) kept with themselves or cash that
is kept with the RBI (CRR).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Statutory liquidity Ratio (SLR)</i></strong></div>

It is the portion of time and demand
liabilities of banks that they should keep in the
form of designated liquid assets like government
and other RBI-approved securities like public
sector bonds; current account balances with other
banks and gold. SLR is aimed at ensuring that
the need for government funds is partly but surely
met by the banks. The commitment of the
Government to reduce fiscal deficit means that it
will borrow less and so the SLR was progressively
brought down from 38.5% in 1991 to 25% today.
The Reserves Bank of India Act, 1934 and
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 fixed the floor
and cap on SLR at 25% and 40% respectively.
But the amendment made in these statutes
removed the limits-lower and upper: RBI has, as
a result, the freedom to fix the SLR at any rate
depending on the macro economic conditions.
The amendment was an enabling one.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</i></strong></div>

CRR is a monetary tool to regulate money
supply. It is the portion of the bank deposits that
a bank should keep with the RBI in cash form.
CRR deposits earn no interest
The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934
and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 fixed
the floor and cap on CRR at 3% and 20%
respectively. But the amendment made in
these statutes removed the limits-lower and
upper. RBI has, as a result, the freedom to fix the
CRR at any rate depending on the macro
economic conditions. The amendment was an
enabling one.
<br>
<br>
CRR is adjusted to manage liquidity and
inflation the more the CRR, the less the money
available for lending by the banks to players in
the economy. CRR was 15% in 1991 and today
it is 8.75%. If inflation is high, money supply
needs to be taken out and so CRR is generally
increased. But in a regime of moderate inflation,
low CRR is in place.
RBI increases CRR to tighten credit for
example, CRR today (July 2008) stands at 8.75%-
high because inflation is also at 13-year high at
1.89% on WPI (July 2008). It needed to be
controlled by a variety of means one of which
was hike in CRR.
<br>
<br>
CRR as a tool of monetary policy is used
when there is a tremendous need to reduce
inflation and tighten credit as in 2008. Otherwise,
normally, RBI relies on open market operations
for liquidity management.
<br>
<br>
Open Market Operations (OMOs) of RBI
OMOs of the RBI can be described as:
<br>
Purchases and sales of government and certain
other securities in the open market (banks and
financial institutions) by the RBI in order to
influence the volume of money and credit in the
economy: Purchases of government securities
injects money. Into the market and thus expands
money and credit; sales have the opposite effect
– absorb excess
Liquidity and shrink credit. Open market
operations are RBI’s most important and
flexible monetary policy tool. Open market
operations do not change the total stock of
government securities but change the proportion
held by the RBI, commercial and cooperative
banks.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ready Forward Contracts (Repos)</i></strong></div>

It is a transaction in which two parties agree
to sell and repurchase the same security. Under
such an agreement the seller sells specified securities
with an agreement to repurchase the same at a
mutually decided future date and a price. Similarly,
the buyer purchases the securities with an agreement
to resell the same to the seller on an agreed date in
future at a predetermined price.
<br>
<br>
In India, RBI lends on a short term basis to
banks on the security of the government paper
(repo). Banks undertake to repurchase the security
at a later date-over night or few days. RBI charges
a repo rate for the money it lends. It is 8.5%
presently (2008 July).
Reverse repo is when RBI borrows from the
market (absorbs excess liquidity) with the sale of
securities and repurchases them the next day or
after a few days. The rate at which it borrows is
called reverse repo rate as it is the reverse of the
repo operation. Reverse repo rate presently is 6%
(July 2008)
<br>
<br>
The repo rate and reverse repo rate are 6%
and 8.5% respectively today (July 2008)
The Repo/Reverse Repo transaction can
only be done at Mumbai and in securities as
approved by RBI (Treasury Bills, Central/State
Govt securities). RBI uses Repo and Reverse repo
as instruments for liquidity adjustment in the
system.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Selective Credit Controls</i></strong></div>

Certain businesses can be given more and
certain others may get less credit from banks on
the orders of the RBI. Thus, selective credit controls
can be imposed for meeting various goals like
discouraging hoarding and black-marketing of
certain essential commodities by traders etc.
Either credit can be rationed or interest rate can
be hiked by RBI as a part of SCCs. In SCCs, the
total quantum of credit does not change, but the
amount lent and the cost of credit may be
changed for specific sector or sectors.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Moral suasion</i></strong></div>

A persuasion measure used by central bank
to influence and pressure, but not force, banks
into adhering to policy. Measures used are closeddoor meetings with bank directors, increased
severity of inspections discussion, appeals to
community spirit etc.
<br>
<br>
Recently the RBI Governor appealed to
banks not to raise rates even though the central
bank was following a tight money policy.
When is the Monetary Policy announced?
Historically, the Monetary Policy is announced twice a year - a slack season policy
(April-September) and a busy season policy
(October-March) in accordance with agricultural cycles. These cycles also coincide with the
halves of the financial year.
Initially, the Reserve Bank of India announced all its monetary measures twice a year
in the Monetary and Credit Policy. The Monetary Policy has become dynamic in nature as
RBI reserves its right to alter it from time to
time, depending on the state of the economy.
However, with the share of credit to agriculture coming down and credit towards the
industry being granted whole year around, the
RBI since 1998-99 has moved in for just one
policy in April-end. However a review of the
policy does take place later in the year.
How is the Monetary Policy different from the

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fiscal Policy?</i></strong></div>

Two important tools of macroeconomic
policy are Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy.
The Monetary Policy regulates the supply of
money and the cost and availability of credit in
the economy. It deals with both the lending
and borrowing rates of interest for commercial
banks.
<br>
<br>
The Monetary Policy aims to maintain price
stability, full employment and economic
growth.
The Reserve Bank of India is responsible for
formulating and implementing Monetary Policy.
It can increase or decrease the supply of currency 
as well as interest rate, carry out open
market operations, control credit and vary the
reserve requirements.
<br>
<br>
The Monetary Policy is different from Fiscal
Policy as the former brings about a change in
the economy by changing money supply and
interest rate, whereas fiscal policy is a broader
tool with the government.
The Fiscal Policy can be used to overcome
recession and control inflation. It may be defined as a deliberate change in government revenue and expenditure to influence the level of
national output and prices.
For instance, at the time of recession the government can increase expenditures or cut taxes
in order to generate demand.
On the other hand, the government can reduce its expenditures or raise taxes during inflationary times. Fiscal policy aims at changing
aggregate demand by suitable changes in government spending and taxes.
The annual Union Budget showcases the
government's Fiscal Policy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What are the objectives of the Monetary
Policy?</i></strong></div>

The objectives are to maintain price stability
and ensure adequate flow of credit to the productive sectors of the economy.
Stability for the national currency (after looking at prevailing economic conditions), growth
in employment and income are also looked into.
The monetary policy affects the real sector
through long and variable periods while the
financial markets are also impacted through
short-term implications.
<br>
<br>
There are four main 'channels' which the RBI
looks at:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li> Quantum channel: money supply and
credit (affects real output and price level
through changes in reserves money,
money supply and credit aggregates).</li>
        <li>Interest rate channel.</li>
        <li>Exchange rate channel (linked to the currency).</li>
        <li>Asset price.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
There are other secondary goals which monetary policy is supposed to take care, growth in
income output and employment. But in developing countries like India the problem of trade cycle
is not the only concern. In such countries monetary policy is framed in such a manner that it
promotes capital formation on the one hand and
addresses the problems of interpersonal, interregional and intersectoral inequality on the other.
Monetary policy has many instruments such as
bank rate, reserve ratio and open market operation policies. These instruments affect the quantity of money supply in the economy directly;
hence they are called quantitative instruments.
There are other instruments, which affect
the direction and amount of credit available to
various sectors and regions through (a) change
in marginal requirements, (b) putting ceiling to
the amount of maximum credit and (c) charging different interest rates for various economic
activities. These instruments are known as instruments of selective credit control or qualitative method of credit control. They are very
relevant in case of developing countries like
India. Monetary policy is framed and implemented by the Central Bank (RBI in case of
India).
<br>
<br>
With the introduction of the Five Year Plans,
the need for appropriate adjustment in monetary and fiscal policies to suit the pace and
pattern of planned development became imperative.
The monetary policy since 1952 emphasised
the twin aims of the economic policies of the
government.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Speed up the economic development in
the country to raise national income and
the standard of living.</li>
        <li>To control and reduce the inflationary
pressure on the economy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

This policy of the Reserve Bank of India since
the First Plan period was termed broadly as
one of 'controlled expansion' i.e. a policy of
"adequate financing of economic growth and
at the same time ensuring reasonable price stability." Expansion of currency and credit was
essential to meet the increased demand for investment funds in an economy like India, which
had embarked on rapid economic development.
RBI recognized and appreciated the need
for expansion of credit and money supply 
commensurate with the rapid development and diversification of the economy. At the same time
it was equally aware that an excessive 
expansion of money and credit would be clearly inflationary and would ultimately endanger the
financial stability of the economy. Accordingly,
the RBI helped the economy to expand through
the expansion of money and credit and attempted to check rise in prices through selective controls.
Monetary policy is formulated with the consideration of macroeconomic objectives generally determined by the government within the
frame of a fiscal budget or annual plan. The
major macroeconomic concerns in India have
been the usual ones - aggregate growth, inflation and the balance of payments.
Until 1974, the preoccupation with inflation
was the concern of monetary policy. After the
abrupt reduction of inflation in the second half
of 1974-75, the emphasis shifted toward achieving higher rates of aggregate growth. After
1979-80, policy efforts shifted, first gradually
and then sharply towards financial restraint as
efforts were mounted to limit the price effects
of a severe drought and sharply reduced
growth.
<br>
<br>
Thus in the pre-reform period monetary
policy played a largely accommodative role to
fiscal policy. The central government had free
access to borrowing from the RBI through ad
hoc treasury bills. It helped to adopt an expansionary fiscal policy and had a multiplier effect
on expansion of money supply.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CREDIT CONTROLS</i></strong></div>

General Credit Controls: These weapons of
control are broadly two: quantitative and qualitative controls. Quantitative controls are used
to control the volume of credit and indirectly
to control inflationary and deflationary pressures caused by expansion and contraction of
credit. Quantitative controls consist of bank rate
policy, open market operations and cash reserve ratio. All these methods have been used
with discretion since the beginning of Planning
in India. Since 1955-56 and particularly after
1973-74 the inflationary rise in price has been
steadily increasing. Increased government expenditure financed through deficit spending has
the direct effect of increasing prices, wages and
incomes. Shortfalls in production, and hoarding and speculation in essential commodities
have contributed to this inflationary pressure.
RBI has various weapons of control and,
through using them; it hopes to achieve its
monetary policy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bank Rate</i></strong></div>

The bank rate is an important monetary instrument in modern economies. Its most useful
role is to signal and/or clarify the central bank's
monetary and interest rate stance to all participants in the financial sector and particularly to
banks. If monetary policy is effective and credible, a change in the bank rate will result in a
change in the prime lending rates of banks and
thus act as an independent instrument of monetary control. However, the role of bank rate
as an instrument of monetary policy has been
very limited in India because of the following
basic factors:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The structure of interest rates is administrated by the RBI - they are not 
automatically linked to the bank rate.</li>
        <li>The commercial banks enjoy specific refinance facilities, and do not necessarily
rediscount eligible securities at the bank
rate.</li>
        <li>The bill market is under developed and
the different sub markets of the money
market are not influenced by the bank
rate.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In other words, the bank rate in India is not
the pace setter to other market interest rates of
interest and the money market rates do not automatically adjust themselves to changes in the
bank rate. At the same time, the deposit and
lending rates of banks (and of development financial institutions) are not related to the bank
rate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cash Reserve Requirements (CRR)</i></strong></div>

Another weapon available to the RBI for
credit control is use the of variable cash reserve
requirements. Under the RBI Act 1934, every
commercial bank has to keep certain minimum
cash reserves with the RBI. Initially it was 5%
against demand deposits and 2% against time
deposits. These are known as the statutory cash
reserves. Since 1962, the RBI was empowered
to vary the cash reserve requirements between
3% and 15% of total demand and time deposits. The RBI has varied the CRR a number of
times to reduce or increase bank credit.
In accordance with the Narasimham Committee recommendations the CRR has been kept
low since 1992.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Statutory Liquidity Requirements (SLR)</i></strong></div>

Apart from the cash reserve requirements
which the commercial banks have to keep with
the RBI, all banks have to maintain with the
RBI or with themselves liquid assets in the form
of cash, gold and unencumbered approved securities equal to not less than 25% of their total
time and demand deposits. This is known as
the statutory liquidity requirement as has to be
maintained in addition to the CRR. A higher
SLR ratio works in two ways:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It reduces the money supply in the
economy and thus is deflationary</li>
        <li>It can also be used to divert funds to
finance government expenditure</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Open Market Operations</i></strong></div>

In economies with well developed money
markets central banks use open market operations - i.e. buying and selling of eligible securities by the central bank in the money market -
to influence volume of cash reserves with the
commercial banks and thus influence the volume of loans and advances that they can make
to the commercial sector. The RBI had not used
this instrument for many years. Since 1991, the
enormous inflow of foreign funds into the Indian
economy created the problem of excess liquidity
with the banking sector and the RBI undertook
large scale open market operations. When RBI
sells government securities in the open market, it
withdraws a part of the cash reserves of the
commercial banks, and thereby reduces their
ability to lend to industrial and commercial sectors. Thus money supplies contracts.
The opposite will happen if the RBI buys
securities from the open market and pays for
them. The commercial banks will find that they
have more surplus cash. Thus money supply
increases.
<br>
<br>
Selective and Directed Credit Controls
Under the Banking Regulation Act 1949,
Section 21 empowers RBI to issue directive to
the banking companies regarding their advances. These directives may relate to:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The purpose for which advances may or
may not be made.</li>
        <li>The margins to be maintained with regard
to secured advances.</li>
        <li>The maximum advance to any borrower.</li>
        <li>The maximum amount upto, which
guarantees may be given by the banking
company on behalf of any firm, company,
etc.</li>
        <li>The rate of interest and other terms and
conditions for granting advances.
Since 1956-57 the RBI has made full use of
Section 21 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949
to check speculation and rising prices, the 
controls are selective as they are used to check the
rising tendency of prices of certain individual
commodities of common use.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Generally the RBI uses three kinds of Selective Credit Controls:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimum margin for lending against certain specific securities.</li>
        <li>Ceiling on amounts of credits for certain
purposes.</li>
        <li>Discriminatory rates of interest charged on
certain types of advances.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

While imposing selective controls, RBI takes
great care that bank credit for production and
transportation of commodities exports is not
affected. Selective credit controls are mainly
focussed on credit to traders for financing
inventories (for purpose of hoarding and speculation).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Non-Performing Assets</i></strong></div>

In common parlance, the loans which have
become "bad loans" or such loans whose recovery is not possible are called Non-performing assets (NPAs). The issue of Non-performing assets (NPAs) in the financial institutions
in India has assumed a disturbing dimension.
The problem of NPAs, however, is not peculiar
to India alone. Countries such as Japan and
China are notoriously known for their huge
NPAs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Meaning of NPAs</i></strong></div>

An asset is classified as non-performing asset (NPAs) if dues in the form of principal and
interest are not paid by the borrower for a
period of 180 days. However with effect from
March 2004, default status has been given to a
borrower if dues are not paid for 90 days. If
any advance or credit facilities granted by bank
to a borrower become non-performing, then the
bank will have to treat all the advances/credit
facilities granted to that borrower as non-performing without having any regard to the fact
that there may still exist certain advances /
credit facilities having performing status.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Difference between Gross NPAs and Net
NPAs</i></strong></div>

In view of the time lag in recovery process
and the detailed procedures and safeguards involved in regard to write-off, even after making provisions for advances considered as irrecoverable banks continue to hold such advances
in their books. These are termed as gross NPAs
while provisioning adjusted NPAs are termed
as net NPAs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CLASSIFICATION OF BANK ASSETS</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RBI Guidelines on Classification of Bank
Aadvances</i></strong></div>

Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has issued guidelines on provisioning requirement with respect
to bank advances. In terms of these guidelines,
bank advances are mainly classified into:
Standard Assets: Such an asset is not a nonperforming asset. In other words, it carries not
more than normal risk attached to the business.
Sub-standard Assets: It is classified as non-performing asset for a period not exceeding 18 months.
Doubtful Assets: Asset that has remained
NPA for a period exceeding 18 months is a
doubtful asset.
<br>
<br>
Loss Assets: Here loss is identified by the
banks concerned or by internal auditors or by
external auditors or by Reserve Bank India (RBI)
inspection.
In terms of RBI guidelines, as and when an
asset becomes a NPA, such advances would be
first classified as a sub-standard one for a period that should not exceed 18 months and
subsequently as doubtful assets.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RBI guidelines on Provisioning Requirement
of Bank Advances</i></strong></div>

As and when an asset is classified as an
NPA, the bank has to further sub-classify it
into sub-standard, loss and doubtful assets.
Based on this classification, bank makes the
necessary provision against these assets.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Capital Adequacy Ratio</i></strong></div>

Capital Adequacy Ratio or Capital to Risk
Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) refers to the ratio
between total capital and risk weighted assets of
a bank. Risk weighting became necessary in view
of the adoption of Basel-I by the Indian banks.
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
is an institution created by the central bank
Governors of the Group of Ten nations. It was
created in 1974 and meets regularly four times
a year. The Committee's members come from
Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
China, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, India, 
Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Russia, Saudi
Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom
and the United States. The Committee usually
meets at the Bank for International Settlements
(BIS) in Basel, Switzerland, where its 12 member permanent 
Secretariat is located. The Committee is often referred to as the BIS Committee
after its meeting location. However, the BIS and
the Basel Committee remain two distinct entities.
The Basel Committee formulates broad supervisory standards and 
guidelines and recommends statements of best practice in banking
supervision.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Basel I</i></strong></div>

Basel I is the round of deliberations by central
bankers from around the world, and in 1988,
the Basel Committee (BCBS) in Basel, Switzerland, published a set of minimal capital requirements for banks. This is also known as the 1988
Basel Accord, and was enforced by law in the
Group of Ten (G-10) countries in 1992 . Basel
I is now widely viewed as outmoded. Indeed,
the world has changed as financial conglomerates, financial innovation and risk management
have developed. Therefore, a more comprehensive set of guidelines, known as Basel II are in
the process of implementation by several countries and new updates in response to the financial crisis commonly described as Basel III. Basel
I, that is, the 1988 Basel Accord, primarily focused on credit risk. Assets of banks were classified and grouped in five categories according
to credit risk, carrying risk weights of zero (for
example home country sovereign debt), ten,
twenty, fifty, and up to one hundred per cent
(this category has, as an example, most corporate debt). Banks with international presence
are required to hold capital equal to 8 % of the
risk-weighted assets. However, large banks like
JPMorgan Chase found Basel I's 8% requirement to be unreasonable, and implemented
credit default swaps so that in reality they
would have to hold capital equivalent to only
1.6% of assets. Since 1988, this framework has
been progressively introduced in member countries of G-10, currently comprising 13 countries, namely, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom
and the United States of America.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Basel II</i></strong></div>

Basel II is the second of the Basel Accords,
which are recommendations on banking laws
and regulations issued by the Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision. The purpose of Basel
II, which was initially published in June 2004,
is to create an international standard that banking regulators can use when creating regulations about how much capital banks need to
put aside to guard against the types of financial and operational risks banks face. Advocates of Basel II believe that such an international standard can help protect the international financial system from the types of problems that might arise should a major bank or
a series of banks collapse. In theory, Basel II
attempted to accomplish this by setting up risk
and capital management requirements designed
to ensure that a bank holds capital reserves
appropriate to the risk the bank exposes itself
to through its lending and investment practices. Generally speaking, these rules mean that
the greater risk to which the bank is exposed,
the greater the amount of capital the bank
needs to hold to safe-guard its solvency and
overall economic stability.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Basel III</i></strong></div>

Basel III is a new global regulatory standard
on bank capital adequacy and liquidity agreed
by the members of the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision. The third of the Basel
Accords was developed in a response to the
deficiencies in financial regulation revealed by
the global financial crisis. Basel III strengthens
bank capital requirements and introduces new
regulatory requirements on bank liquidity and
bank leverage. The OECD estimates that the
implementation of Basel III will decrease annual GDP growth by 0.05 to 0.15 percentage
point.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Securitisation Bill (2002)</i></strong></div>

It's a known fact that the banks and financial
institutions in India face the problem of swelling non-performing assets (NPAs) and the issue is becoming more and more unmanageable. In order to bring the situation under control, some steps have been taken recently. The
Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial
Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act,
2002 was passed by Parliament, which is an
important step towards elimination or reduction of NPAs.
An economy with foreign trade with the rest of
the world is known as 'open economy'. An
economy with no foreign trade is known as a
'closed economy'. Erstwhile Soviet Union was a
closed economy. At present all the economies
are 'open economies'. "Autarky" is a term used
for self-sufficient closed economy. "Globalisation"
means opening up of the economy and 
integrating it with world economies. International trade
involves exchange of goods and services as well
as foreign currencies. Trade in goods is known
as merchandise trade, while trade in services is
known as 'invisible trade'. Real Investment or
investment in productive/industrial activities by
foreigners is known as Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Investment in financial instruments
such as banks and stock market is known as
portfolio investment.
