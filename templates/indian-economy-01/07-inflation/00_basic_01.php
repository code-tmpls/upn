<h3>Inflation</h3>

<b>Inflation</b> is a rise in the general level of
prices of goods and services in an economy over
a period of time. When the general price level
rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods
and services. Consequently, inflation also reflects
erosion in the purchasing power of money.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>As for example</i></strong></div>

If we were able to buy 1kg of rice at say
Rs.50 but due to price rise same amount is
costing Rs.70. The price rise of the commodities
over a period of time is inflation that is affecting
the purchasing power of the people. This in
turn reduces the value of money as for each
commodity we have to spend more than the
previous one.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Types Of Inflation</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Demand pull inflation: This type of
inflation occurs when total demand for
goods and services in an economy exceeds
the supply of the same. When the supply
is less, the prices of these goods and
services would rise, leading to a situation
called as demand-pull inflation. This type
of inflation affects the market economy
adversely during the wartime.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>As for example</i></strong></div>

High prices of onions: Due to the crop
failure the supply of onions decreased but
the demand among the masses remained
the same. Thus as a result prices increased
drastically reached around Rs.80. The
government had imported the onions from
Pakistan. As the supply increases in the
market the prices automatically decrease.
Thus this is demand pull inflation. The
vicious circle of demand and supply
controls the prices".</li>
        <li>Cost-push Inflation: If there is increase
in the cost of production of goods and
services, due to increase of wages and raw
materials cost, there is likely to be a
consequent increase in the prices of
finished goods and services.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>As for example</i></strong></div>

High petrol prices: ongoing increase in
the prices of petrol is resulting in high
inflation rate. Since petroleum is so
important to developing economies, a
large increase in its price can lead to the
increase in the price of most products,
raising the inflation rate.</li>
        <li>Pricing Power Inflation: Pricing power
inflation is more often called as
administered price inflation. This type of
inflation occurs when the business houses
and industries decide to increase the price
of their respective goods and services to
increase their profit margins. A point
noteworthy is pricing power inflation does
not occur at the time of financial crisis
and economic depression, or when there
is a downturn in the economy. This
type of inflation is also called as
oligopolistic inflation because oligopolies
have the power of pricing their goods and
services.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>As for example</i></strong></div>

Increment in prices of cars: due to
increase in cost of steel, plastic etc and to
maintain profit margins the price of cars
have to be increased.</li>
        <li>Sectoral Inflation: The sectoral inflation
takes place when there is an increase in
the price of the goods and services
produced by a certain sector of industries.
For instance, an increase in the cost of
crude oil would directly affect all the other
sectors, which are directly related to
the oil industry. Thus, the ever-increasing
price of fuel has become an important
issue related to the economy all over the
world.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>As for example</i></strong></div>

Increment in airfare: In Aviation industry
when the price of oil increases, the ticket
fares also go up.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Concepts related to Inflation
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Stagflation: It is a situation in which
the inflation rate is high and the economic
growth rate is low. It raises a dilemma for
economic policy since actions designed to
lower inflation may worsen economic
growth and vice versa.
<br>
<br>
There can be two reasons for stagflation:
Firstly, stagflation can result when the
productive capacity of an economy is
reduced by an unfavorable supply shock,
such as an increase in the price of oil for
an oil importing country. Such an
unfavorable supply shock tends to raise
prices and slows the economy by making
production more costly and less profitable.
Secondly, stagflation can result due to
inappropriate macroeconomic policies.
For example, central banks can cause
inflation by permitting excessive growth
of the money supply and the government
can cause stagnation by excessive
regulation of goods markets and labour
market.</li>
        <li>Reflation: It is the act of stimulating
the economy by increasing the money
supply or by reducing taxes. It is an act of
pumping money in the market to increase
the circulation so that economy can be
stipulated again.
<br>
<br>
As in U.S to increase the growth rate
government has announced special bailout
packages for the companies thus trying to
pump economy out of recession.</li>
        <li>Disinflation: It is a decrease in the rate
of inflation – a slowdown in the rate of
increase of the general price level of goods
and services in a nation's gross domestic
product over time.</li>
        <li>Deflation: It is a decrease in the
general price level of goods and
services. Deflation occurs when
the inflation rate falls below 0% (a
negative inflation rate). This should not be
confused with disinflation which is a slowdown in the inflation rate (i.e. when
inflation declines to lower levels).</li>
        <li>Hyper inflation: It is the extremely rapid
escalation of prices (typically more than
50% per month) for goods and services.
The most famous hyperinflation of the
modern era occurred in Germany in 1920-
1923 when the government began printing
money to make up for revenue lost. The
German hyperinflation resulted in a
percentage increase in prices in the
millions per month. Other cases of
hyperinflation (Greece, Hungary)
following World War II were even more
extreme. The root cause of hyperinflation
tends to be the excessive printing of
currency by the monetary authority.
Hyperinflation is extremely disruptive by
making savings worthless very quickly,
thus encouraging workers to spend money
as fast as it is earned.</li>
        <li>Recession: A significant decline in activity
across the economy, lasting longer than a
few months is recession. It is visible in
industrial production, employment, real
income and wholesale-retail trade. The
technical indicator of a recession is two
consecutive quarters of negative economic
growth as measured by a country's gross
domestic product (GDP).</li>
        <li>Depression: It is a sustained, long-term
downturn in economic activity in one or
more economies. A depression is
characterized by its length, by abnormally
large increases in unemployment, falls in
the availability of credit— often due to
some kind of banking or financial crisis,
shrinking output—as buyers dry up and
suppliers cut back on production, and
investment, large number
of bankruptcies—including sovereign debt
defaults, significantly reduced amounts
of trade and commerce—especially
international, as well as highly volatile
relative currency value fluctuations—most
often due to devaluations.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>How Inflation Is Measured</i></strong></div>

Inflation is measured using two price
indexes CONSUMER PRICE INDEX and
WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX.
<br>
<br>
A price index is a normalized weighted
average of prices for a given class of
goods or services in a given region, during a
given interval of time. It is a statistic designed
to help to compare how these prices, taken as
a whole, differ between time periods
Price indices have several potential uses.
For particularly broad indices, the index can
be said to measure the economy's price level or
a cost of living.
<br>
<br>
A price index is selected and its index is
assumed as 100 and on this basis price index
for the current year is calculated. If index is
below 100 it indicates deflation whereas if high
then inflation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CONSUMER PRICE INDEX</i></strong></div>

A consumer price index (CPI) measures
changes in the price level of consumer
goods and services purchased by households. It
is a measure that examines the weighted
average of prices of a basket of consumer goods
and services, such as transportation, food
and medical care. The CPI is calculated by
taking price changes for each item in the
predetermined basket of goods and averaging
them; the goods are weighted according to their
importance. Changes in CPI are used to assess
price changes associated with the cost of living.
In India CPI is calculated in different fields
as:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>CPI-IW i.e. Consumer Price Index for
Industrial Workers (BASE YEAR IS 2001)</li>
        <li>CPI-AL i.e. Consumer Price Index
for Agricultural Labour (BASE YEAR IS
1986-87)</li>
        <li>CPI-RL i.e. Consumer Price Index for Rural
Labours (BASE YEAR IS 1986-87)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHOLESALE PRICE INDEX</i></strong></div>

The Wholesale Price Index or WPI is the
price of a representative basket of wholesale
goods. The Indian WPI figure is released
monthly and influences stock and fixed price
markets. The Wholesale Price Index focuses on
the price of goods traded between corporations,
rather than goods bought by consumers, which
is measured by the Consumer Price Index. The
purpose of the WPI is to monitor price
movements that reflect supply and demand in
industry, manufacturing and construction. This
helps in analyzing both macroeconomic and
microeconomic conditions. Base year for WPI
is 2004-05.
<br>
<br>
The limitations of WPI are related to
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Non-inclusion of services;</li>
        <li>following a fixed weighting scheme while
the economy is undergoing major
structural changes,</li>
        <li>use of gross transactions data rather than
data on final purchases.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MONETARY MEASURES
TO CONTROL INFLATION
(GIVEN BY RBI)</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Cash reserve ratio:</b>
Cash reserve Ratio (CRR) is the amount
of funds that the banks have to keep with RBI.
If RBI decides to increase the per cent of this,
the available amount with the banks comes
down. RBI is using this method (increase of
CRR rate), to drain out the excessive money
from the banks.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect on inflation</i></strong></div>

The foremost reason of inflation is
increment in money supply in the market. Cash
reserve ratio is the amount kept by banks in
RBI. If for example the bank has 100000 rupees
and CRR is 10% then 10% of 100000 has to be
kept with RBI i.e. 10000 rupees. Now if the
CRR increased to 12% then banks has to kept
12% of 100000 i.e. 12000 with RBI. Hence the
money with the banks decreases as CRR
increases and thus money supply in the market
decreases too and hence the inflation decreases.</li>
        <li><b>Statutory liquidity ratio:</b>
Statutory Liquidity Ratio is the amount of
liquid assets, such as cash, precious metals or
other approved securities, that a financial
institution must maintain as reserves other than
the Cash with the Central Bank

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect on inflation</i></strong></div>

As we have understood that the foremost
reason of inflation is increment in money supply
in the market. SLR is the amount of assets
maintained by a bank. If for example the bank
has 1000000 rupees and SLR is 20% then 20%
of 1000000 have to be maintained by banks i.e.
200000 rupees in form of gold, securities etc.
Now if the SLR increased to 30% then banks
has to kept 30% of 1000000 i.e. 300000. Hence
the money with the banks decreases as SLR
increases and thus money supply in the market
decreases too and hence the inflation decreases.</li>
        <li><b>Bank rate:</b>
This is the rate at which central bank
(RBI) lends money to other banks or financial
institutions. If the bank rate goes up, longterm interest rates also tend to move up, and
vice-versa. Thus, it can said that in case bank
rate is hiked, in all likelihood banks will hikes
their own lending rates to ensure and they
continue to make a profit.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect on inflation</i></strong></div>

When the private or public banks are in
need of money, they borrow from RBI. RBI
lends them at a rate known a bank rate (simply
the interest at which money is given).
As for example if the bank rate increases
interest given by banks to RBI increases thus
banks money circulation decreases. Decrement
in money circulation decreases inflation.</li>
        <li><b>Repo rate and reverse repo rate:</b>
A repurchase agreement is the sale
of securities together with an agreement for the
seller to buy back the securities at a later date.
The repurchase price should be greater than
the original sale price, the difference effectively
representing interest, called the repo rate. The
party that originally buys the securities
effectively acts as a lender. The original seller is
effectively acting as a borrower, using their
security as collateral for a secured cash loan at
a fixed rate of interest.
<br>
<br>
A reverse repo is simply the same
repurchase agreement from the buyer's
viewpoint, not the seller's. Hence, the seller
executing the transaction would describe it as
a "repo", while the buyer in the same
transaction would describe it a "reverse repo".
So "repo" and "reverse repo" are exactly the
same kind of transaction, just described from
opposite viewpoints. The term "reverse repo and
sale" is commonly used to describe the creation
of a short position in a debt instrument where
the buyer in the repo transaction immediately
sells the security provided by the seller on the
open market.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect on inflation</i></strong></div>

A reduction in the repo rate will help banks
to get Money at a cheaper rate. When the repo
rate increases borrowing from the central bank
becomes more expensive. In order to increase
the liquidity in the market, the central bank
increases or decreases the rate. Thus inflation get automatically controlled.</li>
    </ul>
