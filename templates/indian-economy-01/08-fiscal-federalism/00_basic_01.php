<h3>Fiscal Federalism</h3>

Fiscal federalism concerns the division of
public sector functions and finances among
different tiers of government. In undertaking this
division, economics emphasizes the need to
focus on the necessity for improving the
performance of the public sector and the
provision of their services by ensuring a proper
alignment of responsibilities and fiscal
instruments. While economic analysis, as
encapsulated in the theory of fiscal federalism,
seeks to guide this division by focusing on
efficiency and welfare maximization in
determining optimal jurisdictional authority, it
needs to be recognized that the construction of
optimal jurisdictional authority in practice goes
beyond purely economic considerations. Political
considerations, as well as historical events and
exigencies, have in practice, played major roles
in shaping the inter–governmental fiscal
relations in most federations.
Even in non–federal states, there has been a
growing movement towards greater fiscal
decentralisation in recent years. Some analysts
have attributed this to globalisation and
deepening democratisation the world over on
the one hand and increasing incomes on the
other.
<br>
<br>
Other specific reasons for increasing
demand for decentralisation are:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>It is becoming increasingly impossible for
the Central Governments to meet all of the
competing needs of their various
constituencies, and are attempting to build
local capacity by delegating responsibilities
downward to their regional governments.</li>
            <li>Central governments are looking to local
and regional governments to assist them
on national economic development
strategies.</li>
            <li>Regional and local political leaders are
demanding more autonomy and want the
taxation powers that go along with their
expenditure responsibility.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

Moreover, in recent years, decentralisation
has become a feature of reform agenda promoted
and supported by the World Bank and other
multilateral institutions. The rationale for this has
been in part that decentralisation promotes
accountability. It is not therefore surprising that
by 1997, 62 of 75 developing nations had
embarked on one form of decentralisation or
another.
<br>
<br>
An important feature of a successful system
of fiscal federalism is the assignment of adequate
revenue powers to sub-national governments to
forge a strong link between revenue and
expenditures at the margin. This is necessary for
both efficiency and accountability reasons.
Assignment of revenue powers is also necessary
to ensure a hard budget constraint.
The transfer system should address the
problem of imbalance between revenue and
expenditure powers and should enable every
governmental unit to provide comparable levels
of public services at comparable tax rates. At the
same time, it is important to ensure that the
transfer system does not provide the incentive
to “raid the fiscal commons”. Ensuring proper
incentive structure in the transfer system is
critical to preventing the soft budget constraints.
<br>
<br>
It is necessary to ensure that the transfer system
does not enable the states to pass on the burden
of their public services to non–residents. In
addition to equalisation transfers, specific
purpose matching (open-ended) transfer should
be designed to compensate the public services
provided by the sub national governments, the
benefit of which spill over the jurisdictions. A
major advantage of a multilevel fiscal system is
the large common market, but the benefit can
accrue only when not only all impediments to
trade in factors of production as well as
commodities are removed, but also mobility of
commodities, capital and goods is facilitated.
Ensuring a common market is at the heart of
creating dynamism in fiscal federalism. Such
impediments can be posed by policies restricting
the movement of labour, capital, and
commodities. It was also recognised that, given
the multiplicity of local public goods with varying
geographical patterns of consumption, there was
hardly any level of government that could
produce a perfect mapping for all public goods.
Thus, it was recognised that there would be local
public goods with inter–jurisdictional spill–overs.
For example, a road may confer public goods
characteristics, the benefits of which are enjoyed
beyond the local jurisdiction. The local authority
may then under-provide for such a good. To
avoid this, the theory then resorts to traditional
Pigouvian subsidies, requiring the central
government to provide matching grants to the
lower level government so that it can internalise
the full benefits.
<br>
<br>
Based on the following, the role of
government in maximising social welfare
through public goods provision came to be
assigned to the lower tiers of government. The
other two roles of income distribution and
stabilisation were, however, regarded as suitable
for the central government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PRINCIPLES OF FISCAL FEDERALISM</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Independence and Responsibility</i></strong></div>

The central facet of federations is the division
of powers and functions between the federal
government and the state governments. The
division of financial resources and obligations as
between the two levels of governments should
correspond to the division of powers and
functions. Earnest efforts have to be made to
ensure that each level of government is
financially self–sufficient and independent of
each other to the maximum extent possible.
Political autonomy will be meaningless unless it
is supported by financial autonomy. No doubt,
concerns which are of national character, or
which transcend the interests of one unit, should
be entrusted to the central government.
Functions of a purely local character, confined
to a unit in each and objectives for instance,
should generally be left to the Central
Government. Normally, there should be occasion
for the central government to encroach upon
jurisdiction of the unit governments and vice–
versa. In times of national emergencies, however,
the Constituent units shed some of their political
and financial jurisdiction in favour of the central
government for achieving national objectives.
Federal Constitutions usually contain specific
provisions to cope with such contingencies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Adequacy and Elasticity</i></strong></div>

Financial independence also implies that
central and unit governments should have
adequate financial powers to perform their
exclusive functions. The correspondence
between revenues and functions should be
understood in a dynamic sense. The sources of
revenue should be elastic enough to keep pace
with the growth of responsibilities in the specified
spheres of activity. In order to implement a
process of national development, the central
governments were made financially strong both
in terms of powers and resources. Customs
revenue is, therefore, left in all federations to the
central government. Same is the case with direct
taxation. The sources of revenue for each level
of government should be such that the revenues
generated should not remain static but should
be quite elastic. The revenues should increase as
the needs of the governments grow. None of the
governments would want to be burdened with
static sources which will soon fall behind the
demand that a government will have to face and
meet.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Efficiency</i></strong></div>

The system of distribution of functions should
conform to the requirements of efficiency and
economy. “No matter how well intentioned a
scheme may be or how completely it may
harrnonise with the abstract principles of justice,
if the tax does not work administratively, it is
doomed to failure”. Two factors determine the
effectiveness of different taxes, namely, nature
of the tax and the character of administration.
A land tax for instance, may be expected to be
administered best by local authorities because “it
is, after all, the local assessors who may be
presumed to possess the most exact knowledge
of the local conditions upon which the value of
the land depends”. One of the reasons for the
formation of a federation is that a government
at a the federal level will be efficient for the
nation as a whole: the division of sources is,
therefore, based on the principle of relative
interest and efficiency. Taxes which have an
inter–state base, like customs, income and wealth
tax are assigned to the federal government and
those which have a local base, like sales tax and
entertainment tax, are assigned to the states.
Costs of collection of taxes, the feasibility of
levying taxes at the nationwide level rather than
at the local level are important considerations in
the allocation of powers and functions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Equity</i></strong></div>

Fiscal federation is viewed within the
framework of welfare economics. Equitable
distribution of wealth and income of the
community are the proper concerns of a welfare
state. Experts argue that the entire system of
federal and state taxation and expenditure
should be so framed as to impose equal burdens
and confer equal benefits upon similarly placed
persons irrespective of their residence. From the
point of view of the nation, there is a distinct
advantage in taxing the richer states more and
spending that revenue in poorer states since the
sacrifice in extra taxation in richer states is less
than the benefit that will be derived if that
money were spent in poorer states. The ideal is
to maximise national benefit from the state and
federal expenditure. This would necessitate a
reduction of welfare generating expenditure in
richer states and an increase in such expenditure
in poorer states. Federal fiscal operations have
an equalizing role in respect of tax burdens and
benefits from public expenditure as between the
affluent and less fortunate states. Distributive
aspects of income and wealth are best performed
by the central government. If redistribution
policy is left to the state governments regional
disparities may be perpetuated. Rich may leave
the region where redistribution measures are
more egalitarian, while the poor will move to
such regions. Progressive income tax which is
an important redistribution measure must be
uniform throughout the country. This is possible
only when the tax is entrusted to the national
government.

Salient Features of Indian Fiscal Federalism:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Most populous and diverse democratic
federal polity</li>
        <li>Transition from plan to market: Need for
reforms in policies and institutions (implicit
transfers, common market principles,
regional equity)</li>
        <li>Globalization and fiscal federalism:Need to
reorient the system to create a competitive
environment.</li>
        <li>Changing political environment:emergence
of coalition government at Centre, regional
parties in States, latter becoming pivotal
members in Central coalition government,
changing priorities and time horizons of
political parties.</li>
        <li>Notable Feature: Holding the country
together for 60 years; Constitution with
fundamental rights guaranteed;
Independent judiciary; free press and steel
frame bureaucracy.</li>
        <li>Dissatisfaction: Has not reaped gains from
“magnitude and littleness”; highly
centralised system; impediments to common
market; Regional aspirations and demand
for statehood; absence of satisfactory
institutional mechanism to resolve with
Centre–State and inter-State disputes.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIA’S CONSTITUTIONAL
STRUCTURE RELATED TO FINANCE</i></strong></div>

Indian Constitution has made elaborate
provisions, relating to the distribution of the taxes
as well as non-tax revenues and the power of
borrowing, supplemented by provisions for
grants-in-aid by the Union to the States.
Article 268 to 293 deals with the provisions
of financial relations between Centre and States.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Constitution divides the taxing
powers between the Centre and the states
as follows:
<br>
The Parliament has exclusive power to levy
taxes on subjects enumerated in the Union List,
the state legislature has exclusive power to levy
taxes on subjects enumerated in the State List,
both can levy taxes on the subjects enumerated
in Concurrent List whereas residuary power of
taxation lies with Parliament only.</li>
        <li>The distribution of the tax-revenue
between the Union and the States stands
as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Duties Levied by the Union but
Collected and Appropriated by the
States: Stamp duties on bills of
Exchange, etc., and Excise duties on
medical and toilet preparations
containing alcohol. These taxes don’t
form the part of the Consolidated Fund
of India, but are assigned to that state
only.</li>
        <li>Service Tax are Levied by the Centre
but Collected and Appropriated by the
Centre and the States.</li>
        <li>Taxes Levied as Well as Collected by
the Union, but Assigned to the States:
These include taxes on the sale and
purchase of goods in the course of interstate trade or commerce or the taxes
on the consignment of goods in the
course of inter-state trade or commerce.</li>
        <li>Taxes Levied and Collected by the
Union and Distributed between
Union and the States: Certain taxes
shall be levied as well as collected by
the Union, but their proceeds shall be
divided between the Union and the
States in a certain proportion, in order
to effect on equitable division of the
financial resources. This category
includes all taxes referred in Union List
except the duties and taxes referred to
in Article 268, 268-A and 269;
surcharge on taxes and duties
mentioned in Article 271 or any Cess
levied for specific purposes.</li>
        <li>Surcharge on certain duties and taxes
for purposes of the Union: Parliament
may at any time increase any of the
duties or taxes referred in those articles
by a surcharge for purposes of the
Union and the whole proceeds of any
such surcharge shall form part the
Consolidated Fund of India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Grants-in-Aid</i></strong></div>

Besides sharing of taxes between the Center
and the States, the Constitution provides for
Grants-in-aid to the States from the Central
resources. There are two types of grants:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Statutory Grants: These grants are
given by the Parliament out of the
Consolidated Fund of India to such
States which are in need of assistance.
Different States may be granted
different sums. Specific grants are also
given to promote the welfare of
scheduled tribes in a state or to raise
the level of administration of the
Scheduled areas therein (Art.275).</li>
        <li>Discretionary Grants: Center provides
certain grants to the states on the
recommendations of the Planning
Commission which are at the discretion
of the Union Government. These are
given to help the state financially to
fulfill plan targets (Art.282).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Effects of Emergency on Center-State Financial
Relations:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>During National Emergency: The President
by order can direct that all provisions
regarding division of taxes between Union
and States and grants-in-aids remain
suspended. However, such suspension shall
not go beyond the expiration of the financial
year in which the Proclamation ceases to
operate.</li>
        <li>During Financial Emergency: Union can
give directions to the States:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To observe such canons of financial
propriety as specified in the direction.</li>
        <li>To reduce the salaries and allowances
of all people serving in connection with
the affairs of the State, including High
Courts judges.</li>
        <li>To reserve for the consideration of the
President all money and financial Bills,
after they are passed by the Legislature
of the State.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TYPES OF TAXES IN INDIAN
FINANCIAL SYSTEM</i></strong></div>

Taxes represent the amount of money we pay
to the Government at predefined rates and
periodicity. Taxes are the basic source of revenue
to the Government using which it provides
various kinds of services to the tax payers. There
are mainly two types of Taxes, direct tax and
indirect tax which are governed by two different
boards, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)
and Central Board of Excise and Customs
(CBEC).
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Direct Taxes</i></strong></div>
            
Direct taxes are the personal liability of tax
payer. These are collected directly from the tax
payers and they have to be paid by the persons
on whom it is imposed. Important direct taxes
are listed below:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Income Tax - This is most important
type of direct tax and almost everyone
is familiar with it. TDS is its famous
synonym and whosoever is earning
above a minimum amount (tax
exemption limit) has to pay income tax.</li>
        <li>Wealth Tax - This is in addition to the
income tax and is levied if your net
wealth exceeds Rs. 30 Lakh at the rate
of 1% on the amount exceeding Rs 30
Lakh. “In Budget 2013-2014 Finance
Minister Mr P. Chidambaram
introduced a surcharge of 10 percent
on taxpayers with an annual taxable
income of more than 1 crore (10
million) rupees</li>
        <li>Property Tax/Capital Gains Tax - This
is levied on the capital gains arrived by
selling property and stocks. Tax rates
are different for long term and short
term capital gains.</li>
        <li>Gift Tax/ Inheritance or Estate Tax -
Amount exceeding Rs. 50000 received
without consideration by an
individual/HUF from any person is
subjected to gift tax as income under
"other sources". There are exemptions
like money received from relatives is
not taxable. Marriage gifts and money
received through inheritance are also
exempt from gift tax. Inheritance tax
was earlier in practice but has been
repealed by the government.</li>
        <li>Corporate Tax - Companies operating
in India are taxed as per the corporate
tax rate on their income. This tax is
one of the major sources of revenue for
government.“</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indirect Tax</i></strong></div>    
       
Impact and incidence of indirect Taxes fall
on different persons as opposed to direct taxes
where impact and incidence is on the same
person. These taxes are recovered from different
groups of people but the liability remains with
the person who collects it. Tax payer recovers
the indirect taxes paid from their consumers and
clients and finally pays it to government. For
example, when we purchase any product we pay
VAT, when we eat in restaurants we pay service
tax which are ultimately deposited in
government's kitty by the service providers. Brief
about various types of indirect taxes is given
below:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Service Tax</b>:
Service providers in India are subject to
service tax, which is charged on the aggregate
amount received by the service provider. Services
like leasing, internet/voice, transport, etc are
subject to service tax.</li>
        <li><b>Custom Duty</b>:
Custom duties are indirect taxes which are
levied on goods imported to/exported from
India. There are different rules for different types
of goods and sectors. Government keeps on
changing these rates so as to promote import/
export of specific goods.</li>
        <li><b>Excise Duty</b>:
Excise duties are indirect taxes which are
levied on goods manufactured in India for
domestic consumption. Like custom duty, there
are a number of rules which keep on changing
as per government discretion.</li>
        <li><b>Sales Tax and VAT</b>:
Sales tax is levied by the government on sale
and purchase of products in Indian market. As
customers, whatever you buy from the market,
you pay sales tax on it. Now, sales tax is
supplemented with new Value Added Tax so as
to make it uniform across country.</li>
        <li><b>Security Transaction Tax (STT)</b>:
STT is levied on transactions (sale/purchase)
done through the stock exchanges. STT is
applicable on purchase or sale of various
financial products like stocks, derivatives, mutual
funds etc.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li></li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FINANCE COMMISSION OF INDIA</i></strong></div>

The Finance Commission of India came into
existence in 1951. The Finance Commission is
established under Article 280 of the Indian

to give a structured format to the Finance
Commission of India as per the world standard.
The need for the Finance Commission was felt
by the British for guiding the finance of India.
The structure of the modern Act was laid in the
early 1920’s. The Finance Commission is formed
to define the financial relations between the
Centre and the State. The Finance Commission
Act of 1951 tells about the qualification,
appointment, term, eligibility, disqualification,
powers, etc. of the Finance Commission.

The ThFC has recommended higher transfers
of Central taxes and Finance Commission grants
to be provided by the Centre to the States as
compared with what the Twelfth Finance
Commission (TwFC) had advised. The ThFC has
recommended that the share of the States in the
net proceeds of Central tax collections be fixed
at 32% over the ThFC’s award period, higher
than the share of 30.5% that had been set by the
TwFC for the award period 2005-06 to 2009-10.
Additionally, the total grant of Rs. 3,185.81
billion to be provided by the Centre to the State
Governments over the ThFC award period is
more than twice the amount recommended by
the TwFC. The ThFC’s recommendations on
Central tax devolution and grants would serve
to reduce the vertical imbalance between the
Centre and the States and are a positive from
the point of view of fiscal federalism. The ThFC,
by modifying the criteria and the associated
weights governing horizontal devolution, has
changed the inter se shares of the Indian States
within the overall pool of shareable taxes.
Regardless of the lowering of the inter se shares
for some States, the taxes to be devolved to all
the States over the ThFC period are likely to be
substantially higher than they were during the
TwFC period, considering the anticipated
buoyancy in Central tax collections following
resumption of higher economic growth from
2010–11 onwards, reversal of certain tax cuts
and the possibility of successful implementation
of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). Thus, all
States are expected to witness a significant
increase in the magnitude of transfers (Central
taxes + Finance Commission grants) during the
ThFC period over the TwFC period.
<br>
<br>
Higher transfers would boost the State’s
revenue receipts, thereby creating fiscal space for
the State Governments to incur additional
expenditure while at the same time providing
assistance for the attainment of the fiscal targets
laid down by the ThFC. However, maintaining
a check on the pace of expenditure growth and
enhancing the quality of expenditure would be
critical to achieving structural improvement in
the States’ finances over the medium term.
Prioritizing of expenditure would be crucial to
improve socio-economic indicators and attain
developmental goals.
<br>
<br>
While higher devolution of taxes to the States
implies lower net tax revenues for the Central
Government, the anticipated increase in tax
buoyancy over the medium term suggests that
the Centre’s net tax collections would also enjoy
healthy growth. Nonetheless, expenditure
adjustments at the Centre, rather than overreliance on revenue growth, remain critical in
the pursuit of sustainable fiscal consolidation at
the national level. The total grant of Rs. 3,185.81
billion to be provided by the Centre to the State
Governments over the ThFC award period
includes an amount of Rs. 875.19 billion for
further transfer from the States to their Local
Bodies. The latter amount is more than thrice
the sum recommended by the TwFC (Rs. 250
billion), and being so would augment the
revenues and improve the financial position of
the Local Bodies significantly. However, an
increase in the magnitude and improvement in
the regularity of devolution by the State
Governments to their Local Bodies would also
be required to reduce the resource gap of the
latter and enable improved delivery of services.
<br>
<br>
During the first three years of the TwFC
period, high revenue growth helped the Centre
and the States achieve considerable success in
their endeavor towards fiscal adjustment. With
incentives aimed at encouraging fiscal
consolidation provided by the Debt
Consolidation and Relief Facility (DCRF) of the
TwFC, a number of States were able to achieve
considerable improvement in their fiscal balances
in the first three years of the TwFC period.
However, this was followed by slippages in the
subsequent two years marked by a slowdown
in economic and revenue growth and an
increase in expenses because of Pay Commission
related payouts in a number of States.
The ThFC has suggested a revised fiscal
roadmap for the Centre and the States to provide
the basis for sustainable adjustment of public
finances going forward. The ThFC has set a
target of reducing the consolidated debt stock of
the Centre and the States to 68% of gross
domestic product (GDP) by 2014–15 from an
estimated 82% of GDP in 2009–10. In accordance
with the projected debt to GDP ratios over the
ThFC period, the ThFC has drawn up roadmaps
for the Centre and the States, which specify
timelines for the elimination of revenue deficits
and reduction in the financing gap 1 to 3% of
GDP for the Centre and 3% of gross state
domestic product (GSDP) for the States. The
annual borrowing limits of the latter are to be
determined by GoI on the basis of the level of
the financing gap envisaged as per the fiscal
reform path indicated by the ThFC for the period
2011–12 to 2014–15. This mechanism is expected
to induce the States to adhere to the financing
gap targets. ICRA believes this mechanism
would help maintain the focus on fiscal
consolidation at the State level. However, in the
absence of a mechanism (like the TwFC’s DCRF
facility) to incentivize compliance with the fiscal
targets set by the ThFC, the efficacy of the ThFC’s
recommendations for fiscal consolidation
remains to be seen; the extent of success in this
regard is likely to hinge on the commitment
demonstrated by individual States to the goal of
fiscal consolidation.
<br>
<br>
The ThFC has recommended that the States
maintain their financing gap at 3% of GSDP
beyond 2014–15, and that the Centre raise
additional resources and pass these on to the
States in accordance with the horizontal
devolution formula in the event of
macroeconomic shocks. This would help
maintain the focus on fiscal consolidation at the
State level over the course of business cycles and
prevent such slippages as seen during the last
two years of the TwFC period, which coincided
with the macroeconomic slowdown in India.
If implemented, the ThFC’s recommendation
that structural shocks, such as payout of Pay
Commission related arrears, be avoided and
would help smoothen the revenue expenditures
of the State Governments and prevent income–
expenditure mismatches. As has historically been
seen in India, settlement of large Pay Commission
related arrears imposes considerable stress on the
fiscal balances of the State Governments, which
then take recourse to higher debt, in the process
suffering deterioration in their debt service
indicators. While avoidance of such structural
shocks would prevent the periodic weakening
of the States’ credit profiles, it remains to be seen
whether this recommendation is politically
acceptable. The ThFC has suggested resetting of
the interest rate on loans to the States from the
National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) to reduce
the interest asymmetry between the Centre and
the States. The interest rate on loans contracted
by the States from the NSSF until 2006–07 and
outstanding at the end of 2009–10 is to be reset
at 9%, from either 9.5% or 10.5% at present based
on the date on which the loans were contracted.
This is estimated to provide a benefit of Rs. 135.17
billion to the States over the ThFC period.
<br>
<br>
The ThFC has also recommended write-off
of Rs. 45.06 billion worth of loans from GoI to
the State Governments administered by
ministries / departments other than the
Ministry of Finance (MoF). The magnitude of
these benefits is however small relative to the
benefits that the States derived from the DCRF facility.
