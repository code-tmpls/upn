<h3>Money Market Instruments In India</h3>

The money market is a monetary system of
lending and borrowing of short-term funds.
Money markets exist to facilitate efficient
transfer of short-term funds between holders and
borrowers of cash assets. For the lender/investor,
it provides a good return on their funds. For the
borrower, it enables rapid and relatively
inexpensive acquisition of cash to cover shortterm liabilities. RBI being the main constituent in
the money market aims at ensuring that liquidity
and short term interest rates are consistent with
the monetary policy objectives.

Features of Indian Money Market
Money market in India has the following
features.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Existence of Unorganized Money Market</i></strong></div>    
        
The existence of the indigenous bankers
has always been the major defect of the
Indian money market, as these indigenous
bankers do not distinguish between the
purposes of finance. RBI’s control over the
money market is limited, to the extent that
these bankers/companies are outside the
organized money market.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Absence of Integration</i></strong></div>    
        
At one time, Indian money market was
divided into several segments or sections,
loosely connected to each other. Each
section of the money market limited itself
broadly to a particular class of business
and remained independent in its own
sphere. Furthermore, relations were not
very cordial between the various sections
of money market. This prevails even now
between Indian banks and foreign banks.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Diversity in Money Rates of Interest</i></strong></div>    
        
The existence of too many rates of interest
is yet another defect of the Indian money
market—the borrowing rate of the
government, the deposit and lending rates
of commercial banks, deposit and lending
rates of cooperative banks, the lending
rates of Development Financial
Institutions, etc are different. Immobility
of fund from one section of the money
market to another provides the basic
reason for the existence of so many rates
of interest simultaneously. However, different
money rates of interest have been promptly
adjusting to changes in the bank rate.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Seasonal stringency of Money</i></strong></div>
            
There prevails seasonal monetary
stringency and high rates of interest
during the busy season from November
to June when funds are required to move
the crops from the village and countryside
to the cities and ports. Banks carry large
surplus funds and the rates of interest
reach low levels during the off-season (July
to October) or slack season. There are even
now wide fluctuations in the money rates
of interest from one period of the year to
another.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Highly Volatile Call Money Market</i></strong></div>
            
The call money rate refers to the rate at
which funds are borrowed in this market.
Call money rates are market-determined—
by demand for and the supply of short
term funds.
<br>
<br>
The demand for the short term funds
comes from public sector banks (about 80
per cent of the borrowing) and foreign
banks and private sector banks which
together account for the balance of 20 per
cent. While some banks fulfill their
banking activities as of both lenders and
borrowers, others act either as borrowers
or lenders. Non-bank financial institutions
such as IDBI, LIC, GIC & others account
for 80 per cent of the total funds supply.
While balance 20 per cent of the funds
are supplied by the banks in the call
money market. The call money market
rates used to rise to 7 to 8 per cent during
the busy season, even before 1935 while
in the slack season they fell to ½ per cent
per annum. The call money rates have
continued to be highly volatile,
notwithstanding RBI made all the efforts
to moderate the fluctuations on the call
money rates. The high rates reflected the
huge demand for short term funds by the
banking system specially to meet the
condition of minimum CRR.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Availability of Credit Instruments</i></strong></div>    
        
The Indian money market did not have
adequate short term paper instruments till
1985-86. There was only the Treasury Bill
market apart from the call money market.
At the same time there were no specialist
dealers and brokers dealing in different
segments of the Indian money market and
in different kinds of paper instruments.
The Reserve Bank of India started
introducing new paper instruments only
after 1985-86, such as 182 days treasury
bills , later converted to 364 days treasury
bills, certificate of deposit and commercial
paper.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Different instruments of the Money Market are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Call Money:</b>
Call money is a method of borrowing and
lending for one day. This is also called
overnight money. The rate of interest used
to be decided by RBI earlier. After 1989,
the interest rate was deregulated and now
the liquidity position (availability of funds)
determines the rate of interest. Only
permitted organizations like scheduled
com-mercial banks, large co-operative
banks, DHFI, Primary dealers, NABARD
are permitted to borrow funds through
call money market. However, funds can
be provided or lent even by other entities
like LIC, GIC, large corporate, big mutual
funds, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Treasury Bills (T-Bills):</b>
Treasury Bills, one of the safest money
market instruments, are short term
borrowing instruments of the Central
Government of the Country issued
through the Central Bank (RBI in India).
Treasury bills began being issued by the
Indian government in 1917. They are
short-term instruments issued by the
Reserve Bank of India. They are one of
the safest money market instruments
because they are risk free, but the returns
from this instrument are not very high.
They have 3-month, 6-month and 1-year
maturity periods. The price with which
treasury bills are issued comes separate
from that of the face value, and the face
value is achieved upon maturity.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Repurchase Agreements</i></strong></div>

Repurchase transactions, called Repo or
Reverse Repo are transactions or short
term loans in which two parties agree to
sell and repurchase the same security.
Repo/Reverse Repo transactions can be
done only between the parties approved
by RBI and in RBI approved securities viz.
GOI and State Govt Securities, T-Bills, PSU
Bonds, FI Bonds, Corporate Bonds etc.
Under repurchase agreement the seller
sells specified securities with an agreement
to repurchase the same at a mutually
decided future date and price. Similarly,
the buyer purchases the securities with
an agreement to resell the same to the
seller on an agreed date at a
predetermined price.
<br>
<br>
Such a transaction is called a Repo when
viewed from the perspective of the seller
of the securities and Reverse Repo when
viewed from the perspective of the buyer
of the securities. Thus, whether a given
agreement is termed as a Repo or Reverse
Repo depends on which party initiated the
transaction. The lender or buyer in a Repo
is entitled to receive compensation for use
of funds provided to the counterparty.
Effectively the seller of the security borrows
money for a period of time (Repo period)
at a particular rate of interest mutually
agreed with the buyer of the security who
has lent the funds to the seller. The rate of
interest agreed upon is called the Repo
rate. The Repo rate is negotiated by the
counterparties independently of the
coupon rate or rates of the underlying
securities and is influenced by overall
money market conditions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commercial Papers</i></strong></div>

Commercial papers are usually known as
promissory notes which are unsecured
and are generally issued by companies
and financial institutions, at a discounted
rate from their face value. The fixed
maturity for commercial papers is 1 to 270
days. The purposes with which they are
issued are - for financing of inventories,
accounts receivables, and settling shortterm liabilities or loans. The return on
commercial papers is always higher than
that of T-bills. Say, for example, a
company has receivables of Rs 1 lacs with
credit period 6 months. It will not be able
to liquidate its receivables before 6 months.
The company is in need of funds. It can
issue commercial papers in form of
unsecured promissory notes at discount
of 10% on face value of Rs 1 lacs to be
matured after 6 months. The company has
strong credit rating and finds buyers
easily. The company is able to liquidate
its receivables immediately and the buyer
is able to earn interest of Rs 10K over a
period of 6 months. They yield higher
returns as compared to T-Bills as they are
less secure in comparison to these bills;
however chances of default are almost
negligible but are not zero risk
instruments. Commercial paper being an
instrument not backed by any collateral,
only firms with high quality credit ratings
will find buyers easily without offering any
substantial discounts. It was in 1990 that
Commercial papers were first issued in
the Indian money market.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Certificate of Deposit:</i></strong></div>

It is a short term borrowing more like a
bank term deposit account. It is a promissory
note issued by a bank in form of a certificate
entitling the bearer to receive interest. The
certificate bears the maturity date, the fixed rate
of interest and the value. It can be issued in any
denomination. They are stamped and transferred
by endorsement. However, on payment of certain
penalty the money can be withdrawn on demand
also. The returns on certificate of deposits are
higher than T-Bills because it assumes higher level
of risk. It was in 1989 that the certificate of deposit
was first brought into the Indian money market.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Origin</i></strong></div>

The entire quantity of bills, coins, loans,
credit and other liquid instruments in
a country's economy is known as money
supply.
Money supply is divided into multiple
categories - M0, M1, M2 and M3 - according to the
type and size of account in which the instrument
is kept. The money supply is important to
economists trying to understand how policies will
affect interest rates and growth
“M0 = Currency in circulation + bankers deposits with the RBI + other deposits with RBI
<br>
M1 = Currency with the Public + Demand Deposits with the banking system + Demand
Liabilities portion of Savings Deposits with the
banking system + other deposits with the bank
<br>
M2 = M1 + Savings deposits with Post office savings banks.
<br>
M3 = M2 + Time deposits with the contractual maturity of over one year with the
banking system + Call Borrowings from ‘NonDepository’ Financial Corporations by the
banking system
<br>
M3 is termed as broad money and M1 is
known as narrow money.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Liquidity aggregates in India</i></strong></div>

Liquidity is the degree to which an asset or
security can be bought or sold in the market
without affecting the asset's price. Liquidity is
characterized by a high level of trading activity.
Assets that can be easily bought or sold are
known as liquid assets.
“There are three measures of liquidity in
India
L1 = M3 + all deposits with post office savings bank except NSC
<br>
L2 = L1 + term deposits with Term Lending
Institutions and Refinancing Institutions (FIs) + term borrowing by FIs and Certificates of Deposits
issued by FIs
<br>
Quarterly compilation
<br>
L3 = L2 + public deposits of non banking
financial companies.
