<h3>Indian Capital Market</h3>

The capital market provides an alternative
mechanism for allocating resources; channelises
household savings to the corporate sector and
allocates funds among firms. In this process it
allows both firms and households to share risk.
The capital market enables the valuation of firms
on an almost continuous basis and it plays an
important role in the governance of the
corporate sector. The reforms in the capital
market are aimed at enhancing the efficiency,
safety, integrity and transparency of the
market.
<br>
<br>
Capital market is the market for long term
funds, just as the money market is the market
for short term funds. Capital market refers to
all the facilities and the institutional
arrangement for borrowing and lending
medium and long term funds. It is concerned
with the raising of money/capital for
investment purpose. Private sector
manufacturing industries, agriculture and the
government predominantly make demand of
long term capital for purpose of investment.
The central and state governments require
substantial sums from the capital market and
they invest not only on economic overheads as
transport, irrigation and power development
but also on basic industries and sometimes even
consumer goods industries. Individual savers,
corporate savings, banks, insurance companies,
specialized financing agencies and government
are important supplier of funds for the capital
market. Among institutions, commercial banks
are important investors, but are largely
interested in government securities and to a
small extent on investment in debentures of
companies; LIC and GIC are of growing
importance in the Indian capital market though
their major interest is still in government
securities; Private funds constitute a major
medium of savings but their investments too
are mostly in government securities; and special
institutions, set up since independence—IFCI,
ICICI, IDBI, UTI etc.—all these aim at providing
long term capital to the private sector.
<br>
<br>
Gilt-edged market and the industrial
securities market are two prominent
constituents of the Indian capital market. The
gilt-edged market refers to the market for
government and semi-government securities
backed by the Reserve Bank of India.
Structure of the Capital Market
The capital market can be divided into two
constituents, the financial institutions and the
securities market. The financial institutions
provide long term and medium term loans. The
securities market is divided into (a) the gilt
edged market (or the market for government
securities), and (b) the corporate or industrial
securities market.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gilt-Edged market</i></strong></div>
            
The gilt-edged market is also known as
the securities guaranteed (both principal and
interest) by the government apart from
government securities. The government
securities are risk free because the government
can’t default on its payment obligations and
are hence known as gilt-edged (which means
'of the best quality'). The important
characteristics of the government securities are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It is without risk and returns are
guaranteed. There is no place for
speculation and manipulation of the
market as also no uncertainties regarding
yield, payment on time, etc.</li>
        <li>Government securities market consists of
the new issues market and the secondary
market. R.B.I. is responsible for all the new
issues of government loans, as it manages
entirely the public debt operations of both
the central and state governments. The
secondary market deals in old issues.</li>
        <li>The investors in the gilt-edged market are
predominantly institutions—commercial
banks, Life Insurance Corporation,
General Insurance Corporation and the
provident funds—which are required
statutorily to invest a certain portion of
their funds in government securities. These
institutions mobilise the savings of the
people through their various scheme and
invest a certain proportion in government
securities.</li>
        <li>Government securities are the most liquid
debt instruments.</li>
        <li>The transactions in the government
securities market are large.
Many private sector mutual funds have
entered this market in a considerable way in
recent times and have floated various gilt-edge
funds for this purpose on account of the riskfree returns guaranteed by the government
securities market and its high liquidity. Many
risk-averse individual investors ( particularly
those belonging to fixed-income groups) have
welcomed this opportunity as investment in
guilt-edged funds is better than investment in
bank fixed deposits due to better liquidity and
exemption from tax on dividends.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Corporate Securities Market</i></strong></div>
            
Securities issued by firms (i.e. shares,
bonds and debentures) can be bought and sold
freely in corporate securities market. It
comprises the new issues market (the primary
market) and the secondary market (stock
exchanges).</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The New Issues Market/Primary Market</i></strong></div>    
        
The new issues market is concerned with
the issue of new securities—bonds debentures,
shares and so on. Funds are often raised by the
public limited companies from the primary
market for setting up or expanding their
business. However, the company has to fulfill
various requirements and decide upon the
appropriate timing and method of issue for
selling its securities. The various methods
through which capital can be raised are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>By Prospectus: Capital can be raised from
the general public by the issue of
prospectus which is an invitation to the
general public for subscribing to the
capital. The prospectus contains various
details regarding particulars of the
company, its financial position etc.</li>
        <li>By Offer for Sale: A method similar to
the prospectus where initially shares are
taken up by a third party in bulk. The
peculiar feature of this arrangement is that
while company already receives the
money, any premium received from the
public goes to this third party rather than
to the company.</li>
        <li>By Private Placing: The shares are sold to
individuals or institutions directly by
making a private appeal to them. The cost
of raising capital in this method becomes
far lesser than the cost of raising capital
via other methods.</li>
        <li>By offering Rights Issue: By this,
companies raise capital from the existing
shareholders. Under this method of
issuance, the shareholders have the right
to a certain number of shares in
proportion to the shares held by them.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Secondary Market/ Stock Exchange</i></strong></div>
            
The stock exchange or the secondary
market is a highly organized market for the
purchase and sale of second-hand quoted or
listed securities (quoting or listing of a particular
security implies incorporating that security in
the register of the stock exchange so that it can
be bought and sold there). A stock exchange is
an association, organization or body of
individuals, whether incorporated or not,
established for the purpose of assisting,
regulating and controlling business in buying,
selling and dealing in securities, as has been
defined by the securities Contracts (Regulation)
Act, 1956.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>GREENEX</i></strong></div>
            
The BSE has launched the Green
Index called Greenex. This is India's first
carbon-efficient live index. The index has been
developed by the BSE in collaboration with IIM
Ahmedabad. It is the second thematic index
launched by BSE. BSE Greenex will measure the
performances of companies in terms of carbon
emissions. The index will target socially-aware
investors. There are many investors willing to
pay a premium for green investments in
companies to get better returns.
<br>
<br>
The new index will comprise 20 stocks
based on a minimum carbon footprint, market
capitalisation and turnover. The BSE Greenex
will assess the energy efficiency of firms, based
on energy and financial data.
The selection of companies was on the basis
of greenhouse emissions in the last four financial
years from 2007-08 till 2010-11 . The companies
were tested in different combinations of carbon
emission intensity, market capitalisation, and
turnover. The index comprises 20 companies
from the BSE 100. It gives equal weightage to
both energy efficiency and profitability -
together indicating a long-term sustainable
strategy.
<br>
<br>
This is the first index based on actual
performance on the energy efficiency front,
rather than stated future plans. The index
follows a sector-specific algorithm. Each
company is measured only against the best in
the same industry, based on disclosed energy
and financial data. The index will have fair
representation of firms from all sectors. It will
include topranking companies from each sector.
The index can be used to develop green
financial products including mutual funds,
exchange-traded funds and structured
products. Further, the index is expected to
enable investors to take more informed
investment decisions on companies in the
energy-intensive sectors. It will help screen
companies doing well on the carbon side, as
the concerns of climate change is growing
among stakeholders.
<br>
<br>
The index can be used by individual and
institutional investors such as asset management
companies, pension funds, and insurance
companies looking for investments in companies
with strong long-term prospects and develop
green financial products.</li>
