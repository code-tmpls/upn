<h3>Services Sector</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Background</i></strong></div>

India continued to follow import
substitution strategy (ISS) of growth during the
period 1951-1980. “The ISS with heavy
‘industry’ first strategy with central planning
created a plethora of controls, procedures,
permits and bureaucratic restrictions”. The ISS,
along with other factors landed us into
economic crisis of 1990-91. The New Economic
Policy of July, 1991 heralded a new era for
India by introducing comprehensive reforms
in industrial sectors as well as in services sector.
It was expected that these policy measures
would restore the health of the economy and
put it on higher growth trajectory.
<br>
<br>
As a consequence of the adoption of the
New Economic Policy(NEP) of 1991, the
growth rate of the Indian economy which stood
at 3.5 per cent per annum during 1951-79, 5.0
per cent per annum during 1980-91, in fact
accelerated to 6.1 per cent per annum during
1992-2000 (IDR, 2002). The economy has
moved on from the ‘Hindu Rate of Growth’ of
3.5% per annum of yesteryears to ‘unstoppable
India’ at 9 % per annum at present. India
emerged as one of the fastest growing
economies of the world during the 1990s.The
remarkable performance of India’s economy is
attributable in significant part to the
spectacular dynamism shown by the services
sector.

Against this background, it would be every
appropriate to answer some questions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly, what are the constituents of service
sector in India?</li>
        <li>Secondly, how this sector performed on
growth and employment fronts?</li>
        <li>Thirdly, what happened to service sector
productivity in post 1980 period?</li>
        <li>Fourthly, what are the policies adopted by
the government of India to promote the
services sector?</li>
        <li>Fifthly, what are the problems or challenges
ahead in this sector?</li>
        <li>Lastly, what are the prospects /potential
for growth in this sector.</li>

Composition of Service Sector in India
In India, the national income classification
given by Central Statistical Organization is
followed. In the National Income Accounting
in India, service sector includes the following:

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sectoral Composition of GDP Growth</i></strong></div>    
        
The analysis of the sectoral composition of
GDP and employment for the period 1950-2000
brings out the fact that there has taken place
‘tertiarization’ of the structure of production
and employment in India. During the process
of growth over the years 1950-51 to 1999-2000,
the Indian economy has experienced a change
in production structure with a shift away from
agriculture towards industry and tertiary sector.
The share of agricultural sector in real GDP at
1993-94 prices declined from 55.53% in the
1950’s to 28.66 % in 1990’s.The share of
industry and services increased from 16% to
27.12% and 28.09% to 44.22% respectively
during the same period. During the 1950’s it
was the primary sector which was the
dominant sector of the economy and accounted
for the largest share in GDP. But the whole
scenario changed subsequently, and especially
in the 1980’s. The service sector output
increased at a rate of 6.63% per annum in the
period 1980-81 to 1989-90 (i.e. pre-reform
period) compared with 7.71% per annum in
the period 1990-91 to 1999-2000 (i.e. postreform period). The tertiary sector emerged as
the major sector of the economy both in terms
of growth rates as well as its share in GDP in
1990s. It is to be noted here that while
agriculture and manufacturing sectors have
experienced phases of deceleration, stagnation
and growth, the tertiary sector has shown a
uniform growth trend during the period 1950-
51 to 1999-2000. The share of this sector in
GDP further increased to 55.1% in 2006-07.
This sector accounted for 68.6% of the overall
average growth in GDP in the last five years
between 2002-03 and
2006-07.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Employment Scenario</i></strong></div>    
        
The sectoral distribution of workforce in
India during the period 1983 to 2004-05 reveals
that the structural changes in terms of
employment have been slow in India as the
primary sector continued to absorb 56.67% of
the total workforce even in 2004-05, followed
by tertiary and industrial sectors (24.62% and
18.70%) respectively. There has been
disproportionate growth of tertiary sector, as
its share in employment has been far less when
compared to its contribution to GDP.
It is important to point out that, within the
services sector employment growth rate is
highest in finance, insurance, and business
services, followed by trade, hotels and
restaurants and transport, etc. The community,
social and personal services occupy the last rank
in growth rates of employment.
<br>
<br>
Further, there was a sharp drop in labour
absorptive capacity of growth in the economy
(employment elasticity of growth) from 0.40 to
0.15 during post -reform period (1993-94 to
1999-2000) initially, reflecting the phenomenon
of jobless growth. However, during 1999-2000
to 2004-05 period the employment elasticity of
growth registered an increase from 0.15 to 0.51.
With the exception of one sub-sector of tertiary
sector i.e., transport, storage, communication
and all other sub-sectors of services sector
exhibited an increasing trend in employment
elasticties and thereby overall elasticity of
employment increased from 0.15 to 0.5.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Productivity Growth in Service Sector --
Post-1980 Scenario</i></strong></div>    
        
The process of acceleration in growth
started in 1980s rather than in 1990s. “Of the
2.4 percentage point increase in the rate of
economic growth that took place in the post1980 period, about 40 per cent is accounted for
by a faster growth in TFP in services.” The
three sectors viz. agriculture, industry and
services have witnessed acceleration in the
growth rates of output, output per worker and
total factor productivity (TFP) in the post -1980
period. However, the increase is more marked
in case of services. Partially the spurt in growth
rate is attributable to productivity growth in
certain sub-sectors of services sector. It has been
noticed that growth rate in output per man is
highest in case of PA & D and other community
social and personal services (4.2% p.a), followed
by transport, storage, communication (3.3 %
pa), trade, hotels, restaurants (2.9%pa) and
banking, insurance, real estate and business
services. The acceleration in growth rate of
output per worker in PA &D and other
community, social and personal services might
have resulted from the downsizing of the public
sector because of privatisation and hikes in the
salaries of the central and state government
employees from time to time (i.e., due to
accounting reasons). Whereas productivity
growth in THR has derived stimuli from surge
in demand for such services with a subsequent
expansion in these activities. Part of the
productivity growth in the services sector might
be an outcome of application of IT services.
Despite increase in growth rate of labour
productivity in service sector, measurement of
service sector output and productivity are still
debatable issues.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Policy Measures for the Development of the
Services Sector</i></strong></div>

In post-1991 period, there were several
measures undertaken by the government to
develop services sector, especially through
deregulation of some sub–sectors of services
sector. Foreign direct investment (FDI) varying
between 26 per cent (in print media) to 100%
in information technology (IT) sector, business
process outsourcing (BPOs), e-commerce
activities, infrastructure, etc.) has been
permitted. There are several other promotional
measures taken by the government to sustain
the growth of the services sector. For example,
having realized that in knowledge- intensive
world driven by IT, integration with global
economy cannot take place without making
quality telecom services accessible at affordable
prices, a large number of steps like launching
of National Telecom Policy 1994, New Telecom
Policy 1999, Broad Band Policy 2004, etc were
undertaken. In addition to this, a number of
promotional measures have been taken up in
IT and ITES (Information Technology Enabled
Services) segment, trade, tourism, banking and
insurance and real estate sectors.
India has emerged as a top destination for
offshoring as per Global Services Location Index
2007. There is a lot of scope for future expansion
as only 10 % of the potentially addressable
global IT/ ITES market has been realized. The
remaining 90% (worth $300 billion) remains to
be tapped.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Problems/Challenges Ahead</i></strong></div>

The sustainability of impressive growth of
Indian economy has been questioned in the
wake of some challenges in the form of lack of
social infrastructure, physical infrastructure, IT
infrastructure, agricultural and industrial sector
reforms, rupee appreciation and US sub-prime
crisis, etc. Besides, challenges in the field of IT
and ITES like rising labour costs, rapid growth
in demand for talented manpower/quality
staff, high attrition rate, outsourcing backlash.
etc., are some other limiting factors. The growth
of IT and ITES is having social, economic,
health, ethical and environmental implications
also. Further, delay in the promotion of
conducive business environment and good
governance will enable us to catch up with the
global giants in terms of world-wide presence
and scale. It is also important to point out here
that the measurement of output, productivity,
non-availability of data or availability of data
after a time lag are other problems confronted
with in case of services . The problem gets
further compounded because of the entry of
new species of services (like IT, ITES, etc ) and
lack of development of concepts on the one
hand and non-inclusion of unpaid households
on the other. Further, quality of each unit of
the same service varies from the other.
Therefore, it is too difficult to achieve the same
level of output in terms of quality. Further,
quality improvements stemming from the
application of new technologies are extremely
hard to measure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Prospects for Growth in the Services Sector</i></strong></div>

One of the major drivers of service sector
growth in the post globalization era in India is
the IT and ITES sector. That is why NASSCOM
(2005) says that, “The IT and BPO industries
can become major growth engines for India, as
oil is for Saudi Arabia and electronics and
engineering are for Taiwan. Saudi Arabia’s oil
exports accounted for 46% of GDP in 2004;
Taiwan’s electronics and engineering exports
accounted for 17% of GDP in the same year.
…. India’s IT and BPO industries could account
for 10-12% of India’s GDP by 2015”
(NASSCOM). There is a huge potential for
growth in the services sector because of increase
in disposable income, increasing urbanization,
growing middle class, a population “bulge” in
the working age groups providing
‘demographic window of opportunity,’ and
emergence of a wide array of unconventional
/new services like IT, ITES, new financial
services (ATMs, credit cards) and tourism
services (eco-tourism, health tourism), etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

To sum up, the present paper provides a
brief overview of performance, prospects and
problems encountered by the services sector in
India’s economy. It is heartening to note that
India is called the ‘services hub’ of the world.
The traditional perception of India stands
changed today from a ‘land of beggars’, ‘snake
charmers’ and ‘cyber–coolies’ of yesteryears to
a ‘land of knowledge workers’ ---Thanks to IT
and ITES. Telecom and ITES-BPO revolution
have already marked their presence in India.
A number of sector specific measures have been
taken up by the government of India to promote
IT and ITES and other sun-rise sectors like
telecom, organised retail, hospitality,
entertainment and financial services sectors.
That is why the futurists are very optimistic
regarding the bright future and performance
ahead of the sector. That optimism is well
reflected in the following words of Mr Kamal
Nath, the then Minister of Commerce and
Industry which were a part of his speech at
World Economic Forum, “…. The question for
CEOs the world over is no longer “should my
company go to India?”, but rather “can my
company afford not to be in India?”. On the
tourism front, it is "Incredible India", but on 
the economic front, it is clearly, "Opportunity
India".
