<h3>Monetary & Fiscal Policy</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MONETARY POLICY</i></strong></div>

The use by the Central Bank of interest rate
and other instruments to influence money
supply to achieve certain macro economic goals
is known as monetary policy. Credit policy is a
part of monetary policy as it deals only with
how much and at what rate credit is advanced
by the banks. Objectives of monetary policy are:
accelerating growth of economy, maintaining
price stability, stabilization of exchange rate,
balancing savings and investment and
generating employment.
<br>
<br>
Monetary policy is generally referred to as
either being an expansionary policy, or a
contractionary policy, where an expansionary
policy increases the total supply of money in
the economy, and a contractionary policy
decreases the total money supply. Expansionary
policy is traditionally used to combat
unemployment in a recession by lowering
interest rates, while contractionary policy has
the goal of raising interest rates to combat
inflation.
<br>
<br>
The Reserve Bank of India announces the
Monetary and Credit Policy twice a yearOctober and April. October policy is called busy
season as it is the harvesting time for the kharif
season which used to account for the major
part of India’s agricultural operations This
policy determines the supply of money in the
economy and the rate of interest charged by
banks. The policy also contains an economic
overview and presents future forecasts.
The instruments of monetary policy are bank
rate, SLR, CRR and open market operations by
the RBI on the basis of repo and reverse repo
rates (buying and selling of Government
securities in the open market to regulate money
supply). Monetary policy works through
influencing the cost and availability of credit
and money.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tools of Monetary Policy</i></strong></div>

The tools available for the central bank to
achieve the above ends are: Bank rate, Reserve
ratios, Open market operations, Intervention in
the forex market and Moral suasion.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bank rate</i></strong></div>

Bank Rate is the rate at which RBI lends to
commercial banks. Bank Rate is a tool which
RBI uses for managing money supply and credit.
Any revision in Bank Rate by RBI is a signal to
banks to revise deposit rates as well as Prime
Lending Rate. It stands at 6% presently (2008
July)

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reserve Requirements</i></strong></div>

In economics, fractional-reserve banking is
the near-universal practice of banks in which
banks keep a fraction of the total deposits
managed by a bank as reserves and are not be
lent. The reserve ratios are periodically changed
by the RBI. The reserve requirement (or required
reserve ratio) is a bank regulation that sets the
minimum reserves each bank must hold as a
part of the deposits. These reserves are designed
to satisfy various needs like providing loans to
the Government (SLR) and inflation management
(CRR). They are in the form of RBI approved
securities (SLR) kept with themselves or cash
that is kept with the RBI (CRR).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Statutory liquidity Ratio (SLR)</i></strong></div>

It is the portion of time and demand
liabilities of banks that they should keep in the
form of designated liquid assets like government
and other RBI-approved securities like public
sector bonds; current account balances with
other banks and gold. SLR is aimed at ensuring
that the need for government funds is partly
but surely met by the banks. The commitment
of the Government to reduce fiscal deficit means
that it will borrow less and so the SLR was
progressively brought down from 38.5% in 1991
to 25% today.
<br>
<br>
The Reserves Bank of India Act, 1934 and
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 fixed the floor
and cap on SLR at 25% and 40% respectively.
But the amendment made in these statutes
removed the limits-lower and upper: RBI has,
as a result, the freedom to fix the SLR at any
rate depending on the macro economic
conditions. The amendment was an enabling
one.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR)</i></strong></div>

CRR is a monetary tool to regulate money
supply. It is the portion of the bank deposits
that a bank should keep with the RBI in cash
form. CRR deposits earn no interest
The Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and
the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 fixed the floor
and cap on CRR at 3% and 20% respectively.
But the amendment made in these statutes
removed the limits-lower and upper. RBI has,
as a result, the freedom to fix the CRR at any
rate depending on the macro economic
conditions. The amendment was an enabling
one.
<br>
<br>
CRR is adjusted to manage liquidity and
inflation the more the CRR, the less the money
available for lending by the banks to players in
the economy. CRR was 15% in 1991 and today
it is 8.75%. If inflation is high, money supply
needs to be taken out and so CRR is generally
increased. But in a regime of moderate inflation,
low CRR is in place.
<br>
<br>
RBI increases CRR to tighten credit for
example, CRR today (July 2008) stands at
8.75%-high because inflation is also at 13-year
high at 1.89% on WPI (July 2008). It needed to
be controlled by a variety of means one of which
was hike in CRR.
CRR as a tool of monetary policy is used
when there is a tremendous need to reduce
inflation and tighten credit as in 2008.
Otherwise, normally, RBI relies on open market
operations for liquidity management.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Open Market Operations (OMOs) of RBI</i></strong></div>

OMOs of the RBI can be described as:
<br>
Purchases and sales of government and certain
other securities in the open market (banks and
financial institutions) by the RBI in order to
influence the volume of money and credit in
the economy: Purchases of government
securities injects money. Into the market and
thus expands money and credit; sales have the
opposite effect – absorb excess
Liquidity and shrink credit. Open market
operations are RBI’s most important and flexible
monetary policy tool. Open market operations
do not change the total stock of government
securities but change the proportion held by
the RBI, commercial and cooperative banks.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ready Forward Contracts (Repos)</i></strong></div>

It is a transaction in which two parties agree
to sell and repurchase the same security. Under
such an agreement the seller sells specified
securities with an agreement to repurchase the
same at a mutually decided future date and a
price. Similarly, the buyer purchases the
securities with an agreement to resell the same
to the seller on an agreed date in future at a
predetermined price.
<br>
<br>
In India, RBI lends on a short term basis to
banks on the security of the government paper
(repo). Banks undertake to repurchase the
security at a later date-over night or few days.
RBI charges a repo rate for the money it lends.
It is 8.5% presently (2008 July)
Reverse repo is when RBI borrows from the
market (absorbs excess liquidity) with the sale
of securities and repurchases them the next day
or after a few days. The rate at which it borrows
is called reverse repo rate as it is the reverse of
the repo operation. Reverse repo rate presently
is 6% (July 2008)
<br>
<br>
The repo rate and reverse repo rate are 6%
and 8.5% respectively today (July 2008)
The Repo/Reverse Repo transaction can
only be done at Mumbai and in securities as
approved by RBI (Treasury Bills, Central/State
Govt securities). RBI uses Repo and Reverse repo
as instruments for liquidity adjustment in the
system.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Selective Credit Controls</i></strong></div>

Certain businesses can be given more and
certain others may get less credit from banks
on the orders of the RBI. Thus, selective credit
controls can be imposed for meeting various
goals like discouraging hoarding and blackmarketing of certain essential commodities by
traders etc. Either credit can be rationed or
interest rate can be hiked by RBI as a part of
SCCs. In SCCs, the total quantum of credit does
not change, but the amount lent and the cost
of credit may be changed for specific sector or
sectors.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Moral suasion</i></strong></div>

A persuasion measure used by central bank
to influence and pressure, but not force, banks
into adhering to policy. Measures used are
closed-door meetings with bank directors,
increased severity of inspections discussion,
appeals to community spirit etc.
Recently the RBI Governor appealed to
banks not to raise rates even though the central
bank was following a tight money policy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FISCAL POLICY</i></strong></div>

Fiscal policy refers to the policy related to
revenue and expenditure of the government
with a view to correcting the situations of excess
demand or deficient demand in the economy.
<br>
<br>
The instruments of fiscal policy are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Fiscal Instruments Related to
Government Expenditure: The government of
a country incurs various types of expenditure
such as expenditure on public works
(construction of roads, dams, bridges etc),
education and public welfare, defence,
maintenance of law and order, various types of
subsidies, and transfer payments to the public.
Government corrects the situations of excess
demand or deficient demand in the economy
by varying any or all types of expenditure.</li>
        <li>Fiscal Instruments Related to Financing
of Government Expenditure: Taxation, public
debt and deficit financing are the three fiscal
instruments related to financing of government
expenditure. Government can correct the
situations of excess demand or deficient demand
in the economy by using above mentioned
instruments.</li>
        <li>Fiscal Policy and Deficient Demand:
Following fiscal measures to correct the situation
of deficient demand:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Decrease in Taxes: Government
decreases taxes, which leaves the households
with more purchasing power and the firms with
more cash reserves. Direct taxes like income
tax, corporation tax etc are reduced. As a result
both households as well as investors will be
encouraged to spend more. Consequently,
demand will increase.</li>
        <li>Increase in Public Expenditure: To
stimulate the demand the government increases
expenditure over public health, education,
subsidies and transfer payments, and public
works. Public expenditure causes the level of
income to increase in economy. Higher level of
income causes high level of demand.</li>
        <li>Increase Deficit financing: Deficit
financing (by way of printing more notes for
additional expenditure) is increased during times
of deficient demand so that the overall level of
purchasing power is enhanced in the economy.</li>
        <li>Public Borrowing: Public borrowing is
reduced so that people are left with greater
disposable income.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Fiscal Policy and Excess Demand :
Excess demand generates inflationary pressures
in the system. Following fiscal measures are
taken to correct the inflationary situation.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase in taxes: Tax rates are increased
progressively to mop up additional purchasing
power within the economy.</li>
        <li>Decrease in Government Expenditure:
Government expenditure is reduced so as to
cause the demand to decline.</li>
        <li>Reduce Deficit Financing: Deficit
financing is greatly restricted. The printing of
more notes would only increase the rate of
inflation.</li>
        <li>Public Borrowing: The situation
demands less purchasing power with the
people. So, the government takes resort to
increased public borrowing.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Main Objectives of Fiscal Policy in India
The fiscal policy is designed to achieve
certain objectives as follows:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Development by effective Mobilization
of Resources :</b> The principal objective of fiscal
policy is to ensure rapid economic growth and
development. This objective of economic growth
and development can be achieved by
Mobilization of Financial Resources.
The central and the state governments in
India have used fiscal policy to mobilize
resources.
<br>
The financial resources can be mobilized by :-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Taxation: Through effective fiscal
policies, the government aims to mobilize
resources by way of direct taxes as well as
indirect taxes because most important source
of resource mobilization in India is taxation.</li>
        <li>Public Savings: The resources can be
mobilized through public savings by reducing
government expenditure and increasing
surpluses of public sector enterprises.</li>
        <li>Private Savings: Through effective fiscal
measures such as tax benefits, the government can
raise resources from private sector and households.
Resources can be mobilized through government
borrowings by ways of treasury bills, issue of
government bonds, etc., loans from domestic and
foreign parties and by deficit financing.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>Efficient allocation of Financial
Resources:</b> The central and state governments
have tried to make efficient allocation of
financial resources. These resources are allocated
for Development Activities which includes
expenditure on railways, infrastructure, etc,
whereas Non-development Activities includes
expenditure on defence, interest payments,
subsidies, etc.
<br>
<br>
But generally the fiscal policy should ensure
that the resources are allocated for generation
of goods and services which are socially
desirable. Therefore, India’s fiscal policy is
designed in such a manner so as to encourage
production of desirable goods and discourage
those goods which are socially undesirable.</li>
        <li><b>Reduction in inequalities of Income and
Wealth :</b> Fiscal policy aims at achieving equity
or social justice by reducing income inequalities
among different sections of the society. The
direct taxes such as income tax are charged
more on the rich people as compared to lower
income groups. Indirect taxes are also more in
the case of semi-luxury and luxury items, which
are mostly consumed by the upper middle class
and the upper class. The government invests a
significant proportion of its tax revenue in the
implementation of Poverty Alleviation
Programmes to improve the conditions of poor
people in society.</li>
        <li><b>Price Stability and Control of Inflation :</b>
One of the main objectives of fiscal policy is to
control inflation and stabilize price. Therefore,
the government always aims to control the
inflation by reducing fiscal deficits, introducing
tax savings schemes, Productive use of financial
resources, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Employment Generation:</b> The
government is making every possible effort to
increase employment in the country through
effective fiscal measure.</li>
        <li><b>Balanced Regional Development:</b>
Another main objective of the fiscal policy is to
bring about a balanced regional development.
There are various incentives from the government
for setting up projects in backward areas such
as Cash subsidy, Concession in taxes and duties
in the form of tax holidays, Finance at
concessional interest rates, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Reducing the Deficit in the Balance of
Payment:</b> Fiscal policy attempts to encourage
more exports by way of fiscal measures like
Exemption of income tax on export earnings,
Exemption of central excise duties and customs,
Exemption of sales tax and octroi, etc.
The foreign exchange earned by way of
exports and saved by way of import substitutes
helps to solve balance of payments problem. In
this way adverse balance of payment can be
corrected either by imposing duties on imports
or by giving subsidies to export.</li>
        <li><b>Development of Infrastructure:</b>
Government has placed emphasis on the
infrastructure development for the purpose of
achieving economic growth. The fiscal policy
measures such as taxation generates revenue to
the government. A part of the government’s
revenue is invested in the infrastructure
development. Due to this, all sectors of the economy get a boost.</li>
    </ul>
