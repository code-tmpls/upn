<h3>Parallel Economy</h3>

The Indian economy has continuously
recorded high growth rates and has become an
attractive destination for investments; but the
recent unearthing of corruption cases has thrown
light on the dark side of the growth that is rise
of the black money circulation in the economy.
In 1955, a study conducted by noted
economist Nicholas Kaldor showed that the
black economy accounted for 4-5 % of the
country's gross domestic product (GDP)
amounting to roughly Rs 600 crore. In 1969, a
panel headed by Justice Wanchoo recommended
several measures to streamline the taxation
system and estimated the size of the black
economy at Rs 7,000 crore. Since then, several
experts have undertaken various projects and
given their assessments of the problem. A study
conducted by the National Institute of Public
Finance and Policy under the chairmanship of
Raja Chelliah in 1980-81 showed that the black
economy accounted for 20% of GDP which
would now translate to about Rs 15 lakh crore.
A study by S.B Gupta in 1992 put the figure at
42% of GDP for 1980-81 and 51% for 1987-88.
Estimates by eminent economists reveal that
India's parallel economy has risen from a mere
3 percent of the GDP in the mid 50s to around
50 percent today.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS PARALLEL ECONOMY?</i></strong></div>

Black money or unaccounted money
circulating in the parallel economy is a big
menace to the economy. Thus it is necessary to
understand the concept of parallel economy.
According to Feige when economic activities
goes unreported or not measured by societies
current techniques to monitor economic activity
it falls under parallel or hidden economy.
Parallel economy connotes the functioning
of an unsanctioned sector in the economy. A
hidden economy in its broadest sense may
consist of - a) illegal economy, such as money
laundering, smuggling, etc; b) unreported
economy including tax evasion; c) unregulated
economy, ie economic activities outside
regulations.
<br>
<br>
Money laundering involves disguising
financial assets so that they can be used without
detection of the illegal activity that produced
them. Through money laundering, the launderer
transforms the monetary proceeds derived from
criminal activity into funds with an apparently
legal source. The most common types of criminals
who need to launder money are drug traffickers,
embezzlers, corrupt politicians and public
officials, mobsters, terrorists and con artists.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BRIEF HISTORY OF PARALLEL
ECONOMY IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

The Indian black economy is immense,
lucrative, widespread, and has grown
significantly since independence. The black
economy has grown from about 3% in the mid50s to 20% by 1980, to 35% by 1990, and 40% by
1995. As a percentage of GDP and at almost $1
trillion in absolute terms, the black economy is
larger than both the industrial and agricultural
sectors. Corruption is pervasive from the lowest
to the highest levels of public administration,
public enterprise, bureaucracy, judiciary, law
enforcement, and elected officials.
The history of corruption in India can be
traced to late 18th century British East India
company rule. The first governor-general of
India, Warren Hastings was notably impeached
on accounts of corruption in 1787. Though he
was acquitted in 1795, his lengthy trial brought
various aspects of illegitimate company activity
to light. The East India Company laid the
foundations of both a corrupt bureaucracy and
a parallel economy. During World War II, this
black economy experienced a surge. When large
quantities of products and resources were
allocated to the war effort, the general public
experienced acute shortages of daily necessities.
Scarcity, government controls, and private
hoarding stimulated the growth of the parallel
economy.
<br>
<br>
The most significant growth in the black
economy occurred during and after the 1960s.
Until this time, Gandhian and Nehruvian
politicians who had been part of the
independence struggle had largely administered
the government. As their careers ended, officials
who lacked their idealism, and were more likely
to engage in corruption and rent-seeking
practices, entered the government.
Today, corruption pervades the political
leadership, the bureaucracy, law enforcement
and the judiciary. Some of the most prominent
causes have been patron-client relationships and
communalism in the democracy, excessive
bureaucratic administration and low wages at
the bottom rung of public sector employment,
ineffective punitive and combative measures, and
a social environment conducive to corrupt
practices.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>REASONS FOR GROWTH OF BLACK
MONEY</i></strong></div>

There are several factors responsible for the
emergence of black money.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Controls and licensing system:</b>
The system of controls, permits, quotas and
licenses which are associated with
misdistributions of the commodities in short
supply results in the generation of black money.
Since considerable discretionary powers lays in
the hands of those who administered controls
this provided them with a scope for corruption –
‘speed money’ for turning a blind eye to the
violation of controls. All this gave rise to trading
in permits, quotas and licenses, malpractices in
distribution and in the process; it generated
sizeable sums of black money.
<br>
<br>
Price and distribution controls have in the
past led to the generation of black money on a
significant scale. Any price control without any
adequate machinery of distribution and speedy
arrangement for increasing supplies is
potentially a source of black money generation.
Similarly, the system of licenses requires large
number of inspectors for completing various
formalities and thus good amount of hush money
has to be paid. Where controls are not
implementable, they have led to harassment and
black money generation.</li>
        <li><b>Tax structure:</b>
High tax rates and defective tax structure
have also been responsible for the existence of
black money to a large extent. Till recently the
tax on income and on wealth was very high to
invite evasion. The marginal rate of income tax
was as high as 75 per cent. And when it was
combined with the tax on wealth, it was still
higher. This was the situation in respect of
personal taxation until a decade ago. The
corporate tax rate too was very high. In these
circumstances the temptation/gain from tax
evasion was substantial.
<br>
<br>
Tax-laws in country are so complicated that
a layman fails to understand it. Even honest
assesses are unable to file cor-rect returns. This
encourages people to evade tax.</li>
        <li><b>Donation to political parties:</b>
Black money also arises from political
activities such as elections where candidates
spend well above the ceiling prescribed by the
Election Commission. This huge expense in turn
makes them corrupt.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Government has decided to ban
donations to political parties in 1968; it prompted
businessmen to fund political parties, especially
the ruling party, with the help of black money.
Ostensibly, this decision was taken to reduce the
influence of big business on the electoral process,
but in practice what happened was precisely the
opposite. Businessmen everywhere have by now
learnt that they should pay a certain charge out
of the black money to the coffers of political
parties and then be sure that the political leaders
will only bark but not bite. Big business, in the
process, has been able to tame the political
leadership. This is evidenced by the relaxation
of various controls, permitting business houses
to enter areas reserved for the public sector,
putting a large number of banned items on the
Open General License list etc.
<br>
<br>
<b>Generation of black money in the public
sector:</b>
Every successive five-year plan is planned for
a larger size of investment in the public sector.
The projects undertaken by the public sector have
to be monitored by the bureaucrats in Government
departments and public sector undertakings.
Tenders are invited for the various works and
these tenders are awarded by the bureaucracy in
consultation with the political bosses.
<br>
<br>
Thus, a symbiotic relationship develops
between the contractors, bureaucracy and the
politicians and by a large number of devices costs
‘are artificially escalated and black money is
generated by underhand deals. Instability of the
political system has given a further momentum
to this process. Since the ministers are not sure
of their tenure and in a majority of cases, the
tenure is very short, the principle ‘Make hey
while the sun shines’ is adopted by most of them.
The larger number of scandals that are unearthed
by the Opposition only support the contention
that huge investment in the public sector is a big
potential source for black money generation. In
this process, bureaucrats act as brokers for
political leaders and thus the nexus between
business, bureaucracy and politicians promotes
the generation of black money.
<br>
<br>
<b>Deterioration in the moral and civic
standards:</b>
The most important reason of tax-evasion and
black-money is the genera deterioration in the
moral and civic standards of our people.
Our businessmen employ very ingenious
methods to generate black-money. Large
amounts of black-money can be generated
through the sale of fixed assets and scrap.
Sometimes influential firms obtain quotas or
import licenses in excess of their actual
requirements and sell them at cash premiums.
Industrial manufac-turing licenses are similarly
obtained through influences and sold to a second
party at an enhanced value. Purchase bills ore
over-invoiced or dummy bills are prepared.
Large-scale smuggling of gold and various luxury
items is an important source of black-money.
Sometimes, relatives whose income is not taxable
are kept on the payrolls of a company; they are
paid their salary which is taken back in the forms
of black-money.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IMPACT OF BLACK MONEY</i></strong></div>

The economic impact of corruption is a
powerful one. The circulation of black money has
adversely affected the Indian economy in several
ways.
<br>
<br>
In India, the black economy has resulted in
an immense loss of tax revenue. If it accounted
for 40% of GDP in 1998-99, the loss of direct
tax revenue at the prevailing rate would amount
to at least Rs. 200,000 crore, or 47.5 billion U.S.
Dollars (Kumar 1999). According to the BBC
(2004), only 2 million of India's billion people
pay taxes, just 2% of the population. The
government therefore suffers a perennial
shortage of funds and public services languish.
<br>
<br>
Because of the growing black economy,
policies fail both at the macro-level and the
micro-level. Planning or monetary policy or
fiscal policies do not achieve the desired results
because of the existence of a substantial black
economy. Targets for education, health, drinking
water and so on are not achieved because
“expenditures do not mean outcomes.” The
economy does not lack resources but faces
resource shortage. Much investment goes into
wasteful and unproductive channels, like
holding gold or real estate abroad. The flight of
capital lowers the employment potential and
the level of output in the economy. Capital sent
abroad does not generate output in India but
does so where it goes. A country that is
considered capital-short has been exporting
capital. A nation that gives concessions to
multinational corporations to bring in capital
loses more capital than it gets, and that too at
a high cost, from foreign institutional
investments or foreign direct investment. India's
policies are open to the dictates of international
capital because the country's businessmen and
politicians have taken capital out in large doses
since Independence. The costs are huge.
The direct and indirect costs are of policy
failures, unproductive investments, slower
development, higher inequity, environmental
destruction and a lower rate of growth of the
economy than would have been possible. It has
enormously worsened the income-distribution,
and has thereby undermined the fabric of the
fixed income salary class finds itself ever be the
lower rung of the income-ladder.
<br>
<br>
The inflation rises while the black money
circulates in the market. The price of eatable
/others goods are increased to supply of that
black money and less production of things
in the market. So people which have that
money they offer more price in the market.
As compared from other person in the
market.
<br>
<br>
At the social level, the cost is a loss of faith
in society and its functioning. At the political
level there is fragmentation, with States
demanding their own packages because the
belief that the nation as a whole can deliver
has been dented. The demand for smaller States
is a corollary because the bigger States neglect
the less vocal regions. Each caste, community
and region now wants to have its own party to
represent its narrow interest, leading to the
proliferation of smaller parties.
In the absence of Black Money India could
have been growing faster, by about 5 per cent,
since the 1970s if it did not have the black
economy. Consequently, India could have been
an $8-trillion economy, the second largest in
the world. Per capita income could have been
seven times larger; India would then have been
a middle-income country and not one of the
poorest.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INITIATIVES BY THE GOVERNMENT
TO COMBAT BLACK MONEY</i></strong></div>

Many steps have been taken by the
Government from time to time to check the taxevasion.
Following Wanchoo Committee's recommendations
the Government enacted the Taxation Laws
(Amendment) Act, 1975. This act has brought on the
statute vari-ous provisions for preventing tax-evasion
and proliferation of black-money Deterrent punishments
have been, provided for tax-evasion. The other
committees were—the Dangli Committee on Controls
and Subsidies (1980), The Rajah Chelliah Committee,
and the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy
(1985).
<br>
<br>
With a view of bringing about simplification
and rationalization of the direct tax laws, the
Government appointed a committee of experts
known as the "Direct Tax Laws Committee' in
June 1977. The recommendations of the Committee
are being processed for implementation.
In 1976 the Government imposed a
statutory obligation on the management to
carryout physical verification of its assets for
the satisfaction of the auditors to ensure that
no money is created through the sale of fixed
assets. Management is also obliged to maintain
a proper record of the sale of scrap.
Another step taken by the Government to
unearth black-money was the launching of the
voluntary disclosure scheme in 1975, No
penalties were impo-sed on the persons
disclosing black-money voluntarily.
<br>
<br>
Demonetization of the notes of higher
denomination has also been one of the recent
steps of the Government to unearth black-money. 
Curbing of the smuggling activities in
the country has been the main concern of the
Government, The conservation of Foreign
Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling
Activities Act was passed for this matter on
19th December, 1974.
<br>
<br>
In a bid to mop up black-money, the
Government announced on 12th January, 1981
a new scheme of issuing a ten-year bond of the
face value of Rs. 10,000 each. An ordinance for
this purpose was issued by the President. The
bonds were known as 'Special Bearer Bonds.'
The scheme gives immunity to the investor from
prosecution as well as disclosure of the source
of the money in-vested. Several other series of
such bonds have been released in recent years.
To tackle the menace of illicit funds, the
government has adopted a five-pronged
strategy. It comprises joining the global crusade
against ‘black money'; creating an appropriate
legislative framework; setting up institutions for
dealing with illicit funds; developing systems
for implementation; and imparting skills to the
manpower for effective action.
<br>
<br>
During the last two years, India has negotiated
19 new Double Taxation Avoidance Agreements
(DTAAs) and 17 new Tax Information Exchange
Agreements (TIEAs). In addition, 22 existing
DTAAs have been re-negotiated.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What is Double Taxation Avoidance
Agreement?</i></strong></div>

Double taxation refers to taxation by two or
more countries of the same income, asset or
transaction. India has adopted the system under
which Income Tax on residents is imposed on
the "total world income" i.e. income earned
anywhere in the world. Whereas the source of
income may be in some other country and that
country also claims a right to tax the income
arising in the country. The result is that income
arising to a resident out of India is subjected to
tax in India as it is part of total world income
and, also in host country which provides the
source for that income.
<br>
<br>
“In the case of non-residents, however, it is
not the "total world income" but only that
income is subjected to tax in India which is
earned in this country. Since a resident is taxed
in respect of foreign income in his own country
as well as in the country where it is earned,
he is subjected to tax in both the countries in
respect of the same income. The purpose of
double tax avoidance agreement is to avoid
such double taxation to the extent agreed
upon.
<br>
<br>
The DTAA provides that business profits will
be taxable in the source state if the activities
of an enterprise constitute a Permanent
Establishment (PE) there. The Agreement
provides for fixed place PE, building site,
construction & installation PE, service PE,
insurance PE and agency PE. Dividends,
interest and royalties & fees for technical
services income will be taxed both in the
country of residence and in the country of
source.
<br>
<br>
India also became a full member of global
economic body the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) last year in pursuit of its fight against
black money.
The government simultaneously has
strengthened its tax enforcement agencies like
the Income Tax department, allowing them to
create a new Directorate of Criminal
Investigation to probe illicit funds including
those stashed abroad. It has strengthened its
Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) to detect
suspicious transactions in economic channels.
India has recently signed the Convention
on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax
Matters, developed jointly by the Council of
Europe and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
<br>
<br>
All members of the G20 have now become
signatories but the Convention will have to be
ratified by the Indian Parliament to become law.
Tax evasion and illicit flows are a serious
problem and over the last two years, in order
to check this trend, India has negotiated 19
new double taxation avoidance agreements and
17 new tax information exchange agreements.
The Convention facilitates international cooperation for a better operation of national tax
laws, while respecting the fundamental rights
of taxpayers. The Convention provides for all
possible forms of administrative co-operation
between states in the assessment and collection
of taxes, in particular with a view to combating
tax avoidance and evasion. This co-operation
ranges from exchange of information, including
automatic exchanges, to the recovery of foreign
tax claims. However the Convention imposes
safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the
information exchanged.
<br>
<br>
Further India has signed an Agreement
with the Eurasian Group (EAG) to enhance
cooperation in curbing Money laundering and
Terrorist Financing. The agreement was signed
by Dr. Thomas Mathew, Joint Secretary (Capital
Markets) Division of the Department of
Economic Affairs.
<br>
<br>
The EAG is a Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) styled regional body with 9 members
including India, Russia and China and 29
observers of which 12 are countries and 17 are
international organisations. India was accorded
membership in the EAG in December 2010.
At the 15th Plenary meeting of the Eurasian
Group on Combating Money laundering and
Financing of Terrorism India has offered help
to member nations in enhancing their technical
skills in establishing better financial systems,
capital market monitoring and surveillance
through sophisticated IT tools. Help was also
offered in drafting legislation, law enforcement
techniques and strengthening of their respective
Financial Intelligence Units.


<div class="list-group">
    <div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">
    The EAG is soon emerging as an effective
body engaged in combating money laundering
and financing of terrorism.
Government proposes new measures to
tackle bureaucratic corruption
Government has suggested new measures to
check corruption at bureaucratic level. Under
the civil services code, penalties are divided
as major and minor. The major includes the
provisions of Reduction to Lower Rank;
Compulsory Retirement; Removal from
Service and Dismissal from Service. Whereas
minor penalties include: Censure;
Withholding of Increments; Withholding of
Promotions; Recovery of Pecuniary Loss.
<br>
<br>
The salient features of proposed guidelines are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>After even retirement proceedings against
corrupt government servants will not end.
The person will now have to face a 10 percent cut in pension in case of minor penalty.</li>
        <li>Major penalty of compulsory retirement
with full benefits will be changed to a
new provision of having a cut of 20 per
cent in pension.</li>
        <li>Cases will be solved using fast track
method. The intermediaries for
consultation in between will be eliminated
to increase the pace of solving the case.</li>
        <li>A cut in pension upto 10 per cent may be
imposed in case of minor penalty. This
cut will have a ceiling of five years as a
life-long reduction in pension would come
under the category of major penalty.</li>
        <li>There would be no cut in pension in those
cases of compulsory retirement of officers
being weeded out for non-performance.</li>
        <li>The departments and ministries will have
to appoint serving officers as Inquiry and
Presenting Officers to speed up the process
of proceedings.</li>
        <li>In important cases, the officers may
request the Central Vigilance Commission
to appoint their Commissioner of Direct
Inquiries as IO (Inquiry officers).</li>
        <li>The prescribed limit for sanctioning of
prosecution of public servants within 3 months.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
    </div>
    </div>


There had been umpteen talks and
voluntary disclosure schemes in the past for
checking evasion and black money, but no
perceivable results have come. Rather, the
quantum of black money in circulation has
increased substantially in volume. Recently the
government has been forced to commission a
study by three top economic thinks tanks to get
an estimate on the size of the black economy.
The study is expected to be over by September
2012 and provide fresh insights.
<br>
<br>
A major factor contributing to the increasing
level of black money are the tax havens. Tax
havens are those countries which has zero or
very low income tax, where no questions are
asked on origin of money coming into their
banks, which keep all banking records secrets
and cooperate very little with other countries.
During the years 2002-06, around $3 trillion
were deposited in such tax havens from the
developing countries. During the same period,
a sum of $136.5 billion Indian black money was
deposited. The most notorious of the more than
70 tax havens in the world is Switzerland. It is
estimated that the share in Swiss banks account
for almost a third of the total black money in
the world. Hence, it could be safely assumed
that some $45 billion out of the 136.5 billion
stashed away from India would have been
hoarded in Swiss.
<br>
<br>
India must summon the strength and
courage to bring back the money that is stashed
away in the tax havens. India can enter into
agreements with the foreign banks and
governments put the topic on a global agenda
and cooperate with other powerful countries.
This money belongs to the poor farmers and
unorganized workers of India. It is assumed
that, India will be in the top-five league if all
the ill-gotten money is brought back. It will
change the Indian scenario. It will change the
life of the common man.
