<h3>Money Laundering</h3>

Money laundering involves disguising
financial assets so that they can be used without
detection of the illegal activity that produced
them. Through money laundering, the launderer
transforms the monetary proceeds derived from
criminal activity into funds with an apparently
legal source. The most common types of
criminals who need to launder money are drug
traffickers, embezzlers, corrupt politicians and
public officials, mobsters, terrorists and con
artists.
<br>
<br>
Every year, billions of dollars are derived
from drug trade and are then reinvested
throughout the world by otherwise legitimate
businessmen, accountants and bankers and it
is the increasing awareness of the huge profits
generated from this criminal activity that has
created the impetus for governments to legislate
against such activities.
<br>
<br>
Money laundering is becoming very
protuberant with the passage of time. The
estimated amount of money laundered globally
in one year is 2 to 5% of the global GDP (or
USD 800 billion to USD 2 trillion).In December,
2012, HSBC Holdings Plc. had to agree to pay
a record USD 1.92 billion in fines to US
authorities for getting itself involved in moneylaundering issues.
The basic money laundering process has three
steps:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>PLACEMENT</i></strong></div>    
        
This is the first stage in the washing cycle.
Money laundering is a "cash-intensive" business,
generating vast amounts of cash from illegal
activities (for example, street dealing of drugs
where payment takes the form of cash in small
denominations). The monies are placed into the
financial system or retail economy or are
smuggled out of the country. The aims of the
launderer are to remove the cash from the
location of acquisition so as to avoid detection
from the authorities and to then transform it
into other asset forms; for example: travellers
cheques, postal orders, etc.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>LAYERING</i></strong></div>    
        
In the course of layering, there is the first
attempt at concealment or disguise of the source
of the ownership of the funds by creating
complex layers of financial transactions
designed to disguise the audit trail and provide
anonymity. The purpose of layering is to
disassociate the illegal monies from the source
of the crime by purposely creating a complex
web of financial transactions aimed at
concealing any audit trail as well as the source
and ownership of funds.
<br>
<br>
Typically, layers are created by moving monies
in and out of the offshore bank accounts of bearer
share shell companies through electronic funds'
transfer (EFT). Given that there are over 500,000
wire transfers - representing in excess of $1 trillion
- electronically circling the globe daily, most of
which is legitimate, there isn’t enough information
disclosed on any single wire transfer to know
how clean or dirty the money is, therefore
providing an excellent way for launderers to move
their dirty money. Other forms used by launderers
are complex dealings with stock, commodity and
futures brokers. Given the sheer volume of daily
transactions, and the high degree of anonymity
available, the chances of transactions being traced
is insignificant.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTEGRATION</i></strong></div>    
        
The final stage in the process. It is this stage
at which the money is integrated into the
legitimate economic and financial system and
is assimilated with all other assets in the system.
Integration of the "cleaned" money into the
economy is accomplished by the launderer
making it appear to have been legally earned.
By this stage, it is exceedingly difficult to
distinguish legal and illegal wealth.
Methods popular to money launderers at
this stage of the game are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the establishment of anonymous
companies in countries where the right
to secrecy is guaranteed. They are then
able to grant themselves loans out of
the laundered money in the course of a
future legal transaction. Furthermore,
to increase their profits, they will also
claim tax relief on the loan repayments
and charge themselves interest on the
loan.</li>
        <li>the sending of false export-import
invoices overvaluing goods allows the
launderer to move money from one
company and country to another with
the invoices serving to verify the origin
of the monies placed with financial
institutions.</li>
        <li>a simpler method is to transfer the
money (via EFT) to a legitimate bank
from a bank owned by the launderers,
as ‘off the shelf banks’ are easily
purchased in many tax havens.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IMPACT OF MONEY LAUNDERING ON
THE ECONOMY OF THE COUNTRY</i></strong></div>

Money laundering constitutes a serious
threat to national economies and respective
governments. The infiltration and sometimes
saturation of dirty money into legitimate
financial sectors and nations accounts can
threaten economic and political stability.
Economic crimes have a devastating effect
on a national economy since potential victims
of such crimes are far more numerous than
those in other forms of crime. Economic crimes
also have the potential of adversely affecting
people who do not prima-facie, seem to be the
victims of the crime.
<br>
<br>
For example, tax evasion results in loss of
government revenue, thus affecting the potential
of the government to spend on development
schemes thereby affecting a large section of the
population who could have benefited from such
government expenditure. A company fraud not
only results in cheating of the people who have
invested in that company but may also
adversely affects investors’ confidence and
eventually the growth of the economy.
The negative economic effects of money
laundering on economic development are
difficult to quantify, yet it is clear that such
activity damages the financial-sector institutions
that are critical to economic growth, reduces
productivity in the economy’s real sector by
diverting resources and encouraging crime and
corruption, which slow economic growth, and
can distort the economy’s external sector
international trade and capital flows to the
detriment of long-term economic development.
Developing countries’ strategies to establish
offshore financial centre (hereinafter OFCS) as
vehicles for economic development are also
impaired by significant money laundering
activity through OFC channels.
<br>
<br>
The negative effects of money laundering
activities may be on financial sector, real sector
of formal agents such as state, financial
institutions and banking sector.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Effect on financial sector:</b>
Financial sector may get negative effects of
money laundering especially financial
institutions including banking and non –
banking financial institutions (NBFIs),and
equity markets- may directly or indirectly be
affected. Basically,these institutions facilitate
concentration of capital resources from domestic
savings and funds from abroad. These
institutions provide impetus to furtherance of
investment prospects by providing conducive
environment and efficient allocation of these
resources to investment projects which contributes
substantially to long run economic growth.
Money Laundering impairs the
sustainability and development of financial
institutions in two ways:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly the financial institutions are weakened
directly through money laundering as there
seems to be a correlation between money
laundering and fraudulent activities
undertaken by employees of the institutions.
Similarly, with the increase in money
laundering activities, major parts of financial
institutions of a state are vulnerable to crime
by criminal elements. This strengthens the
criminals and other parallel system of money
laundering channels. This may lead to the
eviction of less equipped competitors & giving
rise to monopoly.</li>
        <li>Customer trust is fundamental to the
growth of sound financial institutions, and
the perceived risk to the growth of sound
financial institutions, and the perceived risk
to depositors and investors from
institutional fraud and corruption is an
obstacle to such trust.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>Effect on real sector:</b>
Money laundering adversely affects economic
growth through the real sector by diverting
resources to less productive activities and by
facilitating domestic corruption and crime.
Money laundering carried out through the
channels other than financial institutions
includes more “sterile” investments such as real
estate, art, antiques, jewelry and luxury
automobiles, or investments of the type that
gives lower marginal productivity in an
economy. These sub optimal allocations of
resource give lower level of economic growth
which is a serious detriment to economic growth
for developing countries. Criminals reinvest their
proceeds in companies and real estate with the
purpose to make further profits, legal or illegal.
Most of these investments are in sectors that
are familiar to the criminal, such as bar,
restaurant, prostitution. The real estate sector
is the largest and most vulnerable sector for
money laundering. Real estate is important for
money laundering, because it is a nontransparent market where the values of the
objects are often difficult to estimate and where
big value increases can happen and is an
efficient method to place large amounts of
money. The price increase in real estate is
profitable and the annual profits on real business
create a legal basis for income. The real estate
has the following features, which make it
attractive for criminal money:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>a safe investment</li>
            <li>the objective value is difficult to assess</li>
            <li>it allows to realize “white” returns.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Threat to Banking System</i></strong></div>
            
Across the world, banks have become a
major target of Money Laundering operations
and financial crime because they provide a
variety of services and instruments that can be
used to conceal the source of money. With their
polished, articulate and disarming behaviour,
Money Launderers attempt to make bankers
lower their guard so as to achieve their objective.
Though norms for record keeping, reporting,
account opening and transaction monitoring
are being introduced by central banks across
the globe for checking the incidence of Money
Laundering and the employees of banks are
also being trained to recognise suspicious
transactions, the dilemma of the banker in the
context of Money Laundering is to sift the
transactions representing legitimate business
and banking activity from the irregular /
suspicious transactions. Launderers generally
use this channel in two stages to disguise the
origin of the funds first, when they place their
ill gotten money into financial system to
legitimize the funds and introduce these funds in
the financial system and second, once these funds
have entered the banking system, through a series
of transactions, they distance the funds from illegal
source. The banks and financial institutions
through whom the ‘dirt money’ is laundered
become unwitting victims of this crime.
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES TO
COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING</i></strong></div>

Money laundering has become a crucial
crime and there are countless organizations
trying to get a handle on the problem. In the
United States, the Department of Justice, the
State Department, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and
the Drug Enforcement Agency all have divisions
investigating money laundering and the
underlying financial structures that make it
work.
<br>
<br>
State and local police also investigate cases
that fall under their jurisdiction. Because global
financial systems play a major role in most highlevel laundering schemes, the international
community is fighting money laundering
through various means, including the Financial
Action Task Force on Money Laundering
(FATF), which as of 2005 has 33 member states
and organizations. The United Nations, the
World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund also have anti-money-laundering
divisions.
</li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>FINANCIAL ACTION TASK FORCE
(FATF)/i></strong></div>    
    
The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is
an intergovernmental body that works for the
development of standards for combating money
laundering and terrorist financing. It also ensures
adherence to its standards by making sure that
countries across the world bring about legislative
and regulatory reforms in these areas. It further
monitors the progress of the anti-money
laundering efforts of its members. Forty plus nine
recommendations of FATF are considered as
global standards on Anti-money laundering and
combating of financing of terrorism.
<br>
<br>
Benefits of implementing the FATF
Recommendations:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Securing a more transparent and stable
financial system that is more attractive to
foreign investors: Corrupt and opaque
financial systems are inherently unstable.
Excessive money laundering can cause
increased volatility of international capital
flows and exchange rates, market
disparities, and distortions of investment
and trade flows.</li>
        <li>Ensure that financial institutions are not
vulnerable to infiltration or abuse by
organised crime groups: Financial
institutions that are exploited in this manner
are exposed to reputational risk, financial
instability, diminished public confidence,
threats to safety and soundness and other
losses.</li>
        <li>Build the capacity to fight terrorism and
trace terrorist money: Terrorists need
money to finance attacks. Tracing this
money is one of the few preventive tools
that governments have against terrorism.</li>
        <li>Meet binding international obligations,
and avoid the risk of sanctions or other
action by the international community: The
international community- through
numerous international treaties, United
Nations Security Council Resolutions and
best practices- has endorsed the FATF
Recommendations at the highest political
level.</li>
        <li><b>Avoid becoming a haven for criminals:</b>
Countries with weak AML/CFT systems are
attractive to criminals because they provide
an environment in which criminals can
enjoy the profits of their crimes and finance
their illicit activities with little fear of facing
punishment.
<br>
<br>
India became the 34th country member of
the Financial Action Task Force in 2010 . India
is also a signatory to various United Nations
Conventions which deal with anti money
laundering and countering financing of
terrorism.</li>

    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>BASEL STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES</i></strong></div>    
    
 On the financial front, the Committee on
Banking Regulation and supervisory Practices
issued the Basel Statement of Principles on the
prevention of criminal use of the banking system
for the purpose of money laundering in
December 1988.
<br>
<br>
The Statement of Principles does not restrict
itself to drug-related money laundering but
extends to all aspects of laundering through
the banking system, i. e. the deposit, transfer
and/or concealment of money derived from
illicit activities whether robbery, terrorism,
fraud or drugs. It seeks to deny the banking
system to those involved in money laundering
by the application of the following principles:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Know your customer - banks should
make reasonable efforts to determine
the customer’s true identity, and have
effective procedures for verifying the
bona fides of new customers (whether
on the asset or liability side of the
balance sheet)</li>
        <li>Compliance with laws - bank
management should ensure that
business is conducted in conformity
with high ethical standards, laws and
regulations being adhered to and
ensuring that a service is not provided
where there is good reason to suppose
that transactions are associated with
laundering activities.</li>
        <li>Co-operation with law enforcement
agencies - within any constraints
imposed by rules relating to customer
confidentiality, banks should co-operate
fully with national law enforcement
agencies including, where there are
reasonable grounds for suspecting
money laundering, taking appropriate
measures which are consistent with the
law.</li>
        <li>Adherence to the Statement - The full
text of this section of the Statement is
worth quoting in full.</li>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>UN CONVENTION AGAINST ILLICIT
TRAFFICKING IN NARCOTIC DRUGS
AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES (THE
VIENNA CONVENTION)</i></strong></div>    
    
This is one of the most important
international treaties in the past 50 years. It not
merely requires its signatory states to criminalise
the laundering of drug money, and to confiscate
it where found, but lays down so far as possible
a common wording for the criminal statutes,
and a common mode of enforcement. It also
requires full and prompt co-operation between
the signatory states for the enforcement of these
laws anywhere in the world. This agreement in
December 1988 commits all countries that ratify
it to introduce a comprehensive criminal law
against laundering the proceeds of drug
trafficking and to introduce measures to identify,
trace, and freeze or seize the proceeds of drug
trafficking. The UK was one of the first
countries to ratify this Convention which has
been ratified by over 50 countries.
This UN Treaty is of foundational
importance in relation to international 
cooperation in the area of drug trafficking. In the
European context alone, it exerted a major
influence on the Council of Europe Convention
on Laundering, Search, Seizure and
Confiscation of the Proceeds from Crime and
on the EC Directive on prevention of the use of
the financial system for the purpose of money
laundering. On a wider stage it has formed an
essential framework for the work of the FATF
and, indeed, implementation and ratification
of the treaty was the first of the
recommendations made by the FATF. Several
United Kingdom legislative provisions are taken
almost directly from the treaty.
<br>
<br>
The recitals narrate that the Parties to the
Convention recognise that links between illicit
drug traffic and other related organised criminal
activities which undermine the legitimate
economies and threaten the stability, security
and sovereignty of States; and that illicit drug
trafficking is an international criminal activity
that generates large profits and wealth, enabling
transnational, criminal organisations to
penetrate, contaminate and corrupt the
structures of government, legitimate commercial
and financial business and society at all its levels
and they are therefore determined to deprive
persons engaged in illicit traffic of the proceeds
of their criminal activities and thereby
eliminating their main incentive for so doing.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INITIATIVES TAKEN BY INDIA TO
COMBAT MONEY LAUNDERING</i></strong></div>

With its growing financial strength, India is
vulnerable to money laundering activities.
In India, before the enactment of the
Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2002
(PMLA- 02 hereinafter), the following statutes
addressed scantily the issue in question:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Conservation of Foreign Exchange and
Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974.</li>
        <li>The Income Tax Act, 1961.</li>
        <li>The Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act,
1988.</li>
        <li>The Indian Penal Code and Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973.</li>
        <li>The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Act, 1985.</li>
        <li>The Prevention of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1988.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

However, this was not sufficient with the
growth of varied areas of generating illegal
money by selling antiques, rare animal flesh
and skin, human organ, and many such varied
new areas of generating money which was
illegal. Money-laundering was an effective way
to launder the black money (wash it to make it
clean) so as to make it white. The international
initiatives as discussed above to obviate the
threat not only to financial systems but also to
the integrity and sovereignty of the nations and
the Hawala episode in India triggered the need
for an anti money-laundering law.
<br>
<br>
In view of the urgent need for the enactment
of a comprehensive legislation inter alia for
preventing money laundering and connected
activities, confiscation of proceeds of crime,
setting up of agencies and mechanisms for
coordinating measures for combating moneylaundering etc., the PML Bill was introduced in
the Lok Sabha on 4th August 1998, which
ultimately was passed on 17th January 2003.
Sec. 3 of PMLA defines offence of money
laundering as whosoever directly or indirectly
attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or
knowingly is a party or is actually involved in
any process or activity connected with the
proceeds of crime and projecting it as untainted
property shall be guilty of offence of moneylaundering. It prescribes obligation of banking
companies, financial institutions and
intermediaries for verification and maintenance
of records of the identity of all its clients and
also of all transactions and for furnishing
information of such transactions in prescribed
form to the Financial Intelligence Unit-India
(FIU-IND). It empowers the Director of FIUIND to impose fine on banking company,
financial institution or intermediary if they or
any of its officers fails to comply with the
provisions of the Act as indicated above.
<br>
<br>
PMLA empowers certain officers of the
Directorate of Enforcement to carry out
investigations in cases involving offence of
money laundering and also to attach the
property involved in money laundering. PMLA
envisages setting up of an Adjudicating
Authority to exercise jurisdiction, power and
authority conferred by it essentially to confirm
attachment or order confiscation of attached
properties. It also envisages setting up of an
Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals against the
order of the Adjudicating Authority and the
authorities like Director FIU-IND.
<br>
<br>
PMLA envisages designation of one or more
courts of sessions as Special Court or Special
Courts to try the offences punishable under
PMLA and offences with which the accused
may, under the Code of Criminal Procedure
1973, be charged at the same trial. PMLA allows
Central Government to enter into an agreement
with Government of any country outside India
for enforcing the provisions of the PMLA,
exchange of information for the prevention of
any offence under PMLA or under the
corresponding law in force in that country or
investigation of cases relating to any offence
under PMLA.

The regulatory purview of the Reserve Bank
extends to a large segment of financial
institutions, including commercial banks, cooperative banks, non-banking financial
institutions and various financial markets168.
The Board for Financial Supervision (BFS)
continued to exercise its supervisory role over
those segments of the financial institutions that
are under the purview of the Reserve Bank.
Recently, the RBI has issued a series of
master circulars to the banks, about the
precautions to be exercised in handling their
customers’ transactions. Important amongst
these is a guidance note issued about treatment
of customer and key to knowing the customer.
The identity, background and standing of the
customer should be verified not only at the time
of commencement of relationship, but also be
updated from time to time, to reflect the
changes in circumstances and the nature of
operations of the account.
<br>
<br>
RBI plays a significant role in AML activities.
RBI, recently blocked the application of Swiss
bank UBS for a banking license in India on the
ground that it was involved in $8 billion moneylaundering racket. RBI investigators found the
link between UBS and Khan, as the
businessman had deposited $8 billion at a Zurich
branch of UBS. They cited it as direct evidence
for blocking the license of the bank.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Role of Securities Exchange Board of India</i></strong></div>

Vulnerability of securities market to moneylaundering activities have been discussed in the
earlier part of this paper. Indian securities market
is also prone to money-laundering activities.
Intermediaries registered under the SEBI are
under reporting obligation of PMLA 02. FIUIND has also issued certain guidelines relating
to KYC to be followed by these intermediaries.
The main source of money-laundering would
be the Participatory Notes Transaction and
Overseas Direct Investment Routes.
The stock market regulator has undertaken
various initiatives to additionally safeguard the
existing Indian capital market regulatory system.
Sebi plans to review and consolidate various
initiatives undertaken by it and the government
over the period of time. The initiative is
necessary to overcome new challenges in rapid
technological and market advances.
All market intermediaries’ i.e. mutual funds,
brokers, depositories, merchant bankers,
portfolio managers and investment advisors are
required to adhere to specified client dealing
procedures like know your customer (KYC) and
mandatory requirement of PAN (Permanent
Account Number).
<br>
<br>
The existing Sebi guideline is based on the
Prevention of Money Laundering (PMLA) Act,
of 2002, which was further amended in 2005
and in 2009. However, Sebi plans to review and
consolidate it by taking into consideration the
new financial action task force (FAFT) standards.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CONCLUSION</i></strong></div>

Combating money laundering is a dynamic
process because the criminals who launder
money are continuously seeking new ways to
achieve their illegal ends. Many important
financial centers have now adopted legislation
to curb drug-related money laundering.
However UN data reveals that terror group
financing accounts for just 0.2 per cent of the
total $856 billion money laundered worldwide.
While this amounts to just $1.72 billion, this
