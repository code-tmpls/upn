<h3>World Economy</h3>

There are seven continents in the world viz,
Asia, Europe, Australia, Africa, North America,
South America (or Latin America) and Antarctica. The countries of the world are passing
through different levels of development. North
America, Western Europe, some East Asian
countries are developed countries whereas large
number of countries in Asia, Africa and Latin
America are developing countries, some of them
falling under the category of least developed
countries. The developing countries include
'eastern tigers', 'emerging market economies' and
many countries of the 'G-20'. It is, therefore,
important to know about them.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>North and South</i></strong></div>

The developed countries are concentrated in
the northern hemisphere whereas the underdeveloped countries are concentrated in the southern hemisphere. It is because of this reason that
the developed and underdeveloped regions are
euphemistically mentioned in economic literature as "North" and "South" respectively.
Though Asia, which contains many poor countries is in Northern hemisphere and Australia,
which is rich, is in Southern Hemisphere, by
and large this North-South categorization of
developed and underdeveloped countries indicates geographical concentration.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Third world</i></strong></div>

The notion of third world refers to underdeveloped or developing countries which remained
aloof from two cold war camps- Soviet Union
and the United States of America. The word
third world refers to those countries that remained non-aligned or neutral with either capitalism and NATO (which along with its allies
represented the First World) or communism and
the Soviet Union (which along with its allies
represented the Second World).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Least developed country (LDC)</i></strong></div>

Least developed country (LDC) is the name
given to a country which, according to the
United Nations, exhibits the lowest indicators
of socioeconomic development, with the lowest
Human Development Index ratings of all countries in the world. The concept of LDCs originated in the late 1960s and the first group of
LDCs was listed by the UN in its resolution
2768 (XXVI) of 18 November 1971. A country
is classified as a Least Developed Country if it
meets three criteria:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>poverty (three-year average GNI per capita
of less than US $905, which must exceed
$1,086 to leave the list)
• human resource weakness (based on indicators of nutrition, health, education and
adult literacy)</li>
        <li>economic vulnerability (based on instability of agricultural production, instability
of exports of goods and services, economic
importance of non-traditional activities,
merchandise export concentration, handicap 
of economic smallness, and the percentage of population displaced by natural disasters).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 
LDC criteria are reviewed every three years
by the Committee for Development Policy
(CDP) of the UN Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC). Countries may "graduate" out of
the LDC classification when indicators exceed
these criteria. The United Nations Office of the
High Representative for the Least Developed
Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries
and Small Island Developing States (UNOHRLLS) coordinates UN support and provides
advocacy services for Least Developed Countries. The classification (as of 1 January 2011)
applies to 48 countries.
<br>
<br>
Since the LDC category was initiated, only
three countries have graduated to developing
country status. The first country to graduate
from LDC status was Botswana in 1994. The
second country was Cape Verde, in 2007.
Maldives became the third country to graduate
to developing country status on 1 January 2011.
In 2011 the UN suggested that Equatorial
Guinea, Samoa, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu are
among the candidates for promotion from LDC
status. At the UN's fourth conference on LDCs
held in May 2011, delegates endorsed a goal
targeting the promotion of at least half the
current LDC countries within the next ten years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Developing country</i></strong></div>

Developing country is a term generally used
to describe a nation with a low level of material well being. These are countries with more
advanced economies than other developing nations, but which have not yet fully demonstrated
the signs of a developed country, are categorized under the term newly industrialized countries. A developing country, also known as a
less-developed country (LDC), is a nation with
a low living standard, undeveloped industrial
base, and low Human Development Index
(HDI) relative to other countries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Developed Nations</i></strong></div>

There is no single internationally-recognized
definition of developed country, and the levels
of development may vary widely within socalled developing countries, with some developing countries having high average standards
of living. Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations, defined a developed
country as follows. "A developed country is one
that allows all its citizens to enjoy a free and
healthy life in a safe environment."
Although, there are similar notions about developing and developed countries among the
multilateral organizations, they differ in their
methods of classification of developing and developed nations. While the UN does not give
any quantitative specification, the World Bank
and the IMF give some quantifiable basis of
difference.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE UN SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION</i></strong></div>

The United Nations Statistics Division says that
there is no established convention for the designation of "developed" and "developing" countries or areas in the United Nations system.
According to the United Nations, the designations "developed" and "developing" are intended
for statistical convenience and do not necessarily express a judgment about the stage reached
by a particular country or area in the development process. Thus, in common practice, Japan and South Korea in Asia, Canada and the
United States in northern America, Australia
and New Zealand in Oceania, and Europe, are
considered "developed" regions or areas. In
international trade statistics, the Southern African Customs Union is also treated as a developed region and Israel as a developed country;
countries emerging from the former Yugoslavia
are treated as developing countries; and countries of eastern Europe and of the Commonwealth of Independent States (code 172) in
Europe are not included under either developed or developing regions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE IMF SYSTEM OF CLASSIFICATION
OF DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES</i></strong></div>

The IMF uses a flexible classification system
that considers "(1) per capita income level, (2)
export diversification-so oil exporters that have
high per capita GDP would not make the advanced classification because around 70% of its
exports are oil, and (3) degree of integration
into the global financial system." From the IMF
criteria India, China, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Middle Eastern countries, almost
all the African countries fall under the category
of developing countries whereas G7 countries,
South Korea, Australia etc. are developed countries. Thus, according to the classification
from International Monetary Fund (IMF) before April 2004, all the countries of Eastern
Europe (including Central European countries
which still belongs to "Eastern Europe Group"
in the UN institutions) as well as the former
Soviet Union (USSR) countries in Central Asia
(Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan and Turkmenistan) and Mongolia,
were not included under either developed or
developing regions, but rather were referred to
as "countries in transition"; however they are
now widely regarded (in the international reports) as "developing countries".
The World Bank System of classification of
developing and developed countries.
<br>
<br>
The World Bank classifies countries into four
income groups. These are set each year on July 1.
Economies were divided according to 2008 GNI
per capita using the following ranges of income:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Low income countries had GNI per capita
of US$1,005 or less.</li>
        <li>Lower middle income countries had GNI
per capita between US$1,006 and
US$3,975.</li>
        <li>Upper middle income countries had GNI
per capita between US$3,976 and
US$12,275.</li>
        <li>High income countries had GNI above
US$12,276.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The World Bank classifies all low- and middleincome countries as developing but notes, "The use
of the term is convenient; it is not intended to
imply that all economies in the group are experiencing similar development or that other economies have reached a preferred or final stage of
development. Classification by income does not
necessarily reflect development status."

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Newly Industrialised Countries (NIC)</i></strong></div>

NICs are countries whose economies have
not yet reached First World status but have, in
a macroeconomic sense, outpaced their developing counterparts. Another characterization of
NICs is that of nations undergoing rapid economic growth (usually export-oriented).
Incipient or ongoing industrialization is an important indicator of a NIC. In many NICs, social
upheaval can occur as primarily rural, agricultural populations migrate to the cities, where
the growth of manufacturing concerns and factories can draw many thousands of laborers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Emerging Economies</i></strong></div>

In the 2008 Emerging Economy Report the
Center for Knowledge Societies defines Emerging Economies as those "regions of the world
that are experiencing rapid informationalization
under conditions of limited or partial industrialization." It appears that emerging markets lie at
the intersection of non-traditional user behavior,
the rise of new user groups and community
adoption of products and services, and innovations in product technologies and platforms.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Emerging Markets</i></strong></div>

The term emerging markets is used to describe a nation's social or business activity in
the process of rapid growth and industrialization. Originally brought into fashion in the
1980s by then World Bank economist Antoine
van Agtmael, the term is sometimes loosely used
as a replacement for emerging economies, but
really signifies a business phenomenon that is
not fully described by or constrained to geography or economic strength; such countries are
considered to be in a transitional phase between
developing and developed status. Examples of
emerging markets include China , India, some
countries of Latin America (particularly Argentina, Brazil , Chile, and Mexico), some countries in Southeast Asia, most countries in Eastern Europe, Russia, some countries in the
Middle East (particularly in the Persian Gulf
Arab States), and parts of Africa (particularly
South Africa). Emphasizing the fluid nature of
the category, political scientist Ian Bremmer
defines an emerging market as "a country
where politics matters at least as much as economics to the markets."

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BRIC Countries</i></strong></div>

In recent years, new terms have emerged to
describe the largest developing countries such
as BRIC that stands for Brazil, China, India
and Russia, along with BRICS (BRIC + South
Africa), BRICM (BRIC + Mexico) and BRICK
(BRIC + South Korea). These countries do not
share any common agenda, but some experts
believe that they are enjoying an increasing role
in the world economy and on political platforms. In economics, BRIC (typically rendered
as the "BRICS" or "the BRIC countries") is an
acronym that refers to the fast-growing developing economies of Brazil, Russia, India, China
and South Africa. The acronym was first coined
and prominently used by Goldman Sachs in
2001 before South Africa joined in 2011.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE WORLD BANK CLASSIFICATION
OF ECONOMIES</i></strong></div>

The World Bank classifies economies of the
world on the basis of Gross National Income
per capita for operational and analytical purposes.
Based on its GNI per capita, every economy is
classified as low income, middle income (subdivided into lower middle and upper middle), or
high income. Other analytical groups based on
geographic regions are also used. The World
Bank has identified following groups of countries on the basis of GNI per capita:
Income group: Economies are divided according to 2008 GNI per capita, calculated using
the World Bank Atlas method. The groups are:
low income, $975 or less; lower middle income,
$976 - $3,855; upper middle income, $3,856 -
$11,905; and high income, $11,906 or more.The
Bank's analytical income categories (low,
middle, high income) are based on the Bank's
operational lending categories (civil works preferences, IDA eligibility, etc.).
Geographic region: Classifications and data
reported for geographic regions are for lowincome and middle-income economies only.
Low-income and middle-income economies are
sometimes referred to as developing economies.
The use of the term is convenient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group
are experiencing similar development or that
other economies have reached a preferred or
final stage of development. Classification by
income does not necessarily reflect development
status.
<br>
<br>
Lending category: IDA countries are those
that had a per capita income in 2008 of
less than $1,135 and lack the financial ability
to borrow from IBRD. IDA loans are deeply
concessional-interest-free loans and grants for
programs aimed at boosting economic growth
and improving living conditions. IBRD loans
are noncessional. Blend countries are eligible
for IDA loans because of their low per capita
incomes but are also eligible for IBRD loans
because they are financially creditworthy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EURO ZONE</i></strong></div>

The eurozone, officially called the euro area, is
an economic and monetary union (EMU) of 17
European Union (EU) member states that have
adopted the euro (•) as their common currency
and sole legal tender. The eurozone currently
consists of Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia,
Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal,
Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. Most other EU
states are obliged to join once they meet the criteria to do so. No state has left and there are no
provisions to do so or to be expelled.
Monetary policy of the zone is the responsibility of the European Central Bank (ECB)
which is governed by a President and a Board
of the Heads of National Central Banks. The
principal task of the ECB is to keep inflation
under control. Though there is no common representation, governance or fiscal policy for the
currency union, some co-operation does take
place through the Euro Group, which makes
political decisions regarding the eurozone and
the euro. The Euro Group is composed of the
Finance Ministers of eurozone states, however
in emergencies, national leaders also form the
Euro Group.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>European Central Bank (ECB)</i></strong></div>

The European Central Bank (ECB) is the institution of the European Union (EU) that administers the monetary policy of the 17 EU
Eurozone member states. It is thus one of the
world's most important central banks. The bank
was established by the Treaty of Amsterdam in
1998, and is headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany. The current President of the ECB is Mario
Draghi, former Governor of the Bank of Italy.
The primary objective of the European Central Bank is to maintain price stability within
the Eurozone, which is the same as keeping
inflation low. The Governing Council defined
price stability as inflation (Harmonised Index
of Consumer Prices) of around 2%. Unlike, for
example, the United States Federal Reserve
Bank, the ECB has only one primary objective
with other objectives subordinate to it.
<br>
<br>
The key tasks of the ECB are to define and
implement the monetary policy for the
Eurozone, to conduct foreign exchange operations, to take care of the foreign reserves of the
European System of Central Banks and promote smooth operation of the financial market
infrastructure under the TARGET2 payments
system and the technical platform (currently
being developed) for settlement of securities in
Europe (TARGET2 Securities). Furthermore, it
has the exclusive right to authorise the issuance of euro banknotes. Member states could
issue euro coins, but the amount must be
authorised by the ECB beforehand (upon the
introduction of the euro, the ECB also had
exclusive right to issue coins). On 9 May 2010,
the 27 member states of the European Union
agreed to incorporate the European Financial
Stability Facility. The EFSF's mandate is to safeguard financial stability in Europe by providing
financial assistance to Eurozone Member States.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>2007-2012 GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS</i></strong></div>

The 2007-2012 global financial crisis is considered by many economists to be the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression of
the 1930s. It resulted in the collapse of large
financial institutions, the bailout of banks by
national governments, and downturns in stock
markets around the world. In many areas, the
housing market also suffered, resulting in evictions, foreclosures and prolonged unemployment. The crisis played a significant role in the
failure of key businesses, declines in consumer
wealth estimated in trillions of US dollars, and
a downturn in economic activity leading to the
2008-2012 global recession and contributing to
the European sovereign-debt crisis.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sub Prime Crisis</i></strong></div>

The U.S. subprime mortgage crisis was a set
of events and conditions that led to the late2000s financial crisis, characterized by a rise in
subprime mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures, and the resulting decline of securities
backed by said mortgages.The percentage of
new lower-quality subprime mortgages rose
from the historical 8% or lower range to approximately 20% from 2004 to 2006, with much
higher ratios in some parts of the U.S. A high
percentage of these subprime mortgages, over
90% in 2006 for example, were adjustable-rate
mortgages. These two changes were part of a
broader trend of lowered lending standards and
higher-risk mortgage products. Further, U.S.
households had become increasingly indebted,
with the ratio of debt to disposable personal
income rising from 77% in 1990 to 127% at the
end of 2007, much of this increase mortgagerelated.After U.S. house sales prices peaked in
mid-2006 and began their steep decline forthwith, refinancing became more difficult. As
adjustable-rate mortgages began to reset at
higher interest rates (causing higher monthly
payments), mortgage delinquencies soared. Securities backed with mortgages, including
subprime mortgages, widely held by financial
firms, lost most of their value. Global investors
also drastically reduced purchases of mortgagebacked debt and other securities as part of a
decline in the capacity and willingness of the
private financial system to support lending.
<br>
<br>
Concerns about the soundness of U.S. credit
and financial markets led to tightening credit
around the world and slowing economic growth
in the U.S. and Europe.
The immediate cause or trigger of the crisis
was the bursting of the United States housing
bubble which peaked in approximately 2005-
2006. High default rates on "subprime" and adjustable rate mortgages (ARM), began to increase quickly thereafter. Lenders began originating large numbers of high risk mortgages
from around 2004 to 2007, and loans from those
vintage years exhibited higher default rates than
loans made either before or after.
An increase in loan incentives such as easy
initial terms and a long-term trend of rising
housing prices had encouraged borrowers to
assume difficult mortgages in the belief they
would be able to quickly refinance at more favorable terms. Additionally, the increased market power of originators of subprime mortgages
and the declining role of Government Sponsored Enterprises as gatekeepers increased the
number of subprime mortgages provided to consumers who would have otherwise qualified
for conforming loans.
<br>
<br>
The worst performing loans were securitized
by private investment banks, who generally
lacked the GSE's market power and influence
over mortgage originators. Once interest rates
began to rise and housing prices started to drop
moderately in 2006-2007 in many parts of the
U.S., refinancing became more difficult. Defaults
and foreclosure activity increased dramatically
as easy initial terms expired, home prices failed
to go up as anticipated, and ARM interest rates
reset higher. Falling prices also resulted in 23%
of U.S. homes worth less than the mortgage
loan by September 2010, providing a financial
incentive for borrowers to enter foreclosure. The
ongoing foreclosure epidemic, of which
subprime loans are one part, that began in late
2006 in the U.S. continues to be a key factor in
the global economic crisis, because it drains
wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions.
In the years leading up to the crisis, significant amounts of foreign money flowed into the
U.S. from fast-growing economies in Asia and
oil-producing countries. This inflow of funds
combined with low U.S. interest rates from
2002-2004 contributed to easy credit conditions,
which fueled both housing and credit bubbles.
Loans of various types (e.g., mortgage, credit
card, and auto) were easy to obtain and consumers assumed an unprecedented debt load.
As part of the housing and credit booms,
the amount of financial agreements called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), which derive
their value from mortgage payments and housing prices, greatly increased. Such financial
innovation enabled institutions and investors
around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market. As housing prices declined, major
global financial institutions that had borrowed
and invested heavily in MBS reported significant losses. Defaults and losses on other loan
types also increased significantly as the crisis
expanded from the housing market to other
parts of the economy. Total losses are estimated
in the trillions of U.S. dollars globally.
<br>
<br>
While the housing and credit bubbles were
growing, a series of factors caused the financial
system to become increasingly fragile.
Policymakers did not recognize the increasingly
important role played by financial institutions
such as investment banks and hedge funds, also
known as the shadow banking system. Shadow
banks were able to mask their leverage levels
from investors and regulators through the use
of complex, off-balance sheet derivatives and
securitizations.
<br>
<br>
These instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in
bankruptcy, and contributed to the need for
government bailouts. Some experts believe these
institutions had become as important as commercial (depository) banks in providing credit
to the U.S. economy, but they were not subject
to the same regulations. These institutions as
well as certain regulated banks had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have
a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large
loan defaults or MBS losses.
These losses impacted the ability of financial
institutions to lend, slowing economic activity.
Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to take
action to provide funds to encourage lending
and to restore faith in the commercial paper
markets, which are integral to funding business operations. Governments also bailed out
key financial institutions, assuming significant
additional financial commitments.
<br>
<br>
The risks to the broader economy created by
the housing market downturn and subsequent
financial market crisis were primary factors in
several decisions by central banks around the
world to cut interest rates and governments to
implement economic stimulus packages. Effects
on global stock markets due to the crisis have
been dramatic. Between 1 January and 11 October 2008, owners of stocks in U.S. corporations had suffered about $8 trillion in losses, as
their holdings declined in value from $20 trillion to $12 trillion. Losses in other countries
have averaged about 40%.
Losses in the stock markets and housing
value declines place further downward pressure on consumer spending, a key economic
engine. Leaders of the larger developed and
emerging nations met in November 2008 and
March 2009 to formulate strategies for addressing the crisis. A variety of solutions have been
proposed by government officials, central bankers, economists, and business executives. In the
U.S., the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act was signed into law
in July 2010 to address some of the causes of
the crisis.
<br>
<br>
The bursting of the U.S. housing bubble, which
peaked in February 2007, caused the values of
securities tied to U.S. real estate pricing to plummet, damaging financial institutions globally. The
financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of valuation and liquidity problems in the
United States banking system in 2008. Questions
regarding bank solvency, declines in credit availability and damaged investor confidence had an
impact on global stock markets, where securities
suffered large losses during 2008 and early 2009.
Economies worldwide slowed during this period,
as credit tightened and international trade declined. Governments and central banks responded
with unprecedented fiscal stimulus, monetary
policy expansion and institutional bailouts. Although there have been aftershocks, the financial
crisis itself ended sometime between late-2008 and
mid-2009. In the U.S., Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In
the E.U., the U.K. responded with austerity measures of spending cuts and tax increases without
export growth and it has since slid into a doubledip recession.
Many causes for the financial crisis have been
suggested, with varying weight assigned by
experts. The U.S. Senate's Levin-Coburn Report
asserted that the crisis was the result of "high
risk, complex financial products; undisclosed
conflicts of interest; the failure of regulators,
the credit rating agencies, and the market itself
to rein in the excesses of Wall Street." Two
factors that have been frequently cited include
the liberal use of the Gaussian Copula function
and the failure to track data provenance.
<br>
<br>
The 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the
United States. Critics argued that credit rating
agencies and investors failed to accurately price
the risk involved with mortgage-related financial products, and that governments did not
adjust their regulatory practices to address 21stcentury financial markets.
In response to the financial crisis, both market-based and regulatory solutions have been
implemented or are under consideration. Paul
Krugman, author of End This Depression Now!
(2012), argues that while current solutions have
stabilized the world economy, the world
economy will not improve unless it receives
further stimulus. Buchanan, Gjerstad, and
Smith argue that fiscal and monetary policy
are ineffective, failing to reignite residential
investment and construction as they have in
past contractions. The current type of contraction requires balance sheet repair via currency
depreciation and export-driven growth. Fiscal
stimulus extends a current account deficit and
retards export growth. If the world economy
does not improve, many economists fear sovereign default is a real possibility in several European countries and even the United States.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EFFECTS ON FINANCIAL
INSTITUTIONS</i></strong></div>

Several major financial institutions either
failed or were bailed-out by governments, or
merged (voluntarily or otherwise) during the
crisis. While the specific circumstances varied,
in general the decline in the value of mortgagebacked securities held by these companies resulted in either their insolvency, the equivalent
of bank runs as investors pulled funds from
them, or inability to secure new funding in the
credit markets. These firms had typically borrowed and invested large sums of money relative to their cash or equity capital, meaning
they were highly leveraged and vulnerable to
unanticipated credit market disruptions.
<br>
<br>
The five largest U.S. investment banks, with
combined liabilities or debts of $4 trillion, either
went bankrupt (Lehman Brothers), were taken
over by other companies (Bear Stearns and
Merrill Lynch), or were bailed-out by the U.S.
government (Goldman Sachs and Morgan
Stanley) during 2008. Government-sponsored
enterprises (GSE) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
either directly owed or guaranteed nearly $5
trillion in mortgage obligations, with a similarly weak capital base, when they were placed
into receivership in September 2008. For scale,
this $9 trillion in obligations concentrated in
seven highly leveraged institutions can be compared to the $14 trillion size of the U.S. economy
(GDP) or to the total national debt of $10 trillion in September 2008.
Major depository banks around the world had
also used financial innovations such as structured
investment vehicles to circumvent capital ratio
regulations. Notable global failures included
Northern Rock, which was nationalized at an
estimated cost of £87 billion ($150 billion). In the
U.S., Washington Mutual (WaMu) was seized in
September 2008 by the USA Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). 
<br>
<br>
This would be followed by the
shotgun wedding of Wells Fargo & Wachovia
after it was speculated that without the merger
Wachovia was also going to fail. Dozens of U.S.
banks received funds as part of the TARP or
$700 billion bailout. The TARP funds gained some
controversy after PNC Financial Services received
TARP money, only to turn around hours later
and purchase the struggling National City Corp.,
which itself had become a victim of the subprime
crisis. As a result of the financial crisis in 2008,
twenty-five U.S. banks became insolvent and were
taken over by the FDIC. As of August 14, 2009,
an additional 77 banks became insolvent. This
seven month tally surpasses the 50 banks that
were seized in all of 1993, but is still much smaller
than the number of failed banking institutions in
1992, 1991, and 1990. The United States has lost
over 6 million jobs since the recession began in
December 2007. The FDIC deposit insurance fund,
supported by fees on insured banks, fell to $13
billion in the first quarter of 2009 That is the
lowest total since September, 1993.
Carl Levin and Tom Coburn committee
The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
(PSI) is the oldest subcommittee of the U.S. Senate
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs (formerly the Committee on Government Operations). The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations was created at the same time
as the Committee on Government Operations in
1952. On April 13, 2011 the Committee released
its report on Wall Street and the Financial Crisis:
Anatomy of a Financial Collapse. The 635-page
bipartisan report was issued under the chairmanship of Carl Levin and Tom Coburn and also thus
referred as the Levin-Coburn Report.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mortgage-backed security (MBS)</i></strong></div>

A mortgage-backed security (MBS) is an asset-backed security that represents a claim on
the cash flows from mortgage loans through a
process known as securitization. The process of
securitization is complicated, and is highly dependent on the jurisdiction within which the
process is conducted. The basics are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Mortgage loans (mortgage notes) are purchased from banks and other lenders, and
possibly assigned to a special purpose vehicle (SPV).</li>
        <li>The purchaser or assignee assembles these
loans into collections, or "pools".</li>
        <li>The purchaser or assignee securitizes the
pools by issuing mortgage-backed securities.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

While a residential mortgage-backed security (RMBS) is secured by single-family or two
to four family real estate, a commercial mortgage-backed security (CMBS) is secured by commercial and multifamily properties, such as
apartment buildings, retail or office
properties, hotels, schools, industrial properties
and other commercial sites. A CMBS is usually
structured as a different type of security than
an RMBS.
<br>
<br>
These securitization trusts include government-sponsored enterprises and private entities
which may offer credit enhancement features
to mitigate the risk of prepayment and default
associated with these mortgages. Since residential mortgages in the United States have the
option to pay more than the required monthly
payment (curtailment) or to pay off the loan in
its entirety (prepayment), the monthly cash flow
of an MBS is not known in advance, and therefore presents risk to MBS investors.
In the United States, the most common
securitization trusts are Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, U.S. government-sponsored enterprises.
Ginnie Mae, a U.S. government-sponsored enterprise backed by the full faith and credit of
the U.S. government, guarantees its investors
receive timely payments, but buys limited numbers of mortgage notes. Some private institutions also securitize mortgages, known as "private-label" mortgage securities. Issuances of
private-label mortgage-backed securities increased dramatically from 2001 to 2007, and
then ended abruptly in 2008 when real estate
markets began to falter.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN DEBT CRISIS</i></strong></div>

The European sovereign debt crisis is an ongoing financial crisis that has made it difficult
or impossible for some countries in the euro
area to refinance their government debt without the assistance of third parties. From late
2009, fears of a sovereign debt crisis developed
among investors as a result of the rising private
and government debt levels around the world
together with a wave of downgrading of government debt in some European states.
Causes of the crisis varied countrywise. In several countries, private debts arising from a property bubble were transferred to sovereign debt as
a result of banking system bailouts and government responses to slowing economies post-bubble.
In Greece, unsustainable public sector wage and
pension commitments drove the debt increase.
The structure of the Eurozone as a monetary union
(i.e., one currency) without fiscal union (e.g., different tax and public pension rules) contributed
to the crisis and impacted the ability of European
leaders to respond. European banks own a significant amount of sovereign debt, such that concerns regarding the solvency of banking systems
or sovereigns are negatively reinforcing.
Concerns intensified in early 2010 and thereafter, leading Europe's finance ministers on 9
May 2010 to approve a rescue package worth 750 billion aimed at 
ensuring financial stability across Europe by creating the European 
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF).
<br>
<br>
In October 2011 and February 2012, the
eurozone leaders agreed on more measures
designed to prevent the collapse of member
economies. This included an agreement
whereby banks would accept a 53.5% write-off
of Greek debt owed to private creditors, 
increasing the EFSF to about •1 trillion, and requiring
European banks to achieve 9% capitalisation.
To restore confidence in Europe, EU leaders
also agreed to create a European Fiscal Compact, including the commitment of each participating country to introduce a balanced budget amendment.
While sovereign debt has risen substantially
in only a few eurozone countries, it has become a perceived problem for the area as a
whole. Prior to May, 2012, the European currency remained stable. As of mid-November
2011, the euro was even trading slightly higher
against the bloc's major trading partners than
at the beginning of the crisis. Three countries
significantly affected, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, collectively accounted for 6% of the
eurozone's gross domestic product (GDP). During June 2012, the Spanish debt crisis became a
prime concern for the Euro-zone. Interest rates
on Spain's debt rose significantly and its ability
to access capital markets was affected, leading
to a bailout of its banks and other measures.
<br>
<br>
The European sovereign debt crisis resulted
from a combination of complex factors, including the globalization of finance; easy credit conditions during the 2002-2008 period that encouraged high-risk lending and borrowing practices; the 2007-2012 global financial crisis; international trade imbalances; real-estate bubbles
that have since burst; the 2008-2012 global recession; fiscal policy choices related to government revenues and expenses; and approaches
used by nations to bail out troubled banking
industries and private bondholders, assuming
private debt burdens or socializing losses.
Commentator and Financial Times journalist Martin Wolf has asserted that the root of the
crisis was growing trade imbalances. He notes
in the run-up to the crisis, from 1999 to 2007,
Germany had a considerably better public debt
and fiscal deficit relative to GDP than the most
affected eurozone members. In the same period, these countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy
and Spain) had far worse balance of payments
positions. Whereas German trade surpluses increased as a percentage of GDP after 1999, the
deficits of Italy, France and Spain all worsened.
Paul Krugman wrote in 2009 that a trade deficit by definition requires a corresponding inflow of capital to fund it, which can drive down
interest rates and stimulate the creation of
bubbles: "For a while, the inrush of capital created the illusion of wealth in these countries,
just as it did for American homeowners: asset
prices were rising, currencies were strong, and
everything looked fine. But bubbles always burst
sooner or later, and yesterday's miracle economies have become today's basket cases, nations
whose assets have evaporated but whose debts
remain all too real."
