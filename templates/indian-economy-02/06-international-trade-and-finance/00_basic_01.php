<h3>International Trade And Finance</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TRADE THEORIES AND
INTERNATIONAL FINANCE</i></strong></div>

The term International trade refers to the
exchange (exports and imports) of goods & services among nations. This process of exports
and imports involves two or more nations with
different national currencies. Therefore in order to make the exchange effective, some universally accepted currencies or precious metals
are used (other than the barter trade to settle
the transactions). The precious metals used are
generally gold and bullion whereas the universally accepted currencies are the national currencies of a few developed nations who have
substantial presence in the world trade and
hence their currencies are easily accepted by
trading nations. These currencies include U.S.
Dollars, Japanese Yen and European Euro, etc.
Since international trade worth billions of dollars takes place annually, it seems that there
exists some obvious mutual benefits to the trading nations. Different theories have been put
forward to explain their advantages which are
listed below:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Mercantilism: This was the first formal
writing on international trade, originated
during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. This line of thinking advocates that
the way a nation could become rich and
powerful was to export more and import
less. The resulting export surplus would
then be settled through inflow of gold and
bullion. Therefore this way, one nation
could gain only at the expense of the other.
This theory was later discarded by other
theories which stress that trade will benefit both the trading nations.</li>
        <li>Absolute advantage theory: This theory
was propounded by 'Adam Smith'. It says
that if a nation is more efficient than another in the production of a commodity
but is less efficient in producing a second
commodity, then both nations can gain by
each specializing in production of the commodity of its absolute advantage and exchanging part of the output with other
nation for another commodity. Thus in this
theory both nations gain unlike
mercantilist's view where in international
trade one nation can gain only at the expense of the other.</li>
        <li>Comparative advantage theory: This theory
propounded by David Ricardo in 1817, is
an improvement over absolute advantage
theory and is also till date regarded as the
most important and unchallenged law of
economics. It says that even if a nation is
less efficient (i.e. has an absolute disadvantage) than another in the production of both
the commodities there is still a basis for
mutually beneficial trade. The first nation
should specialize in the production and
export of the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is smaller (i.e its commodity of comparative advantage) and
import the commodity in which its absolute disadvantage is larger (i.e. its commodity of comparative disadvantage).
In the above table even though U.K is less
efficient in the production of both the commodity, it can trade by exporting cloth (as
its absolute disadvantage is smaller in cloth
vis-Ã -vis wheat) and importing wheat and
still both the nations would gain.</li>
        <li>Opportunity Cost Theory: Theory of comparative advantage has one weakness as
it takes labor as the only factor of production in the production of both the commodities and difference in the labor productivity as the cause of trade. However,
since labor is not the only factor of production, Haberler in 1936 propounded the
opportunity cost theory. It says that cost
of a commodity is the amount of a second
commodity that a nation must give up to
release just enough resources to produce
an additional unit of the first commodity.
Therefore for a 2 nation, 2-commodity
world, the nation with a lower opportunity cost in the production of a commodity has a comparative advantage in that
commodity whereas the other nation
would have a comparative advantage in
the other commodity. If we assume an
increasing opportunity cost economy, then
both the nations would specialize in the
production of their respective commodities (based on lower opportunity cost) until
the opportunity costs for both the commodities equalises in the two nations. Then
two nations can trade at an exchange rate,
which is mutually beneficial to the two
nations.</li>
        <li>Heckscher - Ohlin Theory: Whereas other
theories explained above assumed comparative advantage i.e. they do not explain
why labor productivity differs (in case of
Ricardo) or why opportunity costs differs
(in case of Haberler). The Heckscher -
Ohlin)theory propounded originally by Eli
Heckscher in 1899 (later developed by
Ohlin) tries to identify the basis of comparative advantage i.e. what cause differences in opportunity costs (or relative commodity prices when expressed in monetary
terms).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
H-O theory states that a nation should specialize in the production and export of the
commodity, which is intensive in the use
of its abundant factor. Thus in other words,
this means that a nation will have its comparative advantage on the commodity
which intensively uses its abundant factor. This will happen so because the relative factor price of the abundant factor
will be lower in that nation and given the
assumption of similar technology and similar consumer tastes and preferences, the
relative commodity prices will also differ
and this will form the basis of comparative advantage and international trade.
Thus, the H-O theory identifies differences
in factor endowments out of all other
possible factors, as the basis of comparative advantage and international trade.
One more extension of the Heckscher -
Ohlin theory is that International trade will
equalize the relative and absolute returns
to homogenous factor in the two nations.
Thus international trade serves to bridge
the gap in factor returns in different nations and acts as a substitute for International mobility of factors. This equalization will come through because differences
in relative commodity prices will force
trade among nations. As the nation with
the abundant factor will produce more of
the commodity which is intensive in the
use of its abundant factor, then demand
for the abundant factor will increase and
hence its relative factor price will increase,
opposite will happen iwith the other nation. This will bring in equality in the relative factor prices in the two nations and
later on will lead to equality in absolute
factor returns also.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BALANCE OF PAYMENT</i></strong></div>

Till now our discussion has been largely
focussed on real side of the international trade.
We discussed about the comparative advantages of the nations in terms of relative commodity prices and explained how international
trade brings about equalisation of relative commodity prices and relative factor prices. How-
ever, putting money values to these figures
involves some complication as international
trade involves more than one currency and
hence we need to explain the concept of
exchange rate, balance of trade, balance of payments, etc.
It is an accounting record of international money
flows (current as well as capital) of a nation with
the rest of the world. It records financial flows in
a specific period such as one year. Financial inflows such as receipts for exports or when a foreigner invests in the stockmarket, are treated as
credits or positive entries. Outflows such as payments for imports or the purchase of shares on a
foreign stock market are debits or negative entries. The accounts are double entry and hence
they are always equal. For eg. the export of goods
involves the receipt of cash (credit) which represents a claim on another country (the debit). Thus
by definition, the balance of payments must
balance.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Components of Balance of Payments</i></strong></div>

The format of the balance of payments
given below shows the important types of
transactions that enter the balance of payments.
<br>
<b>Balance of trade (BOT)</b>
= Net visibles
<br>
= Export of visibles minus import of visibles
<br>
= Export of goods - Import of goods Balance of payment
<br>
= BOT + Net Invisibles
<br>
= BOT + (Export of Services - Import of Services)

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Current Accounts</i></strong></div>

The current account consists of two major
items, namely (a) merchandise (goods) exports
and imports; and (b) invisible (services such as
transport, shipping, Banking, insurance, rent,
profit and interest etc.) exports and imports.
Capital Account
The capital account consists of short-term and longterm capital transactions. Capital outflows represents debit and capital inflow represents credit. It
must, however, be noted that payment and receipt on loans and dividend are recorded on current account since they are really payments for the
services of capital during a particular period.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Unilateral Transfer Account</i></strong></div>

Unilateral transfers are another term for gifts,
and include private remittances, government
grants, repatriations and disaster relief. Unilateral payments received from abroad are credits
and those made abroad are debits. These are
often accounted for in the invisible accounts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Official Reserve Account</i></strong></div>

Official reserves represent the holdings by
the government in the form of foreign currency
and securities and gold. The official reserves
usually consist of such assets only which are
accepted as a means of international payments.
Official reserves refer to the Gold and foreign currencies held by the government. It indicates a country's ultimate ability to pay for
imports and signals pressures on the balance of
payments. They are presented as a nominal
value at the day, month and/or year end. A
general yardstick is that a nation should have,
on an average, official reserves sufficient to
cover three months' imports. Changes in the
level of official reserves suggest foreign exchange
intervention and therefore indicated pressures
on the currency. A fall in the reserves suggests
that there was intervention to offset currency
weakness whereas a rise suggests intervention
to hold the currency down. The central bank
intervention gave rise to a new term called sterilization:- It is defined as follows. When a central bank sells reserves and purchases its own
currency, the domestic money supply is reduced
in size by the amount of domestic currency
swallowed up by the bank. On the other hand
purchases of foreign currency boost the money
supply. Such intervention is sterilized. Central
Bank neutralizes the effect on the money supply with some other action, such as the purchase or sale of government bonds.
Balance of Trade and Balance of Payment
Balance of Trade - takes into account only
those transactions arising out of the exports and
imports of the visible items, it does not consider
the exchange of invisible items.
<br>
<br>
Visible items refer to merchandise or trade
in goods only. Therefore balance of trade refers
to net exports of goods.
<br>
<b>Balance of trade</b> = Export of goods - Import
of goods.
<br>
<br>
Invisible items refer to trade in services plus
various payments and receipts in the form of
rents, interest, profits and dividends. Trade in
services includes payments and receipts regarding Banking, shipping and insurance. Invisibles
also include expenditure by tourists and gifts
and unilateral remittances by the nationals of a
country working abroad.
<br>
<br>
Balance of payments takes into account the
exchange of both the visible and invisible items.
So to say
<br>
<b>Balance of payments</b> = Balance of Trade + net
invisibles.
<br>
<br>
This represents comprehensive picture of a
country's economic and financial transactions
with the economic and financial transactions
of the rest of the world than the balance of
trade.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Balance of Payments Crisis</i></strong></div>

As bills must be paid, ultimately a country's
accounts must balance (although because real
life is never that neat a balancing item is usually inserted to cover up the inconsistencies).
"Balance of payments crisis" is a politically
charged phrase. But a country can often sustain a current account deficit for many years
without its economy suffering, because any
deficit is likely to be tiny compared with the
country's National Income and wealth. Indeed,
if the deficit is due to firms importing technology and other capital goods from abroad, which
will improve their productivity, the economy
may benefit. A deficit that has to be financed
by the public sector may be more problematic,
particularly if the public sector faces limits on
how much it can raise taxes or borrow or has
few financial reserves. For instance, when the
Russian government failed to pay the interest
on its foreign DEBT in August 1998 it found it
impossible to borrow any more money in the
international financial markets. Nor was it able
to increase taxes in its collapsing economy or to
find anybody within Russia willing to lend it
money. That truly was a balance of payments
crisis.
<br>
<br>
In the early years of the 21st century, economists started to worry that the United States
would find itself in a balance of payments crisis. Its current account deficit grew to over 5%
of its GDP, making its economy increasingly
reliant on foreign CREDIT.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Terms of trade</i></strong></div>

It refers to the ratio of export prices to import
prices. It measures the volume of imports that
can be bought with one unit of exports. It is presented as index numbers. An improvement in the
nation's terms of trade indicates that export earnings will buy more imports but its effect on trade
balance or BOP will depend on many other related factors. Terms of trade are said to improve
if export prices rise more highly or fall more slowly
than import prices. Typically, an exchange rate
devaluation or depreciation increases import
prices relative to export prices and causes the
terms of trade to deteriorate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EXCHANGE RATE</i></strong></div>

Exchange rate is the amount of the national
currency required by a nation to purchase one
unit of foreign currency say US Dollar. Since
most of the international trade that takes place
today is in money terms exchange rates have
an important influence on the flow of 
international trade. Two types of exchange 
rate regimes exist in the contemporary world today: -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed exchange rate.</li>
        <li>Floating/Fluctuating exchange rate.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In the fixed exchange rate, the exchange rate
of the national currency is fixed and tied to
another universally accepted foreign currency
say US Dollar. The Central Bank of the nation
stands ready to purchase and sell the foreign
currency to keep the exchange rate fixed. In
the case of fluctuating exchange rate, exchange
rate is determined by the demand and supply
of foreign exchange by the nationals of a country. 
The exchange rate appreciates or depreciates, depending 
on the market forces of demand and supply. This in turn has an impact
on the competitive position of the economy. A
devaluation/depreciation of a nation's currency
may decrease imports and increase exports to
help improve the foreign exchange position of
the nation. This is measured and reflected in
Balance of Payments position of the nation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Different Exchange Rate Regimes
Gold Standard:</b> Before 1914, exchange rates were
fixed in terms of gold, Trade was mainly in
physical goods and capital flows were limited.
A country, which developed a deficit on its current account, would first consume its reserves of
foreign currencies. Then it would have to pay
for the imports by shipping gold. The transfer of
gold would reduce the money supply in the
deficit country since currencies were then backed
by convertibility into gold. The contracting
money supply in the deficit country would reduce prices and output and hence would lower
its imports. The opposite will happen in the
surplus country and thus the current account
would automatically return to equilibrium. This
system got out of balance in 1920's and was
abandoned by early 1930's.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Flexible/Floating Exchange Rate</i></strong></div>

After breaking down of gold standard and
the end of World War II, an international conference was convened in America at Bretton
Woods, New Hampshire in June 1944. The participants vowed to form the IMF and the World
Bank and the major currencies were fixed in
relation to the dollar (Pegging). Fluctuations
were allowed to the extent of 1% on either side.
In addition, the American Government agreed
to buy gold on demand at $35 per ounce. However, this pegged Bretton Woods system broke
by the 1970's. Persistent American deficits had
led to an international excess of dollars and
American gold reserves came under pressure.
In 1971, Americans suspended the convertibility of the dollar into gold. Major currencies of
the world were allowed to float against each
other depending on the demand and supply.
Since then exchange rates are largely floating
and are determined by the market.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>How exchange Rate is fixed in India</i></strong></div>

The Exchange rate of Indian rupee is determined on the basis of a basket of currencies,
which comprises currencies of its main trading
partners as well as world economic powers such
as the USA, the U.K., France, Japan, Germany,
etc. In India foreign exchange rates are now
completely market determined, i.e Indian exchange rate is floating exchange rate. Today
Rupee is fully convertible on current account
i.e. no prior approval of RBI is required to
import goods and services except those in the
negative list. However, capital account convertibility has till date remained a ticklish issue and
it has not been permitted till now. The movement of capital is today regulated through Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) 1999.
The Tarapore Committee set up to study the
procedure for the same recommended a phased
programme over the three-year period and to
achieve the preconditions for CAC. At present
RBI intervenes only occasionally in the market
to prevent any substantial diversion of the exchange rate from the fundamental levels.
<br>
<br>
As to what determines the exchange rate,
no neat explanation can be given for the same,
but two leading theories put forward are:-
(i) Purchasing Power parity (ii) Investment Portfolios theory. Purchasing Power Parity is defined as the exchange rate, which equates the
prices of a basket of goods and services in two
countries. In the long run it is argued that currencies should move towards their PPP. Big Mac
Index is one of the ways to ascertain PPP
among nations. The portfolio approach suggests
that exchange rates move to balance total returns (interest + expected exchange rate movements) among nations.
Effective Exchange rate (EER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER)
There exist different versions of Exchange
rates, including nominal exchange rate (which
we have discussed so far).
<br>
<br>
EER is the average exchange rate against a
basket of currencies, with which the nation
trades. It is presented as index numbers.
REER measures the competitiveness of a national currency against the basket of currencies
with which the nation trades.
Thus the exchange rate regime in India is a
managed float with the nominal exchange
rate(against a basket of currencies) targeted to
achieving the real exchange rate which yields a
sustainable current account deficit.
Foreign Exchange Market: It is a market where
one country's currency can be exchanged for
another country's. It is not a geographic location; instead it is an informal network of telephone, telex, facsimile and computer communications between banks, foreign exchange dealers - arbitrageurs and speculators. The market
operates simultaneously at three tiers:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Individuals and corporations buy and sell
foreign exchange through their commercial banks.</li>
        <li>Commercial banks trade in foreign exchange with other commercial banks in
the same financial centre.</li>
        <li>Commercial banks trade in foreign exchange with commercial banks in other
financial centres.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Foreign exchange market consists of a spot
market and forward market. In the sport market, foreign currencies are sold and bought for
delivery within two business days after the day
of a trade. In the forward market, foreign currencies are sold or brought for future delivery.
There are many types of participants in the
foreign exchange market. They include exporters, governments, importers, multinational companies, tourists, commercial banks and central
banks. However large commercial banks and
central banks are the two major participants in
the foreign exchange market.
<br>
<br>
In the foreign exchange market, foreign exchange quotations are made in terms of number of units of local currency required to buy
one unit of a foreign country. Hence India quotes
its exchange rates in rupees, which can be exchanged for one unit of foreign exchange for
example Rs. 46.50/$. This means that we require Rs. 46.50 to get one unit of US $. Practically all-major newspapers in the world print a
daily list of exchange rates.
Cross rates: Most currencies are traded against
the US dollar, but at times exporters and importers need to know the exchange rate between two non-U.S. currencies. For example,
the exchange rate between Indian Rupee and
Korean Won. Because most currency pairs are
not traded actively, their exchange rate is determined through their relationship to a widely
traded third currency such as the U.S. dollars.
The type of exchange rate desired here is known
as the cross-rate.
<br>
<br>
The exchange rate quotations in the forward
market are made either "outright" or in terms
of the spread on the spot rate. For e.g. a trader
may buy the 90-days outright forward quotation as Rs. 46.75/ $ 1 or through spread on
the spot rate in terms of basis points (one basis
point - 0.01per cent)
<br>
<br>
Currency futures and options market: Currency futures market is just like the currency
forward market except that trade in the future
market is done in standard units and only in
the future market where forward market is an
informal market in which contracting parties
enter into a tailor made agreement for exchange
rate.
<br>
<br>
Currency options market: Currency option is
simply a contract that gives the holder the right
to buy or sell any foreign currency at a specified price during a specified period. Whereas
the currency options do not necessarily need to
be exercised at maturity, payment and delivery
in futures contracts are required at maturity.
Different participants in the foreign exchange
market enter into spot & forward/futures contract for different reasons. The reasons include
arbitrage, hedging or risk avoidance and speculation.
Arbitrage: Arbitrage is the purchase of an asset
or a commodity in one market and its sale in
another market to take advantage of a price differential. Professional arbitrageurs quickly transfer funds from one currency to another in order
to profit from discrepancies between exchange
rates in different markets. The process of arbitrage also works through the foreign exchange
market to bring interest in national markets together.
Hedgers: They enter into forward/future contracts to eliminate possible exchange losses on
export and import orders denominated in foreign
currencies. Hedgers mostly MNCs, engage in forward contract to protect the home currency value
of foreign-currency denominted assets and liabilities. This way they insulate themselves from fluctuations in the foreign exchange market and are
able to focus on the core areas of operation.
Speculations: Deliberately expose themselves
to exchange risk by engaging in forward contracts in order to make a profit from exchange
fluctuations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC INTEGRATION</i></strong></div>

The term economic integration refers to the kind
of arrangement between two or more trading
countries that remove artificial trade barriers
such as tariff and quotas between them. In fact
the term economic integration is a broad and
general term, which covers several kinds of arrangement by which two or more countries
mutually agree to draw their economies closer
in terms of trade, investment and other kinds
of economic cooperation. In a very developed
kind of arrangement for economic integration,
the countries may agree to integrate their social
and national policies as well. If we consider
the level of integration in ascending order, there
are various kinds of economic integration such
as Free Trade Area, Customs Union, Common
Market and Economic Union.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Forms of Economic Integration</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Free Trade Area: A Free Trade Area (FTA)
is a grouping of the countries to bring about
free trade between them. The FTA abolishes all restrictions on trade among the
members but each member is left free to
determine its own commercial policy with
non- members. There are many examples
of FTA, which are operational at present.
North Atlantic Free Trade area (NAFTA)
is one such arrangement among the USA,
Mexico and Canada. There is an FTA between Singapore and Japan. India has also
FTAs with Sri Lanka and Thailand.</li>
        <li>Customs Union: A customs Union is a
more advanced level of economic integration than the FTA. It not only eliminates
all restrictions on trade among member
countries, but also adopts a uniform commercial policy against the non- members.
The European union started as a customs
union.</li>
        <li>Common Market: The Common market is
a step ahead of the Customs Union. A
common Market allows free movement of
labour and capital within the Common
Market, besides having the two characteristics of the Customs Union, namely,
free trade among members and uniform
tariff policy towards non-members. In its
earlier stage European Union was like a
Common Market.</li>
        <li>Economic Union: It is the most advanced
level of integration. This satisfies the conditions of the Common Market and additionally it also achieves some degree of harmonization of national economic policies.
The European Union is a living example
of this kind of arrangement, which requires
all its members to abide by certain monetary and fiscal disciplines along with some
harmonization in social and political arena.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What is Convertibility?</i></strong></div>

When one currency is freely exchangeable
with another in the market, this attribute is
referred to as convertibility. In a convertible exchange rate regime we can purchase another
currency by paying in with our currency at the
market exchange rate.
<br>
<br>
Convertibility of a currency may be full or
partial. Full float of a currency in the exchange
market vis-Ã -vis other currencies for the determination of exchange rate is practiced by the
developed nations. The developing countries like
India usually adopt a policy of "managed float"
or "partial float" (sometimes referred to as dirty
float as well). India's exchange rate was determined through managed float till 1992. Before
India adopted what we call Liberalised Exchange Rate Management System (LERMS) in
1992, the exchange rate of Rupee was determined by the Reserve Bank of India on the basis
of a basket of currencies. In LERMS, or Partial
Convertibility 60% of foreign currency holding
was permitted to be converted on the market
rate whereas remaining 40% on official rate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Full Convertibility on Trade A/C</i></strong></div>

A unified exchange rate was introduced in
1993 & 1994 budgets through the provision of
full convertibility of rupee on trade account
under the unified exchange rate regime; the
60:40 ratio was extended to 100 per cent conversion. This 100 per cent conversion was extended to almost the entire merchandise trade
transactions (i.e. export and import of goods);
and all receipts, whether on current or capital account of balance of payments (BOP),
but not all payments.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Full Convertibility on Current Account</i></strong></div>

In February 1994, the RBI undertook several
steps towards achieving full convertibility of
Current A/c. India achieved full convertibility
on current A/c on 19the August, 1994, when
the RBI further liberalized its exchange rate
system of the IMF, under which India is committed to forsake the 
use of exchange restrictions on current international transactions as
an instrument in managing the BOP. The transactions under current account may be one of
the following:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>All payments due in connection with foreign
trade, current business, including services and
normal short-term banking and credit facilities.</li>
        <li>Payments due as interest on loans and as net
income from other investments.</li>
        <li>Payments of moderate amount of amortisation of loans or 
for depreciation or direct investments.</li>
        <li>Moderate remittance for family living expenses.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Full Convertibility on Capital Account</i></strong></div>

Capital account convertibility refers to easy
and free conversion of a currency, say rupee,
in dollars for loan and investment purposes.
India has so far not allowed full conversion on
capital account because the health of financial
sector in India is not considered strong enough
for this. A committee called the Tarapore Committee was formed five years back at the behest
of the international lending community and proreformists to suggest a roadmap for CAC. Transactions in the capital account may include giving and taking Loans and credits, investing for
speculative purposes, etc. among others.
<br>
<br>
Main Advantages of capital account convertibility
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Smooth availability of funds to industries
and traders.</li>
        <li>A step forward towards globalisation by
way of connecting domestic financial market with world financial market.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Apprehensions regarding capital account convertibility:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Flight of capital.</li>
        <li>Dominance of foreign financial institutions
over domestic players.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Suggestions for moving over to capital account
convertibility:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>First strengthen your own/domestic market for Capital and 
improve financial fundamentals such as fiscal deficit and inflation.</li>
        <li>Boost exports and then slowly open up.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility</i></strong></div>

Tarapore Committee on Capital Account Convertibility suggested that notwithstanding advantages of Capital Account Convertibility, India
should achieve certain preconditions and signpost before making any haste towards full convertibility. As long as the economy is not robust
with regard to its fiscal management and external balance of payments, any measure to hasten
full convertibility on the C/A would prove disastrous.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN EXCHANGE MANAGEMENT
ACT (FEMA), 1999</i></strong></div>

The Foreign Exchange Management Act
(FEMA) has replaced the Foreign Exchange
Regulation Act (FERA). Main reason for making FEMA that relaxes control on foreign exchange is that India has made its currency, i.e.
Rupee, convertible on current account. This is
to facilitate the external trade and payments
and promote the orderly development and maintenance of the foreign exchange market in
India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PRECONDITIONS AND SIGNPOSTS
FISCAL CONSOLIDATIONS</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduction in Gross Fiscal Deficit as percentage of Gross Domestic Product from
budgeted 4.5 in 1997-98 to 4.0 in 1998-99
and further to 3.5 in 1999-2000.</li>
        <li>Introduction of Consolidated Sinking Fund.</li>
        <li>Introduction of a system of fiscal transparency and accountability on the lines
New Zealand Fiscal Responsibility Act.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MANDATED INFLATION RATE</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The mandated rate of inflation for the 3
year should be an average of 3% to 5%.</li>
        <li>RBI should be given freedom to attain the
tarred mandate of inflation approved by
the Parliament.</li>
        <li>There should be clear and transparent
guidelines on the circumstances under
which the mandate could be changed.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Some features of FEMA are as follows: -
<br>
<br>
Foreign trade transactions could be done only
with the persons authorized by R.B.I. No person can acquire, hold, own, possess or transfer
any foreign exchange, foreign security or immovable property outside India, except in cases
where the Act provides for this. Current account transactions are freely allowed. However,
in the public interest, the union government, in
consultation with the RBI, may impose reasonable restrictions on current account transactions.
Foreign exchange can be drawn for all current
account transactions, except those that are prohibited, while on the capital account forex
outflow is allowed only for transactions that
are permitted. The three schedules of FEMA
(current account transactions Rules, 2000)
specify the restrictions on current account transactions. The first schedule mentions the transactions that are prohibited, the second lists the
transactions that need the government's permission and the third schedule contains the
transactions that need the prior approval of
the RBI.
<br>
<br>
Prohibited Transactions: In the First Schedule money earned from lottery winnings, racing/riding or any other hobby is not allowed to
be remitted. The Second Schedule lists transactions that need government's approval such
as cultural tours and health insurance from a
company abroad, to mention just two. The
Third Schedule contains items, which require
RBI's permission. Thus, if a current account
transaction is not found in any of the abovementioned schedules, RBI permission is not
required. Even on capital account transactions,
the Central Bank has come out with twentyfive notifications, some of which cover these
transactions as well as areas such as exports
and insurance.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MONEY LAUNDERING ACT</i></strong></div>

    </ul>
</ol>

The Act, in line with India's commitment to
fight all forms of economic crimes, came into
being in 2002 but could not be brought into
force due to certain lacunae. It was accordingly in the Parliament's session to remove the
shortcomings that it came into effect on 1 July,
2005. As per the Act, every banking company,
financial institution and intermediary needs to
maintain a record of all transactions, the nature and value of which is being prescribed in
the rules. The Money Laundering (Amendment)
Regulations, 2012, have come into force on 1st
October 2012.
<br>
<br>
The Government has entrusted the work relating to investigation, attachment of property/proceeds of crime relating to the scheduled offences
under the Act and filing of complaints, etc. to the
Directorate of Enforcement in the Finance Ministry. India is committed to fight all forms of economic crimes, including money laundering.
The government of India has enacted a number of special laws regulating customs, excise,
taxes, foreign exchange, narcotic drugs, banking, insurance, trade and commerce to deal
with economic crimes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SEZ BILL</i></strong></div>

The Lok Sabha passed the Special Economic
Zones Bill, 2005 after adopting an official
amendment to drop the Bill's provision in granting flexibility in labour laws by the States in the
proposed Central Act. The original Act had no
direct Central role in laying down labour policy
in the SEZs. The Central legislation proposed
that the States may take suitable steps to grant
exemption from labour laws (clause 18) applicable in the special economic zones. Hence, the
Government moved an amendment to the SEZ
Act, 2005 by dropping this clause.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIRECT TAX CHANGES</i></strong></div>

7 pc additional customs duty would be applicable on Laptops as in case of computers.
4 pc countervailing duty removed on components used in the manufacture of mobile
handsets.
<br>
<br>
Duty on molasses cut from Rs 1,000 per tonne
to Rs 750 per tonne.
Excise duty anomaly on nylon tyre cord fabric removed.
<br>
<b>Objectives of the Act</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Making available goods and services free
of taxes and duties, bolstered by integrated
infrastructure for export production.</li>
        <li>A package of incentives to attract foreign
and domestic investments for promoting
export-led growth.</li>
        <li>The Bill is silent on conferring powers to
the Development Commissioners for allowing flexible labour policies in SEZ units.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Features of the Act</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To attract investment, both domestic and
foreign.</li>
        <li>To ensure employment generation since export activities hold the potential for job
creation.</li>
        <li>Provides for a stable and long-term fiscal
policy framework with minimum regulatory intervention for such zones.</li>
        <li>It also provides for a single-window clearance mechanism for the establishment of
SEZs.</li>
        <li>The Act provides that SEZs could also take
the form of port, airport, inland container
depot, land station and land customs stations, as the case may be, under Section 7
of the Customs Act.</li>
        <li>It empowers the Union Government to
specify an officer or agency for carrying
out surveys or inspections to verify or
ensure compliance with the provisions of
the Central Act by a developer or an entrepreneur.</li>
        <li>Under this dispensation, units would be eligible for 100 per cent tax exemption for 5
years, 50 per cent for the next five years and
50 per cent of the ploughed back export
profits for the next five years (in all 15 years).</li>
        <li>The Bill also proposes to grant exemption

SEZ on the lines of Section 54G of the
Income-Tax Act.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Special Economic Zones (SEZs)</i></strong></div>

A new scheme was introduced in Exim
Policy from 1.4.2000 for establishment of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) in different parts
of the country, with a view to providing an
internationally competitive and hassle free environment for export production.
The units operating in those zones are to be
deemed as outside the country's customs territory and will have full flexibility of operations.
They would be able to import capital goods
and raw materials duty free and would also be
able to access the same from Domestic Tariff
Area (DTA) without payment of excise duty.
Further no permission would be necessary
for inter-unit Sales or transfer of goods. There
would be no wastage norms or input output
norms. They would be able to undertake job
work for the DTA units and would also be able
to get their goods processed in the DTA.
The only condition would be that the units
in the zones would have to be a net foreign
exchange earner. DTA sales would be on payment of full customs duties and in accordance
with the import policy in force. The movement
of goods between SEZs and ports will be unrestricted and without any hindrance.
The SEZs imply a qualitative transformation
of the traditional Export Processing Zones
(EPZs). The improvements include 100 per cent
FDI investment through automatic route to
manufacturing SEZ units (barring a handful of
sensitive industries), no routine examination by
customs of export and import cargo in SEZs,
all imports on self-certification basis, duty free
material to be utilized over five years, no predetermined value addition, DTA sales on full
duty payment and various procedural simplification for operations like record keeping, interunit transfers, subcontracting, disposal of obsolete materials, etc.
SEZs will be permitted to set up in the public, private, joint sector or by the State Governments with a minimum size of not less than
100 hectares. These units may be for manufacturing, trading or service activity. Package of
incentives announced so far include exemption
from industrial licensing for manufacture of
items reserved for SSIs and removal of sectoral
ceilings on FDI in SEZ units.
<br>
<br>
From November 1, 2000 Export Processing
Zones at Kandla, Santa Cruz (Mumbai), Kochi
and Surat have been converted into SEZs. Approval has also been given for setting up SEZs
at Nawguneri (Tamilnadu), Positra (Gujarat),
Kulpi (West Bengal), Paradeep (Orissa), Bhadohi
and Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh), Kakinada
(Andhra Pradesh), Dronagiri (Maharashtra)
and Indore (Madhya Pradesh).
The performance of SEZs largely depends
on comprehensive liberalisation and freedom,
as inherent in the Chinese SEZ model. However, Chinese zones are many times larger than
those currently planned in India. The extent of
success of SEZs in India would, therefore crucially depend 
upon the degree to which domestic regulations; 
restrictions and infrastructure inadequacies are eliminated in those zones.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Export Processing Zones, Special Economic
Zones & Export Houses</i></strong></div>

FTZs/EPZs are industrial estates, which form
enclaves within the national customs territory
and are usually situated near international port
and/or airport. The entire production of such
Zones is normally exported. Imports of raw
materials, intermediate products, equipment &
machinery required for export production are
not subject to the payment of customs duty. A
characteristic feature of EPZs is the speed and
simplicity of import and export transactions.
Time-consuming customs procedures on import
into the Zones and exports from the zones are
kept to minimum.
<br>
<br>
Export Processing Zones in IndiaâSeven Export Processing Zones operating in the
country are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Kandla Free Trade Zone (KFTZ), Kandla,
Gujarat.</li>
        <li>Santa Cruz Electronics Export Processing
Zone (SEEPZ), Santa Cruz, Mumbai.</li>
        <li>Noida Export Processing Zones, Noida,
UP.</li>
        <li>Madras Export Processing Zones, Chennai.</li>
        <li>Cochin Export Processing Zones, Cochin, Kerala.</li>
        <li>Falta Export Processing Zones, Falta, West
Bengal.</li>
