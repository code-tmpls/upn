<h3>Poverty And Un-Employment</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS POVERTY?</i></strong></div>

Poverty refers to the inability to get the minimum consumption requirement for life, health
and efficiency. Poverty is painful and it leads
to discontentment. If people are left to live
amidst poverty for a long time it may have
serious political repercussions. The people's discontentment may lead to social tension as seen
in Bihar, Andhra and M.P. (Naxalite movements).
<br>
<br>
The word 'Poverty' is used in two senses:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Absolute Poverty: This approach defines
minimum level of income required to sustain life: for example, estimating minimum
dietary needs and how these can be most
cheaply met. In the official estimates of
poverty by the Planning Commission in
India, the concept of 'absolute poverty' has
been adopted. The concept of absolute poverty in India is based on 'nutritional criteria' expressed in terms of 'consumption expenditure'. There is one 'consumption expenditure level' above which the people are
well-off and below which people are poor.
This consumption expenditure level is
known as 'poverty line'.</li>
        <li>Relative Poverty: This approach defines
poverty relative to appropriate comparator
groups. Thus while an individual may have
more than enough income to sustain life, if
it is very low compared to the rest of the
community, the individual would be
viewed as being in poverty. As society
grows richer so the income level defining
poverty rises. On this basis we have various economic categories in society 
<br>
(1) Higher Income Groups 
<br>
(2) Middle Income Groups 
<br>
(3) Lower Income Groups.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Poverty Estimates 2004-05</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Planning Commission as the Nodal
agency in the Government of India for estimation of poverty has been estimating the
number and percentage of poor at national
and state levels. Since, March 1997 it has
been using the Expert Group Method (Expert Group on Estimation of Proportion and
Number of Poor) to estimate poverty. According to this method the estimates of
poverty are made from the large sample
survey data on household consumer expenditure conducted by the National Sample
Survey Organization (NSSO) of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. 
Using this methodology the
Planning Commission, in the past, has released poverty estimates for the year 1973-
74, 1977-78, 1983, 1987-88 and 1993-94
by the Government of India on 11th March
1997. Subsequently, the poverty estimates
for 1999-2000 were released by the Government of India on 22nd February 2001.
While releasing the estimates of poverty
for 1999-2000, it had been noted that these
estimates were not strictly comparable with
the estimates for the previous years.</li>
        <li>The state-wise rural and urban poverty
lines for the year 2004-05 are given in
Table-1. These are estimated using the
original state-specific poverty lines identified by the Expert Group and updating
them to 2004-05 prices using the Consumer
Price Index of Agricultural Labourers
(CPIAL) for rural poverty lines and Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers
(CPIIW) for urban poverty lines.</li>
        <li>The NSSO released the result of the latest
large sample survey data on household
consumer expenditure (NSS 61st Round),
covering the period July 2004 to June 2005
[Report No.508 (61/1.0/1)]. From this
data, two different consumption distributions for the year 2004-05 have been obtained. The first one from the consumption data collected using 30-day recall period (also known as reference period) for
all the items. The other distribution is obtained from the consumer expenditure data
collected using 365-day recall period for
five infrequently purchased non-food
items, namely, clothing, footwear, durable
goods, education and institutional medical expenses and 30-day recall period for
the remaining items. These two consumption distributions have been termed as
Uniform Recall Period (URP) consumption
distribution and Mixed Recall Period
(MRP) consumption distribution respectively. The Planning Commission, using the
Expert Group methodology has estimated
poverty in 2004-05 using both the distributions.</li>
        <li>The state specific percentage and number
of poor in rural and urban areas estimated
from URP consumption distribution gives
the state specific percentage and number
of poor in rural and urban areas estimated
from MRP consumption distribution.</li>
        <li>The percentage and number of poor in
2004-05 estimated from URP consumption
distribution of NSS 61st Round of consumer expenditure data are comparable
with the poverty estimates of 1993-94. The
percentage and number of poor in 2004-
05 estimated from MRP consumption distribution of NSS 61st Round of consumer
expenditure data are roughly (but not
strictly) comparable with the poverty estimates of 1999-2000.</li>
        <li>The URP-consumption distribution data of
the 61st Round yields a poverty ratio of
28.3 per cent in the rural areas, 25.7 per
cent in the urban areas and 27.5 per cent
for the country as a whole in 2004-05. The
corresponding figures obtained from the
MRP-consumption distribution data of the
61st Round are 21.8 percent in the rural
areas, 21.7 per cent in the urban areas
and 21.8 per cent for the country as a
whole.</li>
        <li>The poverty estimates in 2004-05 based on
URP consumption distribution (27.5 percent) is comparable with the poverty estimates of 1993-94, which was 36 per cent.
The poverty estimates in 2004-05 based on
MRP consumption (21.8 per cent) is
roughly (but not strictly) comparable with
the poverty estimates of 1999-2000, which
was 26.1 per cent.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Expert Committee/Lakadawala Committee's
Recommendations</i></strong></div>

In view of the criticism of the official method
of estimation of poverty, the Planning Commission Constituted an Expert Group in 1992 under the chairmanship of Prof. Lakadawala to
examine the methodology and computational
aspects of poverty ratio. Following are the main
features of the expert committee's recommendation -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The expert group retained the concept of
poverty line as defined by the earlier official method.</li>
        <li>It suggested changes in the price deflator
to update the poverty line for use in later
years.</li>
        <li>It suggested the use of state-specific price
indices so that the changes in the cost of
consumption basket of the people below
the poverty line may be reflected realistically.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

It recommended the use of NSS data on consumption expenditure without adjusting it to
the National Accounts estimates of consumption expenditure for estimation of ratio of people
below poverty line.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TYPES OF UNEMPLOYMENT</i></strong></div>

Frictional Unemployment: This kind of unemployment arises because of the continuous movement of people between regions, jobs or shifting through different stages of the life cycle.
Even if an economy were at full employment
there would remain some unemployment as
there exists a time gap in coincidence of those
looking for a job and those who are ready to
employ. This kind of unemployment may also
be called as voluntary unemployment as workers are willingly selecting between Jobs and regions.
Structural Unemployment: This kind of unemployment arises because of a mismatch between
the supply of and demand for workers
(depending on level of investment and capital
formation). Mismatches may occur because the
demand for one kind of labor is rising while
the demand for another kind is falling and
supplies do not adjust quickly. This may happens as certain sectors grow while others decline.
<br>
<br>
Cyclical Unemployment: This kind of unemployment exists when the overall demands for
labor is low. As total spending and output fall,
unemployment rises everywhere. The simultaneous increase in unemployment in many markets trends to cyclical unemployment. This kind
of unemployment occurs during recessions
when employment falls as a result of an imbalance between aggregate supply and demand.
Our study of simple demand and supply curves
in microeconomics suggest that true exists a
market clearing price at which demand and
supply equals. The commodities market in perfect competition gets cleared at this equilibrium
price. Since unemployment servants all the time
it seems that there is something which prevents
labor markets from getting cleared away. This
means to say that there exists inflexibility in
wage rates, which prevents them to adjust
downward and hence unemployment prevents.
<br>
<br>
In this context, we now study the terms Voluntary & Involuntary unemployment.
Voluntary unemployment: This refers to those
workers who are not willing to work at the
going wage rate even if they could get one.
This suggests that voluntarily unemployed
workers might prefer leisure to jobs at the
going wage rate. The existence of voluntary
unemployment suggest that an economy may
be performing at the peak of efficiency even
though it generates a certain amount of unemployment.
Involuntary unemployment: It refers to those
workers currently unemployed even though
they are ready to join at the market wage rate.
The resultant over supply of labor at the enjoying wage rate does not lead to downward movements in wage rates because of the inflexibility
of wage rates to move downward. This happens due to imperfections in the labor market
in the form of labor unions (which prevents
downward movements of wage rates) or minimum-wage rate stipulation by the government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Unemployment in India</i></strong></div>

India is predominantly an agrarian economy.
The industrial sector in India has not grown
sufficiently to absorb the labour force (15-60
age group), which is increasing with an increase
in population. In an agrarian society where assured 
source of irrigation is available only to
One-third of the cultivated area, agriculture
turns out to be only a seasonal activity. Therefore our 
farmers and labourers are faced with
seasonal unemployment. Another remarkable
feature about agriculture is the existence of
disguised unemployment in this sector. Since
India is a country where about 65 per cent of
the masses depend on agriculture for livelihood,
the land-man ratio is very adverse. This implies
that there is a huge burden on land. Disguised
unemployment refers to employment of a farmer
(or labourer) in agricultural activity even if his/
her marginal productivity is close to zero. For
example if a farm unit is producing 100 quintals with the 
help of 10 labourers and now if a
unit of labour is increased (total labourers
become 11 in number) but production still remains 
only 100 quintals, the marginal product
of one additional unit of labour is zero. This is
disguised unemployment, which is peculiar to
agriculture sector. Prof. Arthur Lewis had suggested 
the method for capital formation through
surplus of labour. In such a model disguisedly
unemployed labourers in the agriculture sector
were to be shifted to a more productive sector
while sticking to the same consumption level,
these labourers produce capital.
<br>
<br>
India is a country characterized by inequality of income and wealth as well as massive
poverty with around 36 per cent of the population (1993) living below the poverty line. Here
there are people who have no tangible resources
to fall back upon. They remain unemployed for
a large part of the year. This is known as openunemployment or chronic unemployment. Then
there are people who are partially employed in
terms of their still and qualification as well as
time in employment. Such cases are referred to
as under employment.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Labor Force and Unemployment</i></strong></div>

The official definition of "labour force" (Persons in the age group of 15-60) leaves out a
large number of people who would work if
they had some prospect of a job. The total
population of working age is far larger than
the officially defined labour force. In the year
2000, when employment was 337 million, and
the official figure of the labour force was 363
million, the working age population was 578
million. By March 2004, when employment
would be 349 million, the working age population would have risen to 662 million. In other
words, 313 million, or almost half the population in the working age group, are unable to
engage in any 'gainful activity' because of the
existing economic order and the policies it has
adopted.
<br>
<br>
The three concepts of unemployment developed by the NSSO
The three concepts of unemployment developed by the NSSO primarily refer to chronic
unemployment and underemployment. The
three concepts are as follows:-
(a) Usual Status unemployment - This concept is meant to determine the usual Activity Status - employed or unemployed or
outside the labour force - of those covered
by the survey (N.S.S.O). The activity status
is determined with reference to a longer
period; say a year proceeding to the time of
survey. The persons covered by the survey
may be classified into those working and/
or available for work in their principal activity sector, and those working and/or
available for work in subsidiary sector, that
is, a sector other than their principal activity sector. Hence, within the usual status
concept, the estimates are now derived on
the usual principle status as well as usual
principal and subsidiary status basis.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Current Weekly Status - This concept determines the activity status of a
person with reference to a period of preceding seven days. If in this period a person seeking employment fails to get work
for even one hour on any day, he (or she)
is deemed to be unemployed.</li>
        <li>The Current Daily Status - This concept
considers the activity status of a person for
each day of the proceeding seven days. A
person who works for one hour but less than
four hours is considered having worked for
half a day. If he works for four hours or
more during a day, he is considered as employed for the whole day. The current Daily
Status unemployment rate is a time rate. It is the most appropriate and 
comprehensive measure of unemployment.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Employment and Unemployment in India</i></strong></div>

Agricultural and allied sectors accounted for
about 60% of the total workforce in 2003 same
as in 1993-94. At present agriculture contributes 52 percent 
of total employment. While agriculture has faced stagnation in 
growth, services have seen a steady growth. Of the total
workforce, 8% is in the organised sector, 
twothirds of which are in the public sector. The
NSSO survey estimated that in 1999-2000, 106
million, nearly 10% of the population were unemployed and the overall unemployment rate
was 7.3%, with rural areas doing marginally
better (7.2%) than urban areas (7.7%). India's
labor force is growing by 2.5% annually, but
employment only at 2.3% a year.
<br>
<br>
Unemployment in India is characterized by
chronic underemployment or disguised unemployment. Government schemes that target
eradication of both poverty and unemployment
(which in recent decades has sent millions of
poor and unskilled people into urban areas in
search of livelihoods) attempt to solve the problem, 
by providing financial assistance for setting
up businesses, skill honing, setting up public
sector enterprises, reservations in governments,
etc. The decreased role of the public sector after
liberalization has further underlined the need
for focusing on better education and has also
put political pressure on further reforms.
Child labor is a complex problem that is basically 
rooted in poverty. The Indian government is implementing the world's largest child
labor elimination program, with primary education 
targeted for 250 million. Numerous nongovernmental and voluntary organizations are
also involved. Special investigation cells have
been set up in states to enforce existing laws
banning employment of children (under 14) in
hazardous industries. The allocation of the Government of India for the eradication of child labor
was $10 million in 1995-96 and $16 million in
1996-97. The allocation for 2007 is $21 million.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Employment</i></strong></div>

The estimates of employment and unemployEmployment and Unemployment in Million Persons Years (by CDS basis)
on Usual Principal Status (UPS) basis from
various rounds of NSSO survey are available.
In the meantime, the Eleventh Five year Plan
has largely used the Current Daily Status (CDS)
basis of estimation of employment and unemployment in the country. It has also been observed that the estimates based on daily status
are the most inclusive rate of 'unemployment'
giving the average level of unemployment on a
day during the survey year. It captures the unemployed days of the chronically unemployed,
the unemployed days of usually employed who
become intermittently unemployed during the
reference week and unemployed days of those
classified as employed according to the criterion
of current weekly status. The estimates presented
earlier also need revisiting so as to be based on
population projections released by National Commission on Population.
Estimates on employment and unemployment on CDS basis indicate that employment
growth during 1999-2000 to 2004-05 has accelerated significantly as compared to the growth
witnessed during 1993-94 to 1999-2000. During 1999-2000 to 2004-05, about 47 million work
opportunities were created compared to only
24 million in the period between 1993-94 and
1999-00. Employment growth accelerated from
1.25 per cent per annum to 2.62 per cent per
annum. However, since the labour force grew
at a faster rate of 2.84 per cent than the
workforce, unemployment rate also rose. The
incidence of unemployment on CDS basis increased from 7.31 per cent in 1999-00 to 8.28
percent in 2004-05.
<br>
<br>
The decline in overall growth of employment
during 1993-94 to 1999-00 was largely due to
the lower absorption in agriculture. The share
of agriculture in total employment dropped
from 61 per cent to 57 per cent. This trend
continued and the share of agriculture in total
2004-05. While the manufacturing sector's share
increased marginally during this period, trade,
hotel and restaurant sector contributed significantly in earlier years. The other important
sectors whose shares in employment have increased are transport, storage and communications apart from financial, insurance, real estate, business and community, social and personal services.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LATEST IN POVERTY AND
UNEMPLOYMENT</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Poverty</i></strong></div>

The Planning Commission, the nodal agency
for estimating the number and proportion of
people living below the poverty line at national
and state levels, separately for rural and urban
areas, makes poverty estimates based on a large
sample survey of household consumption expenditure 
carried out by the National Sample Survey
Office (NSSO) approximately every five years. The
methodology for estimation of poverty has been
reviewed from time to time. The Planning Commission 
constituted an Expert Group under the
Chairmanship of Professor Suresh D. Tendulkar
in December 2005, which submitted its report in
December 2009. The recomputed poverty estimates for the 
years 1993-94 and 2004-05 as recommended by the Tendulkar Committee have
been accepted by the Planning Commission. As
per the Tendulkar Committee Report, the national
poverty line at 2004-05 prices was a monthly per
capita consumption expenditure of Rs. 446.68 in
rural and ` 578.80 in urban areas in 2004-05. The
above poverty lines which refer to the national
average, vary from state to state because of price
differentials.
<br>
<br>
The Tendulkar Committee has mentioned in
its report that the proposed poverty lines have
been validated by checking the adequacy of
actual private expenditure per capita near the
poverty lines on food, education, and health by
comparing them with normative expenditures
consistent with nutritional, educational, and
health outcomes. In order to have a two-point
comparison of changes in head count ratio, the
Expert Group has re-estimated poverty for 1993-
94. The head-count ratios for 1993-94 and 2004-
05 as released earlier by the Planning Commission. Even though the Tendulkar methodology
gives higher estimates of headcount ratios for
both 1993-94 and 2004-05, the extent of poverty
reduction is 8.1 percentage points which is not
very different from the reduction of 8.5 percentage points during the same period as per
Lakdawala Methodology.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Inequality</i></strong></div>

According to HDR 2011, inequality in India
for the period 2000-11 in terms of the income
Gini coefficient was 36.8. India's Gini index was
more favourable than those of comparable countries like South Africa (57.8), Brazil (53.9), Thailand (53.6), Turkey (39.7), China (41.5), Sri Lanka
(40.3), Malaysia (46.2), Vietnam (37.6), and even
the USA (40.8), Hong Kong (43.4), Argentina
(45.8), Israel (39.2), and Bulgaria (45.3).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Employment</i></strong></div>

The Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) aimed
at generation of 58 million work opportunities.
The NSSO quinquennial survey has reported
an increase in work opportunities to the tune
of 18 million under the current daily status
(CDS) between 2004-05 and 2009-10. However,
the overall labour force expanded by only 11.7
million. This was considerably lower than in
comparable periods earlier, and can be attributed to the much larger retention of youth in
education and also because of lower labour force
participation among working-age women As a
result, unemployment in absolute terms came
down by 6.3 million. The lower growth in the
labour force is not expected to continue as educated youth are expected to join the labour force
in increasing numbers during the Twelfth Plan
and in the years beyond. This means that the
pace of job/ livelihood creation must be greatly
accelerated. The Twelfth Plan Approach Paper
therefore lays greater stress on skill building which
can be viewed as an instrument for improving
the effectiveness and contribution of labour to
overall production. This will push the production
possibility frontier outward and take the economy
on to a higher growth trajectory and can also be
viewed as a means of empowerment.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Employment in the Organised sector</i></strong></div>

Employment growth in the organized sector, public and private combined, has increased
by 1.9 per cent in 2010, which is lower than the
annual growth for the previous year. The annual
growth rate for the private sector was much higher
than that for the public sector. However, in respect of both sectors, annual increase in employment had slowed down in 2010 vis-à-vis 2009.
The share of women in organized-sector employment was 20.4 per cent in 2010 March end and
has remained nearly constant in recent years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Unemployment</i></strong></div>

A comparison between different estimates of
unemployment in 2009-10 indicates that the
CDS estimate of unemployment is the highest.
The higher unemployment rates according to the
CDS approach compared to the weekly status
and usual status approaches indicate a high
degree of intermittent unemployment. Interestingly urban v unemployment was higher under
both the UPSS and CWS but rural
unemployment was higher under the CDS
approach. This possibly indicates higher intermittent or seasonal unemployment in rural than
urban areas, something that employment generation schemes like the MGNREGA need to pay
attention to. However, overall unemployment
rates were lower in 2009-10 under each approach
vis-a-vis 2004-05. Labour force participation rates
(LFPR) under all three approaches declined in
2009-10 compared to 2004-05. However, the decline in female LFPRs was larger under each
measure in comparison with male LFPRs which
either declined marginally (UPSS), remained constant (CWS), or increased marginally (CDS).

This flagship programme of the Government
of India aims at enhancing livelihood security
of households in rural areas of the country by
providing at least one hundred days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to
every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. It also mandates 1/3 participation for women. The primary objective of the scheme is to augment
wage employment. This is to be done while
also focusing on strengthening natural resource
management through works that address causes
of chronic poverty like drought, deforestation,
and soil erosion and thus encourage sustainable development. The MGNREGA was notified in 200 districts in the first phase with effect from 2 February 2006 and then extended
to additional 130 districts in the financial year
2007-08. The remaining districts with rural areas were brought under the Act with effect
from 1 April 2008. Out of total outlay of ` 40,000
crore approved for 2011-12, Rs. 21,471.92 crore
has been released to the states/union territories
and the total funds available with states including the opening balance of Rs. 18,185.23
crores (on 1 April 2011) are Rs. 41,615.05 crore.
Of these Rs. 21,124.74 crore has been utilized
as reported on 19 January 2012. About 3.80
crore households have been provided employment under the programme. During the same
period, 122.37 crore persondays employment
has been generated across the country out of
which 60.45 crore were women (49.40 per cent),
27.27 crore (22.62 per cent) SCs, and 20.97 crore
(17.13 per cent) STs. At national level, the average wage paid under the MGNREGA has
increased from Rs. 65 in FY 2006-7 to Rs. 120
in FY 2011-12 (up to November 2011).</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Sector in India</i></strong></div>

Social sector comprises of education, health,
housing and all welfare programmes for the
poor, unemployed, women, children, minorities, farmers and certain programmes for rural
development. The development in social sector
in India lags behind because of paucity of funds,
lack of focus of the government, leakages
through corruption and absence of good governance.
<br>
<br>
Social Sector Spending Central government expenditure on social 
services and rural development (Plan and nonPlan) has consistently gone up over the years.
It has increased from 13.38 per cent in 2006-07
to 18.47 per cent in 2011-12. Central support
for social programmes has continued to expand
in various forms although most social-sector subjects fall within the purview of the states. Major
programme-specific funding is available to states
through centrally sponsored schemes. Expenditure on social services (which include education, sports, art and culture, medical and public health, family welfare, water supply and
sanitation, housing, urban development, welfare of SCs, STs and OBCs, labour and labour
welfare, social security, nutrition, and relief for
natural calamities,) by the general government
(centre and states combined) has also shown
increase in recent years reflecting the higher
priority given to this sector. Expenditure on
social services as a proportion of total expenditure increased from 21.6 per cent in 2006-07 to
24.1 per cent in 2009-10 and further to 25 per
cent in 2011-12 (BE). As a proportion of the
gross domestic product (GDP), its share increased from 5.57 per cent in 2006-07 to 6.76
per cent, 6.91 per cent, and 7.34 per cent in
2008-09, 2009-10, and 2010-11 respectively,
helping India face the global crisis without much
adverse impact on the social sector. In 2011-12
it is expected to be 6.74 per cent as per the BE.
<br>
<br>
While expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP has increased from 2.72 per cent
in 2006-7 to 3.11 per cent in 2011-12 (BE), that
on health has increased from 1.25 per cent in
2006-7 to 1.30 per cent in 2011-12 (BE). Of
total social services expenditure, that on 'Others' has fallen in 2011-12 (BE).

<br>
<br>
<b>The Unorganized Workers Social Security Act
2008:</b> The Act came into force from 16 May
2009 with the objective of providing social security to unorganized workers. The Unorganized Workers' Social Security Rules 2009 have
also been framed. Constitution of the National
Social Security Board in 2009 was another significant step. The Board recommended that
social security schemes, namely the RSBY providing health insurance, JBY providing death
and disability cover and Indira Gandhi National
Old Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS) providing old age pension be extended to building
and other construction workers, MGNREGA
workers, Asha workers, Anganwadi workers
and helpers, porters/coolies/gangmen, and
casual and daily wagers.
<br>
<b>National Social Security Fund:</b> A National Social Security Fund for Unorganized Sector

has been set up. This Fund will support schemes
for weavers, toddy tappers, rickshaw pullers,
bidi workers, etc.
<br>
<b>Bilateral Social Security Agreements:</b> Bilateral
social security agreements have been signed with
Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway to protect the interests of
expatriate workers and companies on a reciprocal basis. These agreements help workers by
providing exemption from social security contribution in case of posting, totalization of contribution period, and exportability of pension
in case of relocation to the home country or
any third country.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND
DEVELOPMENT</i></strong></div>

<b>Bharat Nirman:</b> This programme, launched in
2005-06 for building infrastructure and basic
amenities in rural areas, has six components,
namely rural housing, irrigation potential,
drinking water, rural roads, electrification, and
rural telephony. A goal has been set to provide
connectivity to all villages with a population of
1000 (500 in hilly or tribal areas) with allweather roads. New connectivity is proposed
to a total of 63,940 habitations under Bharat
Nirman. This will involve construction of 189,897
km of rural roads. In addition, Bharat Nirman
envisages upgradation /renewal of 194,130 km
of existing rural roads. Under the rural roads
component of Bharat Nirman, 42,249 habitations
have been provided allweather road connectivity up to December 2011 and projects for connecting 16,126 habitations are at different stages
of implementation. Under the PMGSY, over
19,443 km of all-weather roads have been completed, including upgradation during 2011-12
(up to December 2011). New connectivity has
been provided to 3710 habitations at an expenditure of Rs. 7514 crore.
<br>
<b>IAY :</b> The IAY is one of the six components of
the Bharat Nirman programme. During 2010-
11, as against the target of 29.09 lakh houses,
27.15 lakh houses were constructed. (Also see
state-wise performance in Table 13.10.) During
financial year 2011-12, against the physical
target of 27.26 lakh houses, 21.18 lakh houses
were sanctioned and 7.26 lakh constructed as
on 31October 2011. Since the inception of the
scheme, 271 lakh houses have been completed
till September 2011. The unit assistance provided to rural BPL households for construction
of a dwelling unit under the IAY has been revised with effect from 1 April 2010 from Rs
35,000 to Rs. 45,000 for plain areas and from
Rs. 38,500 to Rs. 48,500 for hilly/ difficult areas. In addition, construction of IAY houses
have been included in the differential rate of
interest (DRI) scheme for lending up to ` 20,000
per housing unit at an interest rate of 4 per
cent. Sixty left wing extremism (LWE) affected
districts have been made eligible for a higher
rate of unit assistance of Rs. 48,500. Under this
scheme a homestead site of 100-250 sq.m will
be provided to those rural BPL households who
have neither land nor a house site. For this
purpose, Rs. 10,000 per beneficiary, to be shared
by the centre and states in a 50 : 50 ratio, will
be provided to the District Rural Development
Agencies (DRDAs).
<br>
<b>Rural drinking water:</b> Drinking water supply
is one of the components of Bharat Nirman.
The present status of provision of safe drinking
water in rural areas as measured by habitations where the population is fully covered, as
per information reported by the states is that
about 72 per cent of rural habitations are fully
covered. The rest are either partially covered or
have chemically contaminated drinking water
sources. As against the target of 653,798 habitations during the Eleventh Five year Plan, the
coverage up to 31 March 2011 was 526,667
(80.56 per cent). The States of Jharkhand,
Chhattisgarh, Nagaland, Madhya Pradesh,
Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,
Kerala, and Uttarakhand have exceeded their
targets whereas Sikkim, Punjab, Assam,
Rajasthan, Arunachal Pradesh, and Jammu and
Kashmir have reported low (less than 50 per
cent) achievement against targets. Expenditure
for drinking water supply during the Bharat
Nirman period increased considerably from Rs.
4098 crore in 2005-06 to Rs. 8500 crore in 2011-12. 
All uncovered habitations have been reported covered as on 1April 2011. In order to
give effect to the policy initiatives mentioned in
the Eleventh Five Year Plan document, the
guidelines for the Rural Water Supply
Programme were revised in 2009 and renamed
the National Rural Drinking Water Programme
(NRDWP). The Jalmani programme, a scheme
to provide 100 per cent assistance to states for
installing stand-alone water purification systems
in schools in rural areas was launched in 2008-
09. In pursuance of the same, Rs. 200 crore
was released to states in 2008-09 and 2009-10
to cover 1 lakh schools. So far about 65,503
schools have been covered under this scheme.
<br>
<b>Rural Sanitation-Total Sanitation Campaign
(TSC):</b> The TSC is one of the flagship
programmes of the government. As of December 28, 2011, TSC projects have been sanctioned
in 607 rural districts of the country at a total
outlay of Rs. 22,022 crore, with a central share
of Rs. 14,425 crore. The approved central outlay for the TSC in the Eleventh Plan is Rs. 7816
crore. The annual budgetary support was
gradually increased from Rs. 202 crore in 2003-
4 to Rs. 1500 crore in 2011-12. The TSC follows
a community-led and people-centric approach,
laying emphasis on information, education, and
communication (IEC) for demand generation
for sanitation facilities. To motivate the community towards creating sustainable sanitation
facilities and their usage, the incentive for Individual household latrines for BPL households
has been increased from Rs. 2200 (Rs. 2700 for
hilly and difficult areas) to Rs. 3200 (Rs. 3700
for hilly and difficult areas) with effect from 1
June 2011. With the scaling up of the TSC,
combined with higher resource allocation,
programme implementation has improved substantially. As per Census 2001 data, only 21.9
per cent rural households had access to latrines.
Since 1999, over 8.30 crore toilets have been
provided for rural households under the TSC.
<br>
<br>
A significant achievement has also been the
construction of 11.64 lakh school toilet units
and 3.94 lakh Anganwadi toilets. This has led
to substantial increase in rural sanitation coverage from 21.9 per cent in 2001 to about 85.95
per cent as of January 2012 as per the progress
reported by states. With increasing budgetary
allocations and focus on rural areas, the number of households being provided with toilets
annually has increased from only 6.21 lakh in
2002-3 to 122 lakh in 2010-11. In the year 2011-
12 (up to January 2012), more than 63 lakh
toilets have been provided to rural households.
The active participation of women and adolescent girls in the sanitation programme has been
encouraged with special components for them.
The Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP) incentive
scheme has been launched to encourage PRIs
to take up sanitation promotion. The award is
given to those PRIs that attain a 100 per cent
open defecation-free environment. A total of
25,145 gram panchayats, 166 intermediate
panchayats, and 10 district panchayats have
received the award in the last six years. Sikkim
has become the first state to receive the award.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SKILL DEVELOPMENT</i></strong></div>

In addition to constituting a three-tier institutional structure on Coordinated Action on
Skill Development consisting of (i) the Prime
Minister's National Council on Skill
Development(NCSD), (ii) National Skill Development Coordination Board (NSDCB), and (iii)
National Skill Development Corporation
(NSDC), the NCSD appointed an adviser to
the Prime Minister in the NCSD in January 2011.
As on 31 October 2011, the NSDC has approved
34 training projects spread across 177 districts
in 20 sectors. The NSDC has also approved
eight sector skill councils (SSCs). A new strategic framework for skill development for early
school leavers and existing workers has been
developed since May 2007 in close consultation
with industry, state governments, and experts.
At present, 1386 modules for employable skills
covering 60 sectors have been developed, 36
assessing bodies empanelled for conducting assessment, 6753 vocational training providers
(VTPs) registered, and more than 12.19 lakh
persons trained / tested (since inception).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>UIDAI</i></strong></div>

Implementation of the Unique Identification
(UID) project has progressed and about 13 crore
Aadhaar numbers (UID numbers) have already
been generated. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) has scaled up enrolments and has also established infrastructure
capabilities to generate 10 lakh Aadhaar numbers every day. The UIDAI is on the verge of
commencing Phase III of the scheme, which
apart from enrolling residents and issuing
Aadhaar numbers extends to providing
updation services, a robust authentication process as a means of enhancing service delivery
of various social schemes, and facilitating
financial inclusion and development of
Aadhaar-enabled applications to leverage
Aadhaar.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EDUCATION</i></strong></div>

The Twelfth Plan Approach Paper focuses
on teacher training and evaluation and measures to enforce accountability. It also stresses
the need to build capacity in secondary schools
to absorb the passouts from expanded primary
enrolments. The GER in higher education must
be targeted to increase from nearly 18 per cent.
<br>
<b>Initiatives for primary education
(RTE):</b> Free education for all children between
the ages of 6 and 14 years has been made a
fundamental right under the RTE Act 2009.
While the RTE Act was notified on 27 August
2009 for general information, the notification
for enforcing the provisions of the Act with
effect from 1 April 2010 was issued on 16 February 2010. It mandates that every child has a
right to elementary education of satisfactory and
equitable quality in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards. The
reform processes initiated in 2010-11 continued
during the year 2011-12.
<br>
<b>Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan
(RMSA):</b> The RMSA was launched in March
2009 with the objective of enhancing access to
secondary education and improving its quality.
In addition to ensuring access, the quality interventions include ensuring all secondary
schools conform to prescribed norms, removing
gender, socio-economic and disability barriers,
providing universal access to secondary level
education by 2017, i.e. by the end of the Twelfth
Five Year Plan, and achieving universal retention by 2020. The central and state governments
bear 75 per cent and 25 per cent of the project
expenditure respectively during the Eleventh
Five Year Plan. The funding pattern is in the
ratio of 90:10 for the north-eastern states. The
RMSA Annual Plan 2011-12 proposals received
from all 35 states/UTs were considered by the
Project Approval Board (PAB) of the scheme
and major interventions such as opening of 4032
new schools, strengthening of 15,567 existing
schools, 832 residential quarters for teachers,
and 52,352 additional teachers have been
approved.
<br>
<b>Model Schools Scheme:</b> A scheme for setting
up 6000 model schools as benchmarks of excellence at block level with one school per block
was launched in November 2008 with a view
to providing quality education to talented rural
children. The scheme has two modes of implementation: (i) 3500 schools are to be set up in
as many Educationally Backward Blocks(EBBs)
through state/UT governments and (ii) the remaining 2500 schools are to be set up under
PPP mode in blocks that are not educationally
backward. At present, only the first component is being implemented. The implementation of the PPP component will start from
Twelfth Five Year Plan. Since the inception of
the scheme, approval has been granted for setting up 1942 model schools in 22 states. Financial sanctions have been accorded for setting
up 1538 schools in 20 States and Rs. 1697.95
crore has been released as central share to these
states. During 2010-11, (140 schools) had become functional in Punjab (21 schools),
Karnataka (74 schools), Chhattisgarh (15
schools), Tamil Nadu (18 schools), and Gujarat
(12 schools) and Rs. 9.55 crore as recurring
grants was released to these states. In 2011-12,
the number of functional schools has increased
to 438 in seven states.
<br>
<b>Inclusive Education for the Disabled
at Secondary Stage (IEDSS):</b> The IEDSS scheme
was launched in 2009-10 replacing the earlier
Integrated Education for Disabled Children
(IEDC) scheme. While inclusive education for
disabled children at elementary level is being
provided under the SSA, this scheme provides
100 per cent central assistance for inclusive
education of disabled children studying in
Classes IX-XII in mainstream government, local
body, and government-aided schools. The aim
of the scheme is to facilitate continuation of
education of children with special needs up to
higher secondary level.
<br>
<b>Vocational Education:</b> The revised centrally
sponsored Vocationalisation of Secondary Education scheme aims to address the weaknesses
of the earlier scheme to strengthen vocational
education in Classes XI-XII. The components
approved for implementation in the remaining
period of the Eleventh Plan, i.e. 2011-12, include (a) strengthening of 1000 existing vocational schools and establishment of 100 new
ones through state governments, (b) assistance
to 500 vocational schools under the PPP mode,
(c) in-service training of seven days for 2000
existing vocational teachers and induction training of 30 days for 1000 new ones, (d) development of 250 competency based modules for each
individual vocational course, (e) establishment
of a vocational education cell within the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), (f)
assistance to 150 reputed NGOs to run
shortduration innovative vocational education
programmes, and (g) pilot programme under
the National Vocational Education Qualifications Framework(NVEQF) in Class IX in
Haryana and West Bengal.
<br>
<b>Saakshar Bharat (SB)/Adult Education:</b> The National Literacy Mission, recast as Saakshar Bharat
(SB) launched by the Prime Minister on 8 September 2009, reflects the enhanced focus on female literacy. The literacy rate according to the
2001 census was 64.83 per cent, improving to
74.04 per cent in 2011. The literacy rate improved
sharply among females as compared to males.
While the literacy rate for males rose by 6.9 per
cent from 75.26 per cent to 82.14 per cent, it
increased by 11.8 per cent for females from 53.67
per cent to 65.46 per cent. The target of the Eleventh Five Year Plan is to achieve 80 per cent
literacy. With just one year to go for the Twelfth
Five Year Plan, 74 per cent literacy has been
achieved. Literacy levels remain uneven across
states, districts, social groups, and minorities. The
government has taken positive measures to reduce the disparities by focusing on backward areas
and target groups. By March 2010, the programme
had reached 167 districts in 19 states covering
over 81,000 gram panchayats.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Higher Education</i></strong></div>

Higher education is of vital importance for
the country, as it is a powerful tool for building
a knowledge-based twenty-first-century society.
The Indian higher education system is one of
the largest in the world. At the time of Independence, there were only 20 universities and
500 colleges with 0.1 million students; these
have increased to 611 universities and university-level institutions and 31,324 colleges as on
August 2011. To prepare for the challenges of
the twenty-first century, the government has
taken a number of initiatives during the Eleventh Plan period focusing on improvement of
access along with equity and excellence, adoption of state-specific strategies, enhancement of
the relevance of higher education through curriculum reforms, vocationalization, networking,
and use of information technology and distance
education along with reforms in governance in
higher education. A large-scale expansion in
university education has been initiated during
the Eleventh Five Year Plan by setting up new
educational institutions comprising 30 central
universities, 8 new Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), 8 new Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), 10 new National Institutes of Technology (NITs), 20 new Indian Institutes of information Technology (IIITs), 3 new Indian Institutes of Science education and Research (IISERs),
2 new Schools of Planning and Architecture
(SPAs), 374 model colleges, and 1000 polytechnics. Other important initiatives include
upgradation of state engineering institutions,
expansion of research fellowships and provision
of hostels for girls, reservation for SCs, STs and
OBCs, focus on backward, hilly and remote locations including the north-east, facilitating
greater participation of students belonging to
minorities, girls, and persons with disabilities,
scholarships, provision of education loans with
interest free subsidies, setting up of polytechnics
in unserved areas, and degree colleges in low
GER districts. The National Mission in Education through ICT, which aims at providing high
speed broadband connectivity to universities and
colleges and development of e-content in various disciplines, is under implementation. Open
and distance learning is encouraged for increasing access to and making quality education available at any time, any place.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HEALTH</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Health Policy</i></strong></div>

The National Health Policy of 2002 and the
priorities set in the successive Five Year Plans
provide the framework for the implementation
of policies and programmes for health care. The
National Health Policy seeks to provide prophylactic and curative health-care services and
aims at achieving an acceptable standard of
good health amongst the general population in
the country by increasing access to the decentralized public health system. Access to the decentralized public health system is sought to be
increased through establishment of new infrastructure in deficient areas and upgrading of
existing infrastructure. Success in eliminating
or controlling diseases such as small pox, leprosy, polio, and TB is indicative of the progress
made in some areas of health. Overall sex ratio
in the country has increased from 933 in 2001
to 940 as per census 2011 (prov.). In 2011-12,
the Plan outlay for health is Rs. 26760 crore.
<br>
<br>
This outlay constitutes among others Rs. 17,840
crore under the NRHM and Rs. 2356 crore for
schemes/projects in the north-eastern region
and Sikkim. A provision of Rs. 1616.57 crore
has been earmarked for the Pradhan Mantri
Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY) aimed at
strengthening the tertiary sector. The National
Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and
Stroke (NPCDCS) has been allocated Rs. 125
crore in 2011-12. During 2011- 12, Rs. 1700
crore has been earmarked for the National Aids
Control Programme with the objective of halting and reversing the HIV epidemic in the country by integrating programmes for prevention,
care, support, and treatment. The government
also seeks to develop and promote the Indian
system of medicines in an organized and scientific manner by involvement/ integration of
AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and
Homeopathy) systems in national health-care
delivery and has allocated Rs. 900 crore plan
outlay for it in 2011-12.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Health Programmes</i></strong></div>

The government has launched a large number of programmes and schemes to address
major concerns and bridge the gaps in existing
health infrastructure and provide accessible, affordable, equitable health care. These include
the NRHM, National Programme for Health
Care of the Elderly (NPHCE), National Mental
Health Programme, NPCDCS, Pradhan Mantri
Swasthya Suraksha Yojana (PMSSY),
upgradation/strengthening of state government
medical colleges, development of paramedical
services and the Programmes of AYUSH. The
details of major programmes are as follows:
NRHM: The NRHM launched in 2005 aims to
improve accessibility to quality health care for
the rural population, bridge gaps in health care,
facilitate decentralized planning in the health
sector and bring about inter-sectoral convergence. The NRHM provided an overarching
umbrella to the existing health and family welfare programmes including Reproductive and
Child Health (RCH-II) and various programmes
for control of diseases, including tuberculosis,
leprosy, vector-borne diseases and blindness. The
effort is to integrate all vertical programmes.
All the programmes have now been brought
under the District Health Society at district level
and State Health Society at state level. Under
the NRHM, over 1.4 lakh health human resources have been added to the health system
across the country (up to September 2011)
which include 11,712 doctors/specialists,
10,851 AYUSH doctors, 66,784 auxiliary nurse
midwives (ANMs), 32,860 staff nurses, and
14,434 paramedics including AYUSH paramedics. Accredited social health activists (ASHAs)
are engaged in each village / large habitation
in the ratio of one per 1000 population.
Reproductive and Child Health (RCH): The
RCH Programme was launched in 1997-8 as a
separate entity up to the year 2004-5 as a part
of the Family Welfare Programme and was
brought under the ambit of the NRHM during
the Eleventh Plan. It has components such as
pulse polio immunization and routine immunization for protection of children from life threatening conditions that are preventable such as
tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, polio, and measles.
Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY): The JSY was
launched with focus on demand promotion for
institutional deliveries in states and regions
where these are low. It integrates cash assistance with delivery and post-delivery care. It
targets lowering of MMR by ensuring that deliveries are conducted by skilled birth attendants. The JSY scheme has shown rapid growth
in the last three years, with 90.37 lakh beneficiaries in 2008-9 to 106.96 lakh beneficiaries in
2010-11. The issues of governance, transparency, and grievance redressal mechanisms are
now the thrust areas for the JSY.
<br>
<br>
<b>Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK):</b> The
JSSK is a new initiative launched on 1 June
2011 to give free entitlements to pregnant
women and sick new borns for cashless delivery, C-Section, drugs and consumables, diagnostics, diet during stay in the health institutions, provision of blood, exemption from user
charges, transport from home to health institutions, transport between facilities in case of
referral, and drop back from Institutions to
home. A sum of Rs. 1437 crore has been allocated to the states during 2011-12 under the
JSSK. In order to reach out to difficult, inaccessible, backward and underserved areas with
poor health indicators, 264 high focus districts
in 21 states have been identified based on concentration of SC/ST population and presence
of left wing extremism for focused attention.
<br>
<b>National Vector Borne Disease Control
Programme:</b> This Programme is being implemented for prevention and control of vectorborne diseases such as malaria, filariasis, kalaazar, Japanese encephalitis, dengue, and
chikungunya. The government has taken various steps for tackling of vector-borne diseases
including dengue and chikungunya by the
states. There are 250 filariaendemic districts in
20 states /UTs in the country. The National
Health Policy (2002) aims at elimination of lym-
phatic filariasis in country by 2015. Kala-azar is
endemic in four states, namely Bihar, West Bengal, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh. During 2011,
31,322 cases and 78 deaths have been reported.
<br>
<b>Revised National Tuberculosis Control
Programme (RNTCP) :</b> The RNTCP, a centrally
sponsored ongoing scheme, is an application in
India of the WHO-recommended directly observed treatment short course popularly known
as DOTS. Under the progra mme, quality diagnosis and treatment facilities including a supply of anti-TB drugs are provided free of cost to
all TB patients. More than 13,000 microscopy
centres have been established in the country.
During 2010-11, the programme has achieved
new sputem positive case detection rate of 71
per cent and treatment success rate of 87 per
cent.
<br>
<b>National Leprosy Eradication Programme
(NLEP):</b> The NLEP was started in 1983 with
the objective of eradication of the disease. In
2005, the dreaded disease after 22 years recorded a case load less than 1 per 10,000 population at national level. The recorded prevalence further came down to 0.69 per 10,000 in
March 2011.
<br>
<b>National Programme for Control of Blindness
(NPCB):</b> The NPCB, launched in the year 1976
as a 100 per cent centrally sponsored scheme
with the goal of reducing the prevalence of
blindness to 0.3 per cent by 2020, showed reduction in the prevalence rate of blindness from
1.1 per cent (2001-2) to 1 per cent (2006-7).
<br>
<b>National Programme for Health Care of the
Elderly (NPHCE):</b> The NPHCE aims to provide
separate and specialized comprehensive health
care to senior citizens at various levels of the
state healthcare delivery system including outreach services. Some of the strategies include
