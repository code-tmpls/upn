<h3>Mulitlateral Agencies</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</i></strong></div>

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is
an international organization that oversees the
global financial system by following the macroeconomic policies of its member countries, in
particular those with an impact on exchange
rates and the balance of payments. It is an organization formed to stabilize international exchange rates and facilitate development. It also
offers financial and technical assistance to its
members, making it an international lender of
last resort. Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., USA. The International Monetary
Fund was created in July of 1944, with a goal to
stabilize exchange rates and assist the reconstruction of the world's international payment system. Countries contributed to a pool which could
be borrowed from, on a temporary basis, by
countries with payment imbalances.
<br>
<br>
The IMF currently has a near-global membership of 188 countries. To become a member,
a country must apply and then be accepted by
a majority of the existing members. In April
2012, Republic of South Sudan joined the IMF,
becoming the institution's 188th member.
Upon joining, each member country of the IMF
is assigned a quota, based broadly on its relative size in the world economy. The IMF's
membership agreed in November 2010 on a
major overhaul of its quota system to reflect
the changing global economic realities, especially the increased weight of major emerging
markets in the global economy.
A member country's quota defines its financial
and organizational relationship with the IMF.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Members Quota in the IMF</i></strong></div>

A member's quota in the IMF determines the
amount of its subscription, its voting weight, its
access to IMF financing, and its allocation of
Special Drawing Rights (SDRs). A member state
cannot unilaterally increase its quota - increases
must be approved by the Executive Board and
are linked to formulas that include many variables such as the size of a country in the world
economy. For example, in 2001, China was
prevented from increasing its quota as high as
it wished, ensuring it remained at the level of
the smallest G7 economy (Canada). In September 2006, the IMF's member countries agreed to
the first round of ad hoc quota increases for
four countries, including China.
<br>
<br>
The percentage of quotas of the individual
member-countries decides not just their voting
rights but also determines their access to the
Fund resources. Besides, the size of a country's
quota is a decisive factor in its level of representation in the Fund, as for example, the post
of a Director or his alternate on the Executive
Board of the Fund.
<br>
<br>
Industrial countries also attach great importance to their ranking in the Fund membership,
which is strictly in accordance with their quota
size. At present the largest member of the IMF
is the US, with a quota of SDR 42,122.4 million
and the smallest is Palau (SDR 3.1 million).
The quota largely determines the voting
power. Each member has 250 basic votes plus
one additional vote for each SDR 100,000 of
quota. Accordingly, the US has 421,961 votes
(16.75 per cent of the total) and Palau 768 votes
(0.03 per cent).
<br>
<br>
The amount of financing a member could
obtain from the IMF (its access limit) is based
on its quota. Under Stand-By and Extended
Arrangements, a member can borrow up to 100
percent of its quota annually and 300 per cent
cumulatively.
<br>
<br>
However, access may be higher in exceptional circumstances. Further, a member's share
of general SDR allocations is established in proportion to its quota.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IMF Financial Facilities</i></strong></div>

The IMF makes its financial resources available to member countries through a variety of
financial facilities. Except for the ESAF members avail themselves of the IMF's financial resources by purchasing (drawing) other members' currencies or SDRs with an equivalent
amount of their own currency. The IMF levies
charges on these drawings and requires that
members repurchase (repay) their own currency
from the IMF over a specified time.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IMF Financial Policies</i></strong></div>

IMF financial policies govern the modalities
for the use of its financial resources under existing IMF facilities. These include:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Reserve Tranche Policies: A member has
a reserve tranche position in the IMF to
the extent that its quota exceeds the IMF's
holdings of its currency, excluding credits
extended to it by the IMF. Subject only to
balance of payments need, a member may
draw up to the full amount of its reserve
tranche position at any time. This drawing does not constitute a use of IMF credit,
as its reserve position is considered part of
the member's foreign reserves, and is not
subject to an obligation to repay.</li>
            <li>Credit Tranche Policies: Credits under
regular facilities are made available to members in tranches (segments) of 25 percent of
quota. For first credit tranche drawings,
members must demonstrate reasonable efforts to overcome their balance of payments
difficulties, and no phasing applies. Upper
credit tranche drawings (over 25 per cent)
are normally phased in relation to certain
conditions or "performance criteria."</li>
            <li>Policy on Emergency Assistance: The IMF
provides emergency assistance by allowing members to make drawings to meet
balance of payments needs arising from
sudden and unforeseeable natural disasters and in postconflict situations. Normally
this takes the form of an outright purchase
of up to 25 percent of quota provided that
the member is cooperating with the IMF.
It does not entail performance criteria or a
phasing of drawings.</li>
            <li>Debt and Debt-Service Reduction Policies: Part of a credit extended to a member by the IMF under regular facilities can
be set aside to finance operations involving debt principal and debt service reduction. The exact amount of the set-aside is
determined on a case-by-case basis; its
availability is generally tied to program performance.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Regular IMF Facilities</i></strong></div>
    
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Stand-by arrangements (SBA): It is
designed to provide short-term balance of
payments assistance for deficits of a temporary or cyclical nature, such arrangements
are typically for 12 to 18 months. Drawings
are phased on a quarterly basis, with their
release made conditional on meeting performance criteria and the completion of periodic program reviews. Repurchases are
made 3¼ to 5 years after each purchase.</li>
            <li>Extended Fund Facility (EFF): It is designed
to support medium-term programs that
generally run for three years, the EFF aims
at overcoming balance of payments difficulties stemming from macroeconomic and
structural problems. Performance criteria
are applied, similar to those in stand-by
arrangements, and repurchases are made
in 4½ to 10 years.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Concessional IMF Facility</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
(ESAF): It was established in 1987, and
enlarged and extended in 1994. Designed
for low-income member countries with protracted balance of payments problems,
ESAF drawings are loans and not purchases of other members' currencies. They
are made in support of three-year programs
and carry an annual interest rate of 0.5
percent, with a 5½-year grace period and
a 10-year maturity. Quarterly benchmarks
and semiannual performance criteria apply; 80 low-income countries are currently
eligible to use the ESAF.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Special IMF Facilities</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Systemic Transformation Facility (STF):
It is in effect from April 1993 to April 1995.
The STF was designed to extend financial
assistance to transition economies experiencing severe disruption in their trade and
payments arrangements. Repurchases are
made over 4½ to 10 years.</li>
        <li>Compensatory and Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF): It provides compensatory financing for members experiencing temporary export shortfalls or excesses
in cereal import costs, as well as financial
assistance for external contingencies in
Fund arrangements. Repurchases are made
over 3¼ to 5 years.</li>
        <li>Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF): It
provides financial assistance for exceptional
balance of payments difficulties due to a
large short-term financing need resulting
from a sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence. Repurchases are expected
to be made within 1 to 1½ years, but can
be extended, with IMF Board approval, to
2 to 2½ years.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Special Drawing Rights</i></strong></div>

SDRs were originally created to replace Gold
and Silver in large international transactions.
Being that under a strict (international) gold
standard, the quantity of gold worldwide is
relatively fixed, and the economies of all participating IMF members as an aggregate are
growing, a perceived need arose to increase the
supply of the basic unit or standard proportionately. Thus SDRs, or "paper gold", are credits that nations with balance of trade surpluses
can 'draw' upon nations with balance of trade
deficits. So-called "paper gold" is little more
than an accounting transaction within a ledger
of accounts, which eliminates the logistical and
security problems of shipping gold back and
forth across borders to settle national accounts.
It has also been suggested that having holders
of US dollars convert those dollars into SDRs
would allow diversification away from the
dollar without accelerating the decline of the
value of the dollar. SDRs are defined in terms
of a basket of major currencies used in international trade and finance. At present, the currencies in the basket are, by weight, the United
States dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, and
the pound sterling. Before the introduction of
the euro in 1999, the Deutsche Mark and the
French Franc were included in the basket. The
amounts of each currency making up one SDR
are chosen in accordance with the relative
importance of the currency in international
trade and finance. The determination of the
currencies in the SDR basket and their amounts
is made by the IMF Executive Board every five
years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE WORLD BANK</i></strong></div>

The World Bank is one of two major financial institutions created as a result of the Bretton
Woods Conference in 1944. The United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference, commonly known as Bretton Woods conference,
was a gathering of 730 delegates from all 44
Allied nations at the Mount Washington Hotel,
situated in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire to
regulate the international monetary and financial order after the conclusion of World War II.
The conference was held from 1 July to 22 July
1944 when the agreements were signed to set
up the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (IBRD), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The World Bank Group (WBG) is a family of
five international organizations makes leveraged
loans, generally to poor countries. The Bank

came into formal existence on 27 December 1945
following international ratification of the Bretton
Woods agreements, which emerged from the
United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference (1 July - 22 July 1944). It also provided
the foundation of the Osiander-Committee in
1951, responsible for the preparation and evaluation of the World Development Report. Commencing operations on 25 June 1946, it approved its first loan on 9 May 1947 ($250M to
France for postwar reconstruction, in real terms
the largest loan issued by the Bank to date). Its
five agencies are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD)</li>
        <li>International Development Association
(IDA)</li>
        <li>International Finance Corporation (IFC)</li>
        <li>Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA)</li>
        <li>International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The term "World Bank" generally refers to the
IBRD and IDA, whereas the World Bank Group
is used to refer to the institutions collectively.
The World Bank differs from the World Bank
Group, in that the World Bank comprises only
two institutions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD)</li>
        <li>International Development Association
(IDA)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Whereas the latter incorporates these two in
addition to three more:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>International Finance Corporation (IFC)</li>
        <li>Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA)</li>
        <li>International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The World Bank is not a "bank" in the common sense. It is one of the United Nations' specialized agencies, and is made up of 188 member countries. These countries are jointly responsible for how the institution is financed and
how its money is spent. Along with the rest of
the developing community, the World Bank centers its efforts on reaching the Millennium Development Goals, agreed to by UN members in
2000 and aimed at sustainable poverty reduction. The "World Bank" is the name that has
come to be used for the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and
the International Development Association
(IDA). Together these organizations provide
low-interest loans, interest-free credit, and
grants to developing countries. Some 10,000
development professionals from nearly every
country in the world work in the World Bank's
Washington DC headquarters or in its 109 country offices. Interest-free credit and grant financing comes from IDA, the world's largest source
of concessional assistance. Some 40 rich countries provide the money for this funding by
making contributions every four years. IDA
credits make up about one-quarter of the Bank's
financial assistance. Aside from IDA funds, very
little of the Bank's income is provided by its
member countries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Current President of World Bank</i></strong></div>

An indirect presidential election was held on
16 April 2012 to choose a new president of the
World Bank to replace Robert Zoellick, whose
term expired in June. Although the organization has always had presidents from, and nominated by, the United States, this election featured the nomination of two non-United States
candidates for the first time, originating, respectively, from Nigeria and Colombia. Though the
Colombian Jose Antonio Ocampo withdrew his
candidacy in the final stages, the Nigerian Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-lweala remained
in the race. Eventually, and amid controversy,
the U.S. nominee Jim Young Kim was announced as the new president on 16 April.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WTO AND INDIAN ECONOMY</i></strong></div>

The world trade organization (WTO) is an
international trade institution. the wto
superseded and replaced the gatt. the gatt was
a provisional, multilateral agreement governing
international trade from 1947 until january 1,
1995. the creation of the wto was negotiated in
the final gatt round, the uruguay round. the
wto inherited a number of core principles from
the gatt. these principles include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Non–discrimination, which in practice
means two things. The first principle is
MFN–most favoured nation treatment. Any
trade concession a nation offers to one
member, it must offer to all. The second
principle is national treatment. This means
that imported products must be treated the
same as domestic goods.</li>
        <li>Reciprocity of Trade Concessions.</li>
        <li>Trade Liberalization.</li>
        <li>Transparency and predictability in import
and export rules and regulations.</li>
        <li>Favourable treatment to less developed
countries.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Although built on the GATT legacy, the
Uruguay Round and WTO added many new
issues and features. To begin with, many older
agreements were replaced by new, stronger
agreements. For example, the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing established a time–table to
liberalize textile trade, while the Agreement on
Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures established
a more transparent regime for trade in
agricultural goods and ensures plant and animal
health standards are followed. The WTO also
broke new ground, adding a number of trade
sectors and issues not addressed by the GATT:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS) adds services.</li>
        <li>Trade in Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs)
adds copyrights, trademarks and patents.</li>
        <li>Trade Related Investment Measures (TRIMs)
sets rules for Foreign Direct Investment.</li>
        <li>The Agreement on Government Procurement
(GPA) & the Information Technology
Agreement (ITA) are also international rules
on new product areas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These new agreements are ambitious issues
additions to the rule governing the world
trading system. However, at this stage there
are significant enforcement problems and
numerous loopholes that countries use to evade
their obligations.
<br>
<br>
The WTO differs from the GATT not only
in scope, but in institutional functioning. The
WTO has two significant functions that the
GATT did not. First, the WTO has a Trade Policy
Review Mechanism. This process periodically
accesses a country’s trade policies and notes
any changes. It is a non-judgmental, nonconfrontational process.
More controversial is the Dispute Settlement
Body and its dispute settlement panels. These
panels, composed of economists, hand down
binding judgments in trade disputes.
The WTO has 153 members, representing
more than 97% of total world trade and 30
observers, most seeking membership. The WTO
is governed by a ministerial conference, meeting
every two years; a general council, which
implements the conference’s policy decisions
and is responsible for day-to-day administration;
and a director-general, who is appointed by
the ministerial conference. The WTO’s
headquarters is at the Centre William Rappard,
Geneva, Switzerland.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Main Provisions of WTO</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>General Agreement on Trade in Services
(GATS)</i></strong></div>

The GATS applies in principle to all service
sectors except “services supplied in the exercise
of governmental authority”. These are services
that are supplied neither on a commercial basis
nor in competition with other suppliers’ viz
social security schemes and central banking.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Modes of supply</i></strong></div>
The GATS sets out four modes of supplying
services:
<br>
<br>
Mode 1: Cross-border trade
<br>
Mode 2: Consumption abroad
<br>
Mode 3: Commercial presence
<br>
Mode 4: Presence of natural persons

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mode 1</i></strong></div>

Cross-border trade corresponds with the
normal form of trade in goods and maintains a
clear geographical separation between seller and
buyer. In this case services flow from the
territory of one member into the territory of
another member crossing national frontiers.
(e.g., banking or architectural services
transmitted via telecommunications or mail).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mode 2</i></strong></div>

Consumption abroad refers to situations
where a service consumer moves into another
member’s territory to obtain a service (e.g.,
consumer travelling for tourism, medical
treatment, to attend educational establishment).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mode 3</i></strong></div>

Commercial presence is the supply of a
service through the commercial presence of the
foreign supplier in the territory of another WTO
member. In this case a service supplier of one
member establishes a territorial presence,
including through ownership or lease of
premises, in another member’s territory to
provide a service. (e.g., the es tablishment of
branch offices or agencies to deliver such services
as banking, legal advice or communications).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mode 4</i></strong></div>

Presence of natural persons involves the
admission of foreign nationals to another
country to provide services there. An Annex to
the GATS makes it clear, however, that the
agreement has nothing to do with individuals
looking for employment in another country, or
with citizenship, or residence requirements. The
members still have a right to regulate the entry
and stay of the persons concerned, for instance
by requiring visas.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>General Principles</i></strong></div>

These are basic rules that apply to all
members and to all services.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MFN Treatment</i></strong></div>

Under Article II of the GATS, “Each Member
shall accord immediately and unconditionally
to services and service suppliers of any other
Member treatment no less favourable than it
accords to like services and service suppliers of
any other country”. However, a member is
permitted to maintain a measure inconsistent
with the general MFN requirement if it has
established an exception.
However, all exemptions are subject to
review and they should in principle, not last
longer than 10 years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Transparency</i></strong></div>

The GATS requires each member to publish
promptly “all relevant measures of general
application” that affect operation of the
agreement. Members must also notify the
Council for Trade in Services of new or changed
laws, regulations or administrative guidelines
that affect trade in services covered by their
specific commitments under the agreement.
Each member is required to establish an enquiry
point, to respond to requests from other
members for information.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Specific Obligations</i></strong></div>

Obligations, which apply on the basis of
commitments, laid down in individual country
schedules concerning market access and
national treatment in specifically designated
sectors. These requirements apply only to
scheduled sectors.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Market Access</i></strong></div>

Market access is a negotiated commitment
in specified sectors. The GATS also sets out
different forms of measure affecting free market
access that should not be applied to the foreign
service or its supplier unless their use is clearly
provided for in the schedule. They are:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Limitations on the number of service suppliers</li>
            <li>Limitations on the total value of services
transactions or assets</li>
            <li>Limitations on the total number of service
operations or the total quantity of service output</li>
            <li>Limitations on the number of persons that
may be employed in a particular sector or
by a particular supplier</li>
            <li>Measures that restrict or require supply of
the service through specific types of legal
entity or joint venture</li>
            <li>Percentage limitations on the participation
of foreign capital, or limitations on the total
value of foreign investment</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Treatment</i></strong></div>

A commitment to national treatment means
that in the sectors covered by its schedule,
subjected to any conditions and qualifications
set out in the schedule, each member shall give
treatment to foreign services and service
suppliers treatment, in measures affecting
supply of services, no less favourable than it
gives to its own services and suppliers. Again,
the extension of national treatment in any
particular sector may be made subject to
conditions and qualifications. Members are free
to tailor the sector coverage and substantive
content of such commitments as they see fit.
The commitments thus tend to reflect national
policy objectives and constraints, overall and in
individual sectors. While some Members have
scheduled less than a handful of services, others
have assumed market access and national
treatment disciplines in over 120 out of a total
of 160-odd services.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Exemptions</i></strong></div>

Members in specified circumstances are
allowed to introduce or maintain measures in
contravention of their obligations under the
Agreement, including the MFN requirement or
specific commitments. These circumstance cover
measures necessary to protect public morals or
maintain public order, protect human, animal
or plant life or health or secure compliance with
laws or regulations not inconsistent with the–
Agreement including, among others, measures
necessary to prevent deceptive or fraudulent
practices.
<br>
<br>
Also, in the event of serious balance-ofpayments difficulties, members are allowed to
temporarily restrict trade, on a nondiscriminatory basis, despite the existence of
specific commitments.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indian Concerns</i></strong></div>

Services exports account for 40% of India’s
total exports of goods and services, and stood
at $86 billion in 2007–08. The contribution of
Services to India’s GDP is more than 55%. The
sector (domestic and exports) provides
employment to around 142 million people,
comprising 28% of the work force of the
country. India’s exports are mainly in the IT
and IT enabled sectors, Travel and Transport,
and Financial sectors.
<br>
<br>
The main destinations are the US (33%),
the EU (15%) and other developed countries.
India has an obvious interest in the liberalisation
of services trade and wants commercially
meaningful access to be provided by the
developed countries to fulfil the Development
Agenda of this Round. Since the Uruguay
Round, India has autonomously liberalised its
Services trade regime across the board, with
significant market access provided in core areas
of interest to the India’s interest in services lies
in the large pool of trained, qualified
experienced manpower providing services by
temporarily moving to provide services and then
returning to India (Mode 4). Trade in Mode 4
accounts for only a minuscule 1% of global
trade at the moment. India has asked for a
commitment from the developed countries in
Mode 4, inter alia in I.T and I.T Enabled Services,
Engineering Services, Health Services, Education
Services, etc. The other manner in which India
can deliver services is by way of remote supply
of services with improved connectivity and vast
pool of professionals in various services sectors
(Mode 1). It includes outsourcing, BPO, etc.
Global trade in Mode 1 accounts for only 18%
of total trade. In Mode 1, India wants developed
countries to take binding commitments in
various services sectors–Health Services, R&D
Services, Engineering & Integrated Engineering
Services, Construction and Related Services,
Computer Related Services, Professional
Services, Other Business Services like credit
reporting services, collection agency services,
telephone–based support services, data
processing services, etc. The major concern for
India in the area of services is that the markets
for services in the larger economies are not
sufficiently open, particularly in respect of
labour and labour–related services. Furthermore,
in order to realise effective access in the larger
markets, there is a need to ensure that
predictable and transparent disciplines are put
in place for Domestic Regulations so that they
are not abused to deny access or to create
barriers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trade–Related Investment Measures (TRIMs)</i></strong></div>

In the late 1980s, there was a significant
increase in foreign direct investment
throughout the world. However, some of the
countries receiving foreign investment,
imposed numerous restrictions on that
investment designed to protect and foster
domestic industries, and to prevent the outflow
of foreign exchange reserves. Examples of these
restrictions include local content requirements
(which require that locally-produced goods be
purchased or used), manufacturing
requirements (which require the domestic
manufacturing of certain components), trade
balancing requirements, domestic sales
requirements, technology transfer requirements,
export performance requirements (which
require the export of a specified percentage of
production volume), local equity restrictions,
foreign exchange restrictions, remittance
restrictions, licensing requirements, and
employment restrictions. These measures can
also be used in connection with fiscal incentives
as opposed to requirement. Some of these
investment measures distort trade in violation
of GATT Article III and XI, and are therefore
prohibited. Until the completion of the
Uruguay Round negotiations, which produced
a well-rounded Agreement on Trade-Related
Investment Measures (hereinafter the “TRIMs
Agreement”), the few international agreements
providing disciplines for measures restricting
foreign investment provided only limited
guidance in terms of content and country
coverage. The OECD Code on Liberalization of
Capital Movements, for example, requires
members to liberalize restrictions on direct
investment in a broad range of areas. The
OECD Code’s efficacy, however, is limited by
the numerous reservations made by each of the
members. In addition, there are other
international treaties, bilateral and multilateral,
under which signatories extend most-favourednation treatment to direct investment. Only a
few such treaties, however, provide national
treatment for direct investment. Moreover,
although the APEC Investment Principles
adopted in November 1994 provide rules for
investment as a whole, including nondiscrimination and national treatment, they have
no binding force.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Legal Framework</i></strong></div>

GATT 1947 prohibited investment measures
that violated the principles of national treatment
and the general elimination of quantitative
restrictions, but the extent of the prohibitions
was never clear. The TRIMs Agreement,
however, contains statements prohibiting any
TRIMs that are inconsistent with the provisions
of Articles III or XI of GATT 1994. In addition,
it provides an illustrative list that explicitly
prohibits local content requirements, trade
balancing requirements, foreign exchange
restrictions and export restrictions (domestic
sales requirements) that would violate Article
III:4 or XI:1 of GATT 1994. TRIMs prohibited
by the Agreement include those that are
mandatory or enforceable under domestic law
or administrative rulings, or those with which
compliance is necessary to obtain an advantage
(such as subsidies or tax breaks). The following
table contains a list of measures specifically
prohibited by the TRIMs Agreement. Note that
this table is not exhaustive, but simply illustrates
TRIMs that are prohibited by the TRIMs
Agreement. The table, therefore, calls particular
attention to several common types of TRIMs.
We would add that this table identifies
measures that were also inconsistent with Article
III:4 and XI:1 of GATT 1947. Indeed, the TRIMs
Agreement is not intended to impose new
obligations, but to clarify the pre–existing GATT
1947 obligations. Under the WTO TRIMs
Agreement, countries are required to rectify any
measures inconsistent with the Agreement,
within a set period of time, with a few
exceptions the second table.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS)</i></strong></div>

TRIPS contains requirements that nations’
laws must meet for copyright rights, including
the rights of performers, producers of sound
recordings and broadcasting organizations;
geographical indications, including appellations
of origin; industrial designs; integrated circuit
layout-designs; patents; monopolies for the
developers of new plant varieties; trademarks;
trade dress; and undisclosed or confidential
information. TRIPS also specify enforcement
procedures, remedies, and dispute resolution
procedures. Protection and enforcement of all
intellectual property rights shall meet the
objectives to contribute to the promotion of
technological innovation and to the transfer and
dissemination of technology, to the mutual
advantage of producers and users of
technological knowledge and in a manner
conducive to social and economic welfare, and
to a balance of rights and obligations.
The TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual
property law into the international trading
system for the first time and remains the most
comprehensive international agreement on
intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing
countries, concerned that developed countries
were insisting on an overly narrow reading of
TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in
the Doha Declaration. The Doha declaration is
a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of
TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and
should be interpreted in light of the goal “to
promote access to medicines for all.”

Impact of WTO on Indian Agriculture
For the last two decades, the concept of
WTO is highlighted in every newspaper,
electronic media, agriculture and commerce
ministries, states and central government
forums, farmer’s union, academicians, policy
makers, researchers, etc.
<br>
<br>
Especially in the Doha Development Round
of trade talks, agriculture has emerged as one
of the most important issues for negotiations.
Developing countries are particularly concerned
about the widespread use of domestic farm
subsidies by developed countries. Estimates
suggest that domestic farm support in
developed countries amounts to about 300
billion US dollars. Such huge subsidies not only
create distortion in the domestic markets of these
countries, they also distort trade by artificially
influencing commodity prices. One of the
priorities of the current round of WTO
negotiations is to bring substantial reduction in
trade distorting domestic support.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Background</i></strong></div>

The Agreement on Agriculture forms a part
of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of
Multilateral Trade Negotiations, which was
signed by the member countries in April 1994
at Marrakesh, Morocco and came into force on
1st January, 1995. The Uruguay Round marked
a significant turning point in world trade in
agriculture. For the first time, agriculture
featured in a major way in the GATT round of
multilateral trade negotiations. Although the
original GATT – the predecessor of the World
Trade Organisation (WTO) – applied to trade
in agriculture, various exceptions to the
disciplines on the use of non–tariff measures
and subsidy meant that it did not do so
effectively. The Uruguay Round agreement
sought to bring order and fair competition to
this highly distorted sector of world trade by
establishment of a fair and market oriented
agricultural trading sector. The root cause of
distortion of international trade in agriculture
has been the massive domestic subsidies given
by the industrialised countries to their
agricultural sector over many years. This in turn
led to excessive production and it’s dumping in
international markets as well as import
restrictions to keep out foreign agricultural
products from their domestic markets. Hence,
the starting point for the establishment of a fair
agricultural trade regime has to be the reduction
of domestic production subsidies given by
industrialised countries, reduction in the volume
of subsidized exports and minimum market
access opportunities for agricultural producers
world-wide.
<br>
<br>
The obligations and disciplines incorporated
in the Agreement on Agriculture, therefore,
relate to (a) market access; (b) domestic subsidy
or domestic support; and (c) export subsidy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Salient Features</i></strong></div>

The Agreement on Agriculture contains
provisions in the following three broad areas of
agriculture and trade policy:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Market Access: On market access, the
Agreement has two basic elements:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tariffication of all non–tariff barriers. That
is to say, non-tariff barriers such as
quantitative restrictions and export and
import licensing, etc. are to be replaced by
tariffs to provide the same level of
protection. Tariffs, resulting from this
“tariffication” process together with other
tariffs on agricultural products, are to be
reduced by a simple average of 36% over 6
years in the case of developed countries and
24% over 10 years in the case of developing
countries. With India being under balance
of payments cover (which is a GATTconsistent measure), we had not undertaken
any commitments with regard to market
access and this has been clearly stated in
our schedule filed under GATT. The only
commitment India has undertaken is to bind
its tariffs on primary agricultural products
at 100%; processed foods at 150%; and
edible oils at 300%.</li>
        <li>The second element relates to setting up of
a minimum level for imports of agricultural
products by member countries as a share of
domestic consumption. Countries are
required to maintain current levels (1986–
88) of access for each individual product.
Where the current level of import is
negligible, the minimum access should not
be less than 3% of the domestic
consumption, during the base period and
tariff quotas are to be established when
imports constitute less than 3% of domestic
consumption. This minimum level is to rise
to 5% by the year 2000 in the case of
developed countries and by 2004 in the case
of developing countries. However, special
Safeguards Provisions allow for the
application of additional duties when
shipments are made at prices below certain
reference levels or when there is a sudden
import surge. The market access provision,
however, does not apply when the
commodity in question is a ‘traditional
staple’ of a developing country.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Domestic support: Provisions of the
Agreement regarding domestic support have
two main objectives– first to identify
acceptable measures that support farmers
and second, to deny unacceptable, trade
distorting support to the farmers. These
provisions are aimed largely at the
developed countries where the levels of
domestic agricultural support have risen to
extremely high levels in recent decades.
All domestic support is quantified through
the mechanism of total Aggregate Measurement
of Support (AMS). AMS is a means of
quantifying the aggregate value of domestic
support or subsidy given to each category of
agricultural product. Each WTO member
country has made calculations to determine its
AMS wherever applicable. Commitment made
requires a 20% reduction in total AMS for
developed countries over 6 years. For developing
countries, this percentage is 13% and no
reduction is required for the least developed
countries. The base period external reference
price on which the reductions were calculated
was 1986-88.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

AMS consists of two parts—product-specific
subsidies and non-product specific subsidies.
Product-specific subsidy refers to the total level
of support provided for each individual
agricultural commodity, essentially signified by
procurement price in India. Non-product
specific subsidy, on the other hand, refers to
the total level of support for the agricultural
sector as a whole, i.e., subsidies on inputs such
as fertilisers, electricity, irrigation, seeds,
credit, etc.
<br>
<br>
There are three categories of support
measures that are not subject to reduction under
the Agreement, and support within specified
de minimis level is allowed. These three
categories of exempt support measures are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Measures which have a minimum impact
on trade and which meet the basic and
policy specific criteria set out in the
Agreement (the so-called Green Box
measures in the terminology of WTO). These
measures include Government assistance on
general services like (i) research, pest and
disease control, training, extension, and
advisory services; (ii) public stock holding
for food security purposes; (iii) domestic
food aid; and (iv) direct payment to
producers like governmental financial
participation in income insurance and safety
nets, relief from natural disasters, and
payments under environmental assistance
programmes.</li>
        <li>Developing country measures otherwise
subject to reduction which meet the criteria
set out in paragraph 2 of Article 6 of the
Agreement (the so-called ‘Special and
Differential Treatment’ or the S&D Box).
Examples of these are (i) investment
subsidies which are generally available to
agriculture in developing countries; and (ii)
agricultural input services generally
available to low–income and resource–poor
producers in developing countries.</li>
        <li>Direct payments under production limiting
programme which conform to the
requirement set out in paragraph 5 of
Article 6 of the Agreement (the so-called
Blue Box measures). These are relevant from
the developed countries point of view only.
Under the de minimis provision of Article
6.4 of the Agreement, there is no requirement
to reduce support in this residual category
whose value in any year, in the case of product
specific support does not exceed 10% for
developing countries of the total value of
production of the basic agricultural product in
question or of the value of total agricultural
production in the case of non-product specific
support. Where the support is below 10 per
cent, as in the case of India, product–specific
and non-specific de minimis ceiling may be
raised to those levels.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Export subsidies:</b> The Agreement on
Agriculture lists several types of subsidies
to which reduction commitments apply.
However, such subsidies are virtually nonexistent in India as exporters of agricultural
commodities do not get direct subsidy. Even
exemption of export profits from income
tax under Section 80–tHHC of the Income
Tax Act is not among the listed subsidies. It
is also worth noting that developing
countries are free to provide three of the
listed subsidies, namely, reduction of export
marketing costs, internal and international
transport and freight charges. In general, it
may be noted that the virtual explosion of
export subsidies in the industrialised
countries in the years leading to the
Uruguay Round was one of the key issues
addressed in the agricultural negotiations.
<br>
<br>
While under GATT 1947, prohibition of
export subsidies for industrial products has
been effective since 1956, in the case of
agricultural primary products, such
subsidies were only subject to limited
disciplines which, moreover, did not prove
to be operational or effective. As a result, in
the 1970s and 1980s, success in international
markets for agricultural products was
increasingly determined by the financial
power and largesse of national treasuries
rather than the efficiency and marketing
skills of agricultural producers and
exporters. Export subsidies also became a
major factor in depressing or destabilising
world market prices for many agricultural
commodities. The Uruguay Round marked
a radical departure from the earlier GATT
disciplines in the areas of agricultural export
subsidies. Members are required to reduce
the value of direct export subsidies to a level
of 36% below the 1986-90 base period level
over a six year implementation period. The
quantity of subsidized export is to be
reduced by 21% over the same period.
<br>
<br>
In the case of developing countries, the
reductions are two-thirds those of the
developed countries over a ten-year period
and there are no reductions for least
developed countries. Under the Agreement,
export subsidies are defined as “subsidies
contingent on export performance” and the
list covers export subsidy practices such as
direct export subsidies contingent on export
performance; sales of noncommercial stocks
of agricultural products for export at prices
lower than comparable prices for such
goods in the domestic markets; producerfinanced subsidies such as government
programmes which require a levy on
production which is then used to subsidise
the export of the product; cost-reduction
measures such as subsidies to reduce
marketing costs for exports including
handling costs and costs of international
freight; internal transport subsidies applying
only to exports; subsidies on incorporated
products i.e., subsidies on agricultural
products such as wheat contingent on their
incorporation in export products made of
wheat, etc. All such export subsidies are
subject to reduction commitments in terms
of both the volume of subsidised export and
budgetary outlays for such subsidies. As
indicated earlier, such measures are virtually
non-existent in India and, hence, the issue
of reduction of export subsidy on
agricultural products is not of particular
relevance for India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Product Coverage</i></strong></div>

The Agreement defines agricultural products
by reference to the harmonised system of
product classification. The definition covers not
only basic agricultural products such as wheat,
milk and live animals, but the products derived
from them such as bread, butter, other dairy
products and meat, as well as all processed
agricultural products such as chocolates and
sausages. The coverage includes wines, spirits
and tobacco products, fibres such as cotton,
wool and silk, and raw animal skins destined
for leather production. Fish and fish products
are not included nor are forestry products.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Implementation Period</i></strong></div>

The implementation period for the
country-specific commitments is the six-year
period commencing in 1995. However,
developing countries have the flexibility to
implement their reduction and other specific
commitments over a period of up to 10 years.
Members had the choice of implementing their
concessions and commitments on the basis of
calendar, marketing (crop) or fiscal years. A
WTO Member’s implementation year for tariff
reduction may thus differ from the one applied
to export subsidy reductions. For the purpose
of the ‘peace clause’ the implementation
period is the nine-year period commencing in
1995.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Implications of the Agreement</i></strong></div>

Implications of the Agreement would differ
from country to country and would depend
largely on the overall agricultural scenario in
the country. Indian agriculture is characterised
by a preponderant majority of small and
marginal farmers holding less than two hectares
of land, less than 35.7% of the land, is under
any assured irrigation system and for the large
majority of farmers, the gains from the
application of the science & technology in
agriculture are yet to be realised. Farmers,
therefore, require support in terms of
development of infrastructure as well as
extension of improved technologies and
provisions of requisite inputs at reasonable cost.
India’s share of world’s agricultural trade is of
the order of 1%. There is no doubt that during
the last 30 years, Indian agriculture has grown
at a reasonable pace, but with stagnant and
declining net cropped area it is indeed going to
be a formidable task to maintain the growth in
agricultural production. The implications of the
Agreement would thus have to be examined in
the light of the food demand and supply
situation. The size of the country, the level of
overall development, balance of payments
position, realistic future outlook for agricultural
development, structure of land holdings, etc.
are the other relevant factors that would have
a bearing on India’s trade policy in agriculture.
<br>
<br>
Implications of the Agreement on Agriculture
for India should thus be gauged from the impact
it will have on the following:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether the Agreement has opened up
markets and facilitated exports of our
products;</li>
        <li>Whether we would be able to continue with
our domestic policy aimed at improving
infrastructure and provision of inputs at
subsidised prices for achieving increased
agricultural production.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Implications–Short Term</i></strong></div>

As far as opening of markets and impact
on trade in agriculture is concerned, it may be
noted that the share of developing countries in
world exports of food remained at 44% and of
agricultural raw materials increased
insignificantly from 32% in 1994 to 34% in 1996
that is the post-Agreement period. The average
growth of developed countries imports of
agricultural products increased by just 1%
during 1994-96. Nearer home, agricultural
exports of ten Asian developing countries
increased from US $ 49252 million in 1994 to
US $ 55902 million in 1996. India’s share in
total agricultural exports from developing Asia
is 8%, behind China’s 19%, Thailand’s 17%,
Malaysia’s 14% and Indonesia’s 10%. India’s
exports of agricultural products have increased
from US $ 4151 million in 1993-94 to US $
7054 million in 1997-98. No tangible opening
up of the markets has thus been noticed in the
post–Agreement period so far. However, it may
be premature on this basis to assess the longterm impact of the Agreement on opening up
of markets.
<br>
<br>
Regarding freedom to pursue our domestic
policies, it is quite evident that in the short term
India will not be affected by the WTO
Agreement on Agriculture. The safeguards
provided for developing countries give enough
manoeuvres to insulate ourselves from any
major impact of trade liberalisation in
agricultural commodities.
<br>
var
India has been maintaining quantitative
restrictions (QRs) on import of 825 agricultural
products as on 1.4.97. QRs are proposed to be
eliminated within the overall time frame of six
years in three phases – 1.4.97 to 31.3.2003. (All
our trading partners barring the US have agreed
to this phase-out plan and dispute with the US
is pending with Dispute Settlement Body of
WTO for adjudication). Within the provisions
of the GATT Agreement India has bound tariffs
at high levels of 100%, 150% and 300% for
primary products, processed products and
edible oils respectively.
Therefore, the QRs can be replaced with
high import tariff in case we want to restrict
imports of these commodities.
<br>
<br>
In India, for the present, the minimum
support price provided to commodities is less
than the fixed external reference price
determined under the Agreement. Therefore,
the AMS is negative. Theoretically, therefore,
we could increase the product-specific support
up to 10%, the only restraint being the fiscal
sustainability in the country’s context.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Implications–Long Term</i></strong></div>

As mentioned earlier, for a large majority
of farmers in different parts of the country, the
gains from the application of science and
technology in agriculture are yet to be realised
which would require infrastructural support,
improved technologies and provision of inputs
at reasonable cost. The Agreement on Agriculture
thus recognised this and developing countries
have been given the freedom to implement such
policies under Article 6 relating to differential
treatment, but any attempt in future to dilute
provisions relating to differential treatment for
developing countries could affect us adversely.
Regarding the impact of liberalisation of
trade in agriculture in the long term, Indian
agriculture enjoys the advantage of cheap
labour. Therefore, despite the lower
productivity, a comparison with world prices
of agricultural commodities would reveal that
domestic prices in India are considerably less
with the exceptions of a few commodities
(notably oilseeds). Hence, imports to India
would not be attractive in the case of rice, tea,
sunflower oil and cotton. On the whole, large
scale import of agricultural commodities as a
result of trade liberalisation is ruled out. Even
the exports of those foodgrains which are
cheaper in the domestic market, but are sensitive
from the point of view of consumption by the
economically weaker sections are not likely to
rise to unacceptable levels because of high
inland transportation cost and inadequate
export infrastructure in India. Through proper
tariffication, however, we will have to strike a
balance between the competing interest of 10%
farmers who generate marketable surpluses and
consumers belonging to the economically poor
sections of the society.
<br>
<br>
It is also argued that because of increasing
price of domestic agricultural commodities
following improved export prospects, farmers
would get benefits which in turn would
encourage investment in the resource scarce
agricultural sector. With the decrease in
production subsidies as well as export subsidies,
the international prices of agricultural
commodities will rise and this will help in
making our exports more competitive in world
market. Given our agro diversity, we have the
potential to increase our agro exports in a
substantial way. In the words of Shri A.V.
Ganesan, “There will be growing pressure from
the farmers to realise higher prices for their
produce and to narrow the gap between the
domestic and external prices. Our industrialists
are pressing for a ‘level playing field’ vis-a-vis
foreign enterprises; our farmers will press for a
‘level playing field’ for the prices of their
products vis-a-vis international prices. Both the
pattern of production and price expectations
will increasingly be influenced by the demands
and trends in world markets. On the one hand,
the price incentive could be the best incentive
and could give a strong boost to investment in
agriculture as well as adoption of modern
technologies and thereby to the raising of
agricultural production and productivity. On
the other hand, the rise in domestic prices would
put pressure on the public distribution system
and accentuate the problem of food subsidy.
<br>
<br>
Furthermore, freedom to export agricultural
products without restrictions will also need
shedding the long–nurtured inhibition against
their imports. The nature and character of State
intervention and State support will have to
undergo qualitative changes in order not only
to realise the opportunities for exports, but also
to cope with the implications of our agriculture
coming into increasing alignment with the
international market place”.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Doha Round</i></strong></div>

Non Tariff Measures (NTMs) are all
measures on international trade that are not in
the form of a tariff or a tax. These measures
include trade related procedures such as
documentation, certification and inspections;
technical regulations; standards; import related
measures such as restrictions, prohibitions,
seasonal duties, tariff rate quotas; foreign
exchange controls including artificial exchange
rates; public procurement practices, etc. Certain
NTMs such as imposition of anti-dumping and
safeguard duties have the effect of tariffs. On
the other hand, some measures are intended to
protect human, animal and plant, life and
health, and are known as sanitary and
phytosanitary (SPS) measures.
<br>
<br>
Non Tariff Barriers (NTBs) are a sub-set of
NTMs which violate the obligations under the
Agreements of the WTO. Therefore, NTBs are
unfair measures which serve to discriminate
against imports.
<br>
<br>
The NAMA negotiations focussed on the
listing of NTBs by countries. Subsequently, the
Negotiating Group went into text based
negotiations on various proposals.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Last Status</i></strong></div>

In the draft NAMA modalities of 6 December,
2008, there were 13 NTB textual proposals listed
in Annex 5. These could be categorised as:
Horizontal proposals (those related across sectors)
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Ministerial Decision on Procedures for the
Facilitation of Solutions to Non–Tariff Barriers
(known as the Horizontal Mechanism)</li>
        <li>Decision on the elimination of Non-Tariff
Barriers imposed as unilateral trade measures</li>
        <li>Ministerial Decision on Trade in
Remanufactured Goods</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vertical proposals (related to specific sectors)</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Export related proposals</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Revised submission on Export Taxes</li>
        <li>Protocol on Transparency in Export
Licensing to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade 1994</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li><b>TBT (Technical Barriers to Trade) related
proposals</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Understanding on the Interpretation of the
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
as Applied to Trade in Fireworks</li>
        <li>Understanding on the Interpretation of the
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
as Applied to Trade in Lighter Products</li>
        <li>Understanding on the Interpretation of the
Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
as Applied to Trade in Electronics</li>
        <li>Decision on non–tariff barriers affecting
forestry products used in building
construction</li>
        <li>Agreement on Non–Tariff Barriers
Pertaining to the Electrical Safety and
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC) of

        <li>Negotiating Proposal on Non–Tariff Barriers

Sector</li>
        <li>Understanding on the Interpretation of the

Clothing, Footwear, and Travel Goods</li>
        <li>Agreement on NTBs pertaining to
standards, technical regulations and
conformity assessment procedures for
automotive products.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

While listing these 13 proposals, the NAMA
text states that 7 of the proposals merit
particular attention which includes the
proposals on the horizontal mechanism;
remanufactured goods; TBT proposals on
electronics (2 in number); vertical proposals on
automotives; labelling in textiles, clothing,
footwear and travel goods; and chemical
products. Subsequently, the EC came out with
its proposal on automobiles thereby putting 14
NTB proposals on the table.
<br>
<br>
While most proposals have little support
and are unlikely to achieve consensus, the three
key proposals under discussion are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>“Ministerial Decision on Procedures for the
Facilitation of Solutions to NTBs” known as
the Horizontal Mechanism</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

This Horizontal Mechanism was originally
mooted by the NAMA 11(of which India is a
Member) and European Communities (EC)
with the support of more than 100 Members
namely the African Group, Canada, LDCs, New
Zealand, Norway, Pakistan and Switzerland.
The Mechanism is an informal dispute resolution
mechanism that explores trade solutions without
affecting the rights and obligations under the
WTO Agreements. It operates through the
existing WTO Committee’s, takes the help of
an expert in the respective field and enables
faster and more economical resolution of NTBs
especially those on products of export interest
for developing countries.
<br>
<br>
The Procedures have the following salient
features:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The procedures are intended to explore trade
solutions to the NTB without getting into
the rights and obligations under the WTO
Agreement.</li>
        <li>The first stage is of information exchange
between the requesting and responding
Member which seeks to ensure
transparency. This is non confidential and
is circulated to the WTO Committee.</li>
        <li>The Chairman or Vice Chairman get
associated at this stage since they call a
meeting for addressing any outstanding
issues and explore possible steps forward.</li>
        <li>Third parties can join in based on consent
of the two parties and on terms and
conditions decided upon by them.</li>
        <li>The second stage is purely mandatory at
the consent of both parties. It involves the
appointment of a facilitator which is by
mutual consent or else selected by the
Chairman of the Council of Trade in Goods
(CTG) after consulting the parties.</li>
        <li>This stage has flexible procedures in terms
of the venue, means of communication,
exploration of possible solutions, etc. The
emphasis is on reaching a mutually agreed
solution. The entire proceedings and content
of the discussions in this stage are
confidential.</li>
        <li>If a mutually agreed solution is reached,
the facilitator will submit a draft report on
the NTB, procedures followed and the
solution arrived at. This has to be vetted by
the parties and then submitted to the
Committee.</li>
        <li>While the solution may be trade related, it
should not impinge on the rights and
obligations of Members under the WTO
Agreements.</li>
        <li>The procedures would be useful especially
for developing countries in the context of
the economical and expeditious nature of
the decision making. It would also
strengthen the WTO Committees especially
in the context of their decision making.</li>
        <li>Ministerial Decision on Trade in
Remanufactured Goods</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The salient features of the proposal driven
by the US are that it seeks to enhance market
access opportunities for remanufactured goods,
it seeks a review of the non tariff measures on
importation of remanufactured goods so that
they are in compliance with multilateral
obligations and putting in place an institutional
framework for consultations as well as
discussing progress in reduction or elimination
of non tariff barriers on remanufactured goods.
Some of the concerns on this proposal are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no conceptual clarity on
remanufacturing and the suggested
definition in the textual NTB proposal does
not capture the concept of remanufacturing
across various sectors.</li>
        <li>Re-manufactured imports would adversely
affect the domestic manufacturing sector
especially the unorganised sector and SMEs.</li>
        <li>It could serve as a conduit for dumping of
waste (including e waste) into developing
countries due to stringent standards
elsewhere.</li>
        <li>Without any extended producer liability
(EPL) for re-manufactured products, there
could be grave environmental implications</li>
        <li>Issues of customs valuation, misclassification
and intellectual property protection on
imports of re-manufactured products would
crop up.</li>
        <li>Remanufacturing cannot generate the same
level of employment or value addition as
manufacture of the new goods.</li>
        <li>In the absence of standards, technical
regulations and conformity assessment
procedures (both domestic and global) for
remanufactured goods, there is a possibility
of environmental norms being flouted.</li>
        <li>One needs to look at a Work Programme
wherein all these issues are discussed and
thereby generates greater clarity.</li>
        <li>TBT Related Proposals</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

9 out of the 14 NTB proposals are vertical
in nature relating to specific NAMA sectors.
They would also have a legal relationship with
the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade
(TBT Agreement) and would affect some of the
provisions of the latter. It was in this context
that India took a decision to seek a horizontal
solution to specific NTB in NAMA sectors while
retaining some elements of the vertical solutions
wherever it was applicable. This was to ensure
