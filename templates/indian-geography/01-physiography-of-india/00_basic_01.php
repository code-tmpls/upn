<h3>Physiography Of India</h3>


India is the seventh largest and second most
populous country in the world. Its area is 2.4% of
the total world area but about 16% of the entire
human races reside in its fold. In population, only
the mainland china exceeds that of India.
<br>
<br>
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and
Bhutan form the well-defined realm of south Asia
often referred to as the Indian sub-continent.
Lying entirely in the northern hemisphere
(tropical zone), the Indian mainland extends
between the latitude - 8°
4' N to 37°
6’N and
longitude - 68°
7' E to 97°
25’E. The southernmost
point in the Indian territory, the Indira Point, is
situated at 6°
30' north in the Andaman and
Nicobar islands. The tropic of cancer passes
through the centre of India.
<br>
<br>
India covers an area of 3,287 sq. Km. and
measures about 3,214 km. from north to south and
about 2,933 Km east to west. The total length of
the mainland coastland is nearly 6,200 km and
land frontier about 15,200 km.
The boundary line between India and China
is called the McMahon line. To the north-west,
India, shares a boundary mainly with Pakistan
and to the east with Myanmar and Bangladesh.
The Indian Ocean lies in the south. In the south,
on the eastern side, the Gulf of Mannar and the
Palk Strait separate India from Sri Lanka. The
Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of
Bengal and the Lakshadweep islands in the
Arabian Sea are parts of the Indian territory.
India’s relief is marked by a great variety.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>India can be divided into five major
physiographic units:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Northern Mountains</li>
        <li>The Great Northern Plains</li>
        <li>The Peninsular Plateau</li>
        <li>The Coastal Plains</li>
        <li>The Islands</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Northern Mountains</i></strong></div>

The mountain ranges and plateaus of the
north Kashmir, the Himalayas and the hill ranges
of Nagaland, East Assam, Manipur and Mizoram
from a conspicuous mountain system bordering
the country in the North.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HIMALAYAS</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Greater Himalayas/Himadri/ Inner
Himalayas:</b> They comprise the northern most
ranges having an average height of 6000 m with
breadth ranging from 120 to 190 km. Conforming
the syntaxial bend to the underlying rocks, it is
an asymmetrical mountain throwing very few
spurs southward.
Important peaks of this system include Mt.
Everest (8,848 m) at Kathmandu in Nepal,
Kanchanjunga (8,598 m), Dhaulagiri (8,172 m)
Nanda Devi (7,817m) Nanga Parbat (8,126m).
Important passes are Bara Lacha La and Shipki
La (in Himachal Pradesh), Thaga La Niti Pass and
Lipulekh (Uttarakhand); Nathu La and Jelep La,
(Sikkim); and Burzil pass and Zojila pass
(Kashmir).</li>
        <li><b>The Lesser/ Middle Himalayas:</b> They
have an average height of about 3,500 to 5,000
metres and average width of 60 to 80 km. It
extends in the North of Siwalik range. Important
ranges include the Dhauladhar, the Pir Panjal and
the Musoorie range. Hills and resorts are Shimla,
Musoorie, Nainital, Almora, Darjeeling etc.</li>
        <li><b>The Outer Himalayas/Shiwaliks:</b> They
are the foothills running parallel to the
Himalayas. Average height is 1,000 to 1,500
metres. It is a chain of low-lying hills formed
through fluvial deposits like sand, clay and
pebbles. Dehradun valley; Udhampur and Kotli
valleys have developed into good human
settlements.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Siwalik or Outer Himalayas is a hogback
structure formed of river born deposits in the
latest phase of Himalayas uplift in Middle
Miocene to lower Pleistocene age. It descends
northwards to flat-floored structured valleys
called “Duns”. It is covered with thick tropical
wet deciduous forests in the east.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TRANS-HIMALAYAS</i></strong></div>

They comprise Karakoram and the Kailash
mountain systems. Mt. K2
 (Godwin Austin -
8,611m) which is now in Pakistan occupied
Kashmir is located in the Karakoram. Another
important peak is Hidden Peak (8,068m). The
Siachen glacier (72km) - largest in India is situated
in Nubra valley in this region. Other glaciers are
Baltoro (60 km), Biafo (60 km) and Hispar (62 km).


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PURVANCHAL OR EASTERN HILLS</i></strong></div>

After crossing the Dihang gorge in the east,
the Himalayas bend towards South forming a
series of hills with a north-south direction, convex
side facing the west. These hills are made up of
sedimentary rocks and are highly dissected. Their
heights vary from 500m to 3,000m. The ‘Patkai
Bum’ forms the boundary between India
(Arunachal Pradesh) and Burma. Further South
is the Naga Hills, boundary between Nagaland
and which forms Burma. Saramati (3,826m) is the
highest peak. Garo, Khasi, Jaintia, Mikir, Dapha,
Mini and Abor are other important hills of the
north-eastern region. Mawsynram with
maximum rainfall in the world is located on the
Khasi hills in Meghalaya.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>REGIONAL DIVISIONS OF HIMALAYA</i></strong></div>

Region wise, the Himalayas are divided into;

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Great Northern Plains</i></strong></div>

The great plains are an aggradational surface
of great extent formed after the Himalayas. These
are formed by the Indus, the Ganga and
Brahmaputra rivers. The Great Plains stretch in
the east-west direction between the Himalayas
in the north and the peninsular plateau in the
south. Width varies from 500 km in PunjabRajasthan to 200 km. in Bihar. It covers an area of
over 7 lakh sq. km. Important characteristics
include - Bhabar (unsorted sediments), Terai
(Marshy tract) Bhangar (older alluvium) and
Khadar (newer alluvium)
<br>
<br>
The Great Northern plains consist of the
following regions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Punjab-Haryana Plains: They are
drained by the tributaries of river Indus, Ravi,
Beas and Satluj. These plains are flat with an
average elevation of 200 to 240 metres. These
fertile plains include the Bari Doab (between Ravi
and Beas rivers) and Bist Doab (between Beas and
Satluj)</li>
        <li>The Rajasthan Plains: They cover an area
of 1.75 lakh sq. km. in Rajasthan and its adjoining
states. It includes the Marusthali of Thar desert
and bagar tract west of the Aravallis. The region
is one of the dry river beds (Saraswati) and
shifting sand dunes. River Luni is an inland
drainage river. Sambhar, Kuchaman, Didwana
and Pachbhadra are the salt lakes of this region.</li>
        <li>The Ganga Plains : The Ganga plains of
U.P., Bihar and West Bengal occupy an area of
3.57 lakh sq. km. Important rivers of this region
are the Ganga, the Yamuna, the Gandak, the Son
and the Kosi. The Bengal basin is mainly
composed of the Ganga delta.</li>
        <li>The Brahmaputra Plains: It contains
alluvial deposits of the Brahmaputra and its
tributaries the Subansiri, Dibang and the Lohit.
It is a flood prone area because the slope of the
valley is too gentle to drain away the large volume
of rainfall in monsoon season.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Peninsular Plateau</i></strong></div>

The Peninsular plateau, which covers an area
of about 16 lakh sq. km., is the largest
physiographic division of the country. It has
senile topographical features. The Aravallis form
its boundary in the north-west, Rajmahal Hills in
the north and north-east. South of about 220
N
latitude, the Sahyadris (Western Ghats) and the
Eastern Ghats form the western and eastern
boundaries respectively.
<br>
<br>
On the basis of variation in relief, further
divisions of the Peninsular Plateau may be made
as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The Aravalli Range:</b> It is one of the oldest
fold mountains of the world. The highest peak is
Gurushikhar (1,722m) in Mount Abu Hills. The
Delhi Ridge marks the northern end of the range.</li>
        <li><b>The Central Plateau:</b> It consists of Plateau
of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Average
height is 250-300m. The Malwa Plateau in
Madhya Pradesh lies in the north of Vindhyas.
The Plateau is largely broken. The Chambal
ravine is an important feature. The area between
the Yamuna and Vindhyan Plateau is called
Bundelkhand Plateau. It lies in the east of Maikal
ranges and south of river Son. Important rivers
of the region are the Rihand and Son.</li>
        <li><b>The Vindhya Range:</b> It is an escarpment
running in east-west direction. Kaimur Hills form
its eastern portion.</li>
        <li><b>The Satpura Range:</b> It lies between
Narmada and Tapti (Tapi) valleys latitudinally.
The plateau is formed of lava. The highest point
of Satpura range is Dhupgarh in Panchmarhi
(1,350m). The eastern part of the range is Maikal
Plateau.</li>
        <li><b>The Eastern Plateau and the Chhotanagpur
Plateau:</b> East of the Maikal Hills lies the
Baghelkhand Plateau. South of the Baghelkhand
is Chhattisgarh Basin. Further south is Bastar
Plateau or Dandakaranya.</li>
The Chotanagpur Plateau lies in the east of
Baghelkhand Plateau. It has an average height of
700m. It has a radial drainage. The Damodar river
originates near Tori in Palamau. Damodar valley
project is located here. The Chotanagpur Plateau
ends in Rajmahal Hills.
        <li><b>The Kathiawar and Kutch Peninsula:</b>
They have an Archaean structure but are surfaced
by tertiary rocks. It tapers into the Arabian Sea.</li>
        <li><b>The Deccan Plateau:</b> It is located within
the Satpura-Mahadeo-Maikal ranges in the north,
the Eastern Ghats in the East and the Western
Ghats in the west. It is slightly titled towards
south-east. The peninsula is triangular in shaperising 
from 500 to 1,000m. Amarkantak (1,057m)
and Dhupgarh (1,350m) are important peaks.</li>
        <li><b>The Western Ghats or the Sahyadris:</b>
They form the western edge of the Deccan
Plateau. Starting from Khandesh, south of Tapi
and running southward parallel along the
western coast for 1600 km, it reaches
Kanyakumari and joins the Eastern Ghats at
Nilgiri Hills. Kalsubai (1,646m), Mahabaleshwar
(1,438m) and Harishchandra are among the
highest peaks in this part of the ghats. Thalghat
and Bhorghat are important passes through
which roads and railways run between the
Deccan Plateau and the Konkan plains.
Kudremukh (1,894m), Pushpagiri (1,714m) and
Brahmagiri peak lie south of Coorg.
The highest peak of the Nilgiri Hills is
Dodabeta (2,637m) situated near Ootacamund.
Udyogmandal (Ooty) is an important hill resort.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Palghat Gap:</b> It connects Tamil Nadu and
Kerala and is located south of the Nilgiri,
separating the Cardamom Hills from the Nilgiris.
Further south of the Palghat Gap, there are the
Annamalai Hills and the Palni Hills in the north
east. The culmination point of these hills is the
Anai Mudi Peak (2,695m) with the distinction of
being the highest peak of South India.</li>
        <li><b>The Eastern Ghats:</b> They form the eastern
boundary of the Deccan Plateau. They are broken
as compared to the Western Ghats. The highest
point (1,680m) is in the Visakhapatnam district,
Mahendragiri (1,501m).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The most important hill in the Cuddapah
Range is Nallamalla Hills. The Southern part of
Nallamalla is called Palkonda Range. Javadi Hills
in North Arcot and Ginjee Hills in South Arcot
and Pachaimalai in Tamil Nadu, form the others
hills of the Eastern Ghat.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Coastal Plains</i></strong></div>

It occurs along the shores of the Bay of Bengal
and the Arabian Sea. The Plains are narrower
along the west coast than the east coast. A number
of deltas occur on the east coast because the
gradient is less steep.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>The West Coastal Plains:</b> It spreads its
structure from the Rann of Kutch to Kanyakumari
for about 1,500 km. The Gujarat plain is formed
by the Sabarmati, Mahi and several other rivers.
The Karnataka coast extends south of Goa for
about 525 km. The Sharavati is an important river.
The region has several rocky cliffs. The Kerala
plain extends from south of Cannanore to Cape
Comorin for about 500 km.</li>
        <li><b>The East Coastal Plains:</b> Extends from the
mouth of Subarnarekha to Kanyakumari for about
1,100 km. Its average width is 120 km. The East
Coast is much wider and contains many deltas.
The Krishna and Godavari form large delta.
Kolleru Lake is located between Krishna and
Godavari. The Pulicat Lake is a lagoon (salt water
lake) separated from the sea by Sriharikota Island.
The Utkal plains include the Mahanadi delta.
Chilka Lake, south of Mahanadi delta is an
important Lagoon.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Islands</i></strong></div>

India has in all 247 islands of which 204 lie in
the Bay of Bengal and remaining in the Arabian
Sea and Gulf of Mannar between India and Sri
Lanka.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Andaman and Nicobar</b> are two major
groups of Islands in the Bay of Bengal. These are
extensions of the Arakan Yoma of Burma.
The islands in the Arabian Sea have a coral
origin and are surrounded by fringing reefs.
Lakshadweep (32 sq. km. area) is important for
coral reefs. Further south of it is Minicoy islands.
It is the largest with an area of 4.5 sq. km.
Rameshwaram Island which lies just off the Tamil
Nadu coast, between India and Sri Lanka, is also
of coral origin.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lakes</i></strong></div>

Lakes in India are mainly found in
mountainous or coastal regions. The plains have
few lakes. On the basis of their origin they can be
classified as under:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Tectonic lakes- Wular lake (Kashmir),
Kumayun Lake</li>
            <li>Lakes formed due to volcanic activityLunar Lake (Maharashtra)</li>
            <li>Lagoon lakes- Chilka (Orissa), Pulicat (Tamil
Nadu), Kolleru (Andhra Pradesh).</li>
            <li>Glacial lakes- Khurpa Taal, Samtaal,

(Gujarat), Sukhna (Chandigarh).</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>



    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Drainage System</i></strong></div>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Concepts</i></strong></div>

<b>Tributary:</b> A river or stream which
contributes its water to a main river. For example,
the Yamuna is the tributary of the Ganga.
<br>
<b>Distributary:</b> A branch or outlet which leaves
a main river and does not rejoin it, carrying its
water to the sea or a lake.
<br>
<b>Delta:</b> A triangular shaped alluvial tract,
formed at the mouth of a river. For instance the
delta of the Ganges is the largest delta in the
world.
<br>
<b>Doab:</b> The alluvial tract of land between two
adjacent rivers, e.g. the plain between the Ganges
and the Yamuna.
<br>
<b>Catchment Basin (Drainage Area):</b> The
region which drains all the river water that falls
on it into a river or stream.
<br>
<b>Breakwater:</b> A barrier built into the sea in
order to break the force of the waves and thus to
serve as a protection against them.
<br>
<b>Estuary:</b> The mouth of a river where tidal
effects are felt and where fresh water and sea
water mix.
<br>
<b>Drainage Patterns:</b> River and its tributaries
drain an area, which is called a ‘river basin’. Its
boundary formed by the crest line of the
surrounding highland is the watershed of the basin.
A river system usually develops a pattern
which is related to the general structure of the
basin.
<br>
<br>
A dendritic pattern develops in a region made
of rocks which offer some resistance to erosion
and which has a uniform structure. A trellis
drainage pattern develops in a region made up
of alternate belts of hard and soft rocks all of
which dip in the same direction and which lie at
right angles to the general slope, down which the
river flows. A radial pattern develops on a dome
or volcanic cone.
<br>
<br>
Classification of Drainage System: Over 90%
of India’s land surface drains into the Bay of
Bengal and almost all the remaining area drains
into the Arabian Sea. Only a very small area in
Rajasthan has an inland drainage.
 Our river system can be classified into:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Himalayan River System</li>
        <li>The Peninsular River System
The Himalayan rivers fall into four broad groups:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Pre-Himalayan Rivers: Arun, Indus, Satluj
and Brahmaputra.</li>
        <li>Great-Himalayan Rivers: Ganga, Kali,
Ghaghra, Gandak, Tista etc.</li>
        <li>Lesser -Himalayan Rivers: Beas, Ravi,
Chenab, Jhelum etc.</li>
        <li>Siwalik Rivers: Hindan, Sonali etc.
The peninsular rivers fall into two categories,
viz., the coastal rivers and the inland rivers. The
former are comparatively small streams. The
west-coast rivers are of great importance.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Although only 3 percent of the areal extent of the
basins of India is drained by these rivers, as much
as 14 percent of the country’s water resources are
contained by them.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rivers rising from the Western Ghats:</b> the
Godavari, the Krishna, the Cauvery, the
Pennar, the Palar, the Vaigai etc.</li>
        <li><b>Rivers flowing into the Arabian Sea:</b> The
Narmada, the Tapi, the Sharavati etc.</li>
        <li><b>Rivers originating in the Vindhyas and
Satpura but flowing north-east towards
Ganga:</b> The Chambal, the Betwa, the
Damodar, the Son, the Ken etc. The
Narmada and the Tapi flow in the fault
created by them during the Himalayan
uplift.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
