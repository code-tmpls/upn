<h3>Climate of India</h3>


The climate of India is broadly, of the tropical
monsoon type. The word monsoon (Arabic:
Mausim) stands for seasonal reversal in the wind
pattern and accounts for and is associated with
the rhythm of season, changes in the direction of
winds, distribution pattern of rainfall and
temperature with the change of seasons.
However, the regional variations in climate can’t
be ignored. These variations are expressed in
terms of winds, rainfall, temperature and
humidity. Main factors deciding the local climate
are location, altitude and distance from general
relief.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mechanism of Indian weather</i></strong></div>

India has wide regional variations in terms
of winds, rainfall, temperature, humidity etc.
These differences in local climate are produced
by the following factors:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Surface distribution of pressure and winds;</li>
        <li>Upper air circulation caused by factors
controlling global weather and the inflow
of different air masses and jet streams; and</li>
        <li>Inflow of western disturbances and tropical
depressions into India creating weather
phenomena leading to rainfall.
Seasons</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

On the basis of monsoonal variation, there are
four seasons in India.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Cold Weather Season: (December to
February): Mainly felt in North India - an
important event of the season is the inflow of the
depression from the west to the north-west. These
low pressure systems, called Western
disturbances, originate in West Asia and travel
towards India causing some rain and snowfall in
winter months in north and north-eastern India.
The temperature increases from north to
south. The isotherms run parallel to the latitudes.
20° isotherm runs east-west through the middle
part of India. By the mid-December in the northwest India a series of shallow cyclonic
disturbances is observed. The rainfall is mostly
confined to Punjab & Haryana Plains, North-east
Rajasthan, Kashmir and western U.P. In northern
India it is very useful for Rabi crops.</li>
        <li>The Hot Weather Season (March to May):
Because of the heating of the subcontinent, the
equatorial trough moves northward and lies at
25°N in July. This trough attracts surface winds
from South - Westerly direction along the West
Coast and from north, north - Westerly direction
along the Bengal Coast. The northward shift of
equatorial trough and the excessive heating of the
Himalayan and the central Asian highlands are
responsible for generating the monsoon, the
influx of monsoon in mid - June changes the
season to the rainy one.
<br>
<br>
Tornado-like dust storm of Punjab and
Haryana; the “Andhis” of U.P. and the
“Kalbaishakhis” of West Bengal involving strong
convection movements causes some precipitation.
The “Norwesters” (Kalbaishakhis of West Bengal)
originate over the Chotanagpur Plateaus and
blow in the north east direction which bring about
50cm of rainfall in Assam and about 10cm rainfall
in West Bengal and Orissa. This rainfall is very
useful for Assam Tea and spring rice crops of
West Bengal.
<br>
<br>
Similar thunderstorm causes about 25cm
rainfall in Karnataka which is locally called as
“Cherry Blossom”, beneficial to the coffee
plantation and “Mango Showers” elsewhere in
South India, which are of salutary effect on the
mango crop. “Loo”, a hot wind blows in the
northern plain during May and June, with the
temperature range of 45°C to 50°C.</li>
        <li>The South - West Monsoon Season (June
to September): The ‘monsoon burst’ brings about
the sudden onset of rain on different dates in
different parts of India. The Arabian Sea current
covers West Coast, Maharashtra, Gujarat and
parts of Madhya Pradesh, whereas the Bay of
Bengal current strikes the Bengal coast and the
Shillong plateau and moves West and north -
west, parallel to the Himalayas and brings rain
to Bihar, U.P., Delhi etc. The two currents merge
over Punjab. The tropical depressions, which
periodically occur, cause dry spells during the
monsoon season. So these depressions determine
the amount of rainfall The East Coast of India
remains dry during this season of June -
September, since it is in the rain shadow area of
the western current and is parallel to the Bengal
current.
<br>
<br>
The normal date of onset of the S.W. -
Monsoon is 20th May in Andaman and Nicobar
Island, 1st June on Kerala coast and by 15th July
it covers whole of India. The withdrawal of
monsoon is much more gradual process than its
onset. Normally it withdraws from north-west
India by the beginning of October and from
remaining part of India by the beginning of
December. Out of the total moisture brought by
the monsoon, only 20 percent is precipitated in
India.
<br>
<br>
Arabian Sea branch causes the first monsoonburst over the Kerala coast normally by 5th June
and later on causes heavy rain along the western
coast, while the large part of Deccan lies in a rain
shadow of the Western Ghats and receive
decreasing amount of rainfall. The Arabian Sea
branch does not brings much rain to Gujarat and
Rajasthan mainly due to absence of a mountain
barrier, but gives moderate to heavy rainfall in
the foothills of Western Himalayas, Eastern
Punjab and North-eastern Rajasthan. The Arabian
Sea branch is much more powerful than the Bay
of Bengal branch.
The Bay of Bengal branch after crossing the
deltaic region enters the Khasi Valley and
entrapped within it due to funnel shape of the
region and strikes Cherrapunji in a perpendicular
direction causing heaviest rainfall near
“Mawsynram” (1143cm). A series of depression
are originated at the head of Bay of Bengal and
travel in a north westerly direction across central
and northern India causes heavy rainfall along
their tracks, with the frequency of 2 to 4
depressions per month from June to September.</li>
        <li>The North - East Monsoon (October to
December): The retreat of South-West monsoon
from North India starts in September and is
gradual. During this season, severe cyclonic
storms develop in the Bay of Bengal which moves
in a South-easterly to North-Westerly direction.
They give substantial amount of rainfall to the
East coast and sometimes cause havoc in Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal. In Tamil
Nadu and surrounding areas, it is known as the
north east monsoon period.
<br>
<br>
Generally the withdrawal of monsoon starts
from 1st September in the north-western India
and is completed in mid December from Southeastern coast of Tamil Nadu. With the migration
of Sun towards the south, a high pressure centre
begins to build up over the landmass and there is
a gradual weakening and withdrawal of
monsoon. The retreating monsoon causes rain in
the coastal tracts to the south of Krishna delta and
the interior of the southern districts.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climatic Regions of India</i></strong></div>

The climatic division of India is based upon
Trewartha’s scheme, which is a modified form of
Koppen’s system and it corresponds with the
vegetative, agricultural and geographical regions
of India. Main climatic regions of India include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tropical Rain Forest (Am): It is found on
the West coastal plain, the Western Ghats and
some parts of Assam. It is characterized by high
temperature in winter not below 18.2°C; and in
summer about 29°C. The average rainfall exceeds
200 cm.</li>
        <li>Tropical Savanna (Aw): It is located in
peninsular region except the semi - arid zone in
the leeside of the Sahyadris. It is characterized by
long dry weather throughout winter and early
summer and high temperature (above 18.2°C).
Annual rainfall varies from 76 cm in the west to
150 cm. in the east.</li>
        <li>Tropical Semi-arid Steppe (BS): Prevails
in the rain-shadow belt running southward from
Central Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu in the leeside
of the Sahyadris and Cardamom Hills. It is
characterized by low rainfall which varies from 38
cm to 80 cm, high temperature between 20°- 30° C.</li>
        <li>Tropical and Sub-Tropical Steppe (BSh):
Occurs over Punjab extending to Kutch region.
The Thar Desert is in the west and the more
humid climate of the Ganga plain and the
Peninsula to its East and South respectively.</li>
        <li>Tropical Desert (BWh): The area includes
the western parts of Barmer, Jaisalmer and
Bikaner district of Rajasthan. A large portion of
Kutch Peninsula along with Thar Desert is also
included. It is characterized by scanty rainfall (30
cm. average) with few parts receiving 12 cm
annual rainfall. Temperature is above 35° C.</li>
        <li>Humid Sub-tropical with Dry Winter
(Cwa): The area includes South of the Himalayas,
East of the tropical and sub - tropical steppe and
north of tropical Savanna. It is characterized by
rainfall of 63.5 cm to 254 cm most of which is
received during the South West Monsoon season.</li>
        <li>Mountain Climate (H): The area lies
above 6000 metre sea-level. Examples are the
Himalayan and Karakoram ranges. Temperature
decreases with altitude. The Trans - Himalayan
region particularly Ladakh has a dry and cold
climate - what may be called cold desert. Drought
is permanent.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Variability in the rainfall</i></strong></div>

The average annual rainfall in India is 100cm.
However, this rainfall is neither uniformly
distributed throughout the country nor certain to
occur every year. The unpredictable nature of the
annual rain poses a major problem for India. But,
there are certain regions of heavy rainfall in India
which are almost certain to get the annual rainfall
of more than 200 cm every year. These are Assam
and its neigh bourhood, the Western Ghats and
the adjoining coastal areas and foothills of the
Himalayas. In contrast, certain areas, particularly
western Rajasthan, Kutch, Ladakh Plateau are
perpetually drought - prone, the average annual
precipitation being about 100 cm.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Points to remember</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The position of mountain ranges and the
direction of the rain bearing winds are the
two main factors that determine the climate
of India.</li>
        <li>The chief characteristic of India’s climate is
the alternating seasons.</li>
        <li>“Growing Season” is that part of the year
when the growth of vegetation is made
possible by the favourable combination of
temperature and rainfall. The length of the
growing season is determined by the
number of frost free days.</li>
        <li>The “North - East Trade Wind” blows from
the continents to ocean.</li>
        <li>In March, the highest day temperature of
about 380 C occurs in Deccan Plateau.</li>
        <li>In March, Rajasthan has very high
temperature of “450
C”.</li>
        <li>In Kerala and Western coastal land, the premonsoon showers are known as “mango -
shower”</li>
        <li>“Kalbaishakhi”, which is accompanied by
thunderstorm, strong wind and heavy
rainfall, occurs in Assam and West Bengal.</li>
        <li>“Loo” refers to hot, dry wind that blows in
northern plains. It is very common in
Haryana, U.P, Punjab and Bihar.</li>
        <li>During SW monsoon, the bulk of the rainfall
is received in every part of India except
Tamilnadu.</li>
        <li>It is the relief of the region which determines
the amount of rainfall in any region.</li>
        <li>The “South - East Trade Wind” from the
southern hemisphere are drawn into India
as the south - west monsoon winds which
after they cross the equator.</li>
    </ul>
