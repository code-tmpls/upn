<h3>Soils of India</h3>


Soils in India display wide diversity because
of the variations in the climate and relief. The soilforming components which include parent
material, relief, climate and natural vegetation
vary spatially. The soil can be classified under
various criteria, most acceptable being based on
horizon development and its relationship with
climatic condition.
<br>
<br>
The factors that affect the soil formation are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Parent Material:</b> The parent material, of
which the soils are formed, is derived from the
weathering of the rocks exposed on surface. For
example the soil derived from lava and rocks is
generally black in colour.</li>
        <li><b>Relief Features:</b> They influence the process
of soil formation through various ways. The
variation in relief features like slope,
underground water etc. affect the colour,
composition and properties of soil.</li>
        <li><b>Climate:</b> Climate is the most important
single factor in soil formation. It affects the
conditions of soil formation through the amount
and seasonal distribution of temperature and
rainfall. It also affects soil formation indirectly by
affecting other genetic factors like parent material,
relief features, natural vegetation etc.</li>
        <li><b>Natural Vegetation:</b> The decayed leaf
material adds to the fertility of soil by providing
to it the much needed content of humus. That is
why the densely forested areas contain some of
the best soils.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Soil Types</i></strong></div>

The Indian Council of Agricultural Research
(ICAR) has divided the Soils of India into 8 major
groups.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Alluvial Soils including the coastal and
deltaic alluvium:</b> Agriculturally the most
important soil. It covers 24% of the country’s total
area. Mainly found in Central plains extending
from Punjab to Assam, Eastern and Western
Coastal plains and deltaic region. Alluvial soil is
transported or inter-zonal soil. It is divided into
Khadar (newer) and Bhabar (older). This soil is,
however, deficient in nitrogen and humus
content; unsuitable for water retentive plantation
e.g. cotton. It is suitable for the cultivation of rice,
wheat, sugar cane and vegetables.
<br>
<br>
<b>Khadar:</b> Finer and newer alluvium. Its texture
varies from clayey to sandy loam. It is light in
colour and is formed in the flood-plains of rivers
and is generally acidic, deficient in lime,
phosphorus and humus.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kankar:</b> They are found only few feets below
the surface of Bhangar which is a bed of lime
nodules known as kankar. Kankars are collected
near Dadri in Haryana for making cement.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bhangar:</b> They are older alluvium or coarse
gravel, high level soils above 30 m above flood
level where flood water cannot reach. Its texture
is more clayey and the colour is darker.
Alluvial texture varies from sand and loam
to silts and heavy clays that are ill drained and
sometimes injurious accumulations of salt and
produces a sterile surface called “Usar”.
In the sub-mountain belts on the foot hills of
Siwalik alluvial forms with coarse often pebbly
soils known as “Bhabhar”. To its south occurs
swampy lowland with silty soils known as
“Terai”.</li>
        <li>Black Cotton Soils: This is also called regur
soil. Main areas include Deccan Trap,
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh,
Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, U.P.
and Rajasthan. Black Soils are usually deficient
in nitrogen, phosphate and humus but rich in
Potash, lime, aluminum, calcium and magnesium.
The soil is moisture retentive and it has a high
degree of fertility. It is suitable for the cultivation
of cotton, cereals, oilseeds, tobacco, groundnut
and citrus fruits.
<br>
<br>
Black soils develop under semi-arid
condition, in area covered with basalt. Colour of
the black soils varies from deep black to light
black or chestnut. The black colour is added due
to the presence of “Titaniferous magnetite”.
They become sticky when wet due to high
percentage of clay and develop cracks in hotsunny weather. Black soils are well known for
their fertility. Since, the content of water soluble
salt is high they are not suitable for heavy
irrigation. Black soil regions are ideal for dry
forming due to their moisture retentive quality.</li>
        <li><b>Red Soils:</b> Occupies about 70% of the total
area in Tamil Nadu, Chhotanagpur, few parts of
Andhra Pradesh and Orissa.
<br>
<br>
Red soils develop generally on crystalline and
metamorphic rocks rich in ferromagnesium
minerals. Hence they are more sandy and less
clayey. Red soils are found in area of
comparatively low rainfall and so are less leached
than the laterite soils. Red soils have a
concentration of iron, absence of lime, Kankar,
carbonates, humus, phosphoric acid and are
neutral to acid reactions.
<br>
<br>
They are not retentive to moisture so
cultivated mostly during the rainy season. These
are favourable for the cultivation of pulses and
coarse grains.
<br>
<br>
<b>Crops:</b> Rice, Ragi, Tobacco, Vegetables,
Groundnut etc. on coarse soil for higher level;
Sugarcane on heavy clay at lower level.</li>
        <li>Laterite Soils: They are formed under the
conditions of high rainfall and temperature with
alternate wet and dry periods. These soils are rich
in oxides of iron and aluminum but poor in
nitrogen, potash, phosphoric acid and lime
content due to leaching; highly acidic in nature.
These soils are concentrated in Vindhyan Plateau,
Satpura, Mahadeo and Maikal ranges in Madhya
Pradesh, Malabar Coast, Orissa coast and
Meghalaya.
<br>
<br>
Laterite soils develop in the tropical regions
which receive heavy seasonal rainfall. Heavy
rainfall promotes leaching whereby lime and
silica are leached away and soils rich in oxides of
iron and aluminum are left behind. If the oxide
of aluminum predominates the laterite soils, they
are called “Bauxite”, the chief industrial ore of
aluminum.
<br>
<br>
Laterite soils are red due to the presence of
oxides of iron. They are poor in lime content hence
acidic in nature. Laterite soils of high areas are
very poor and least retentive to moisture.
Sometimes they form the barren land topography.
Laterite soils of low level areas hinder the process
of laterization due to regular addition of soil
washed down from the neighbouring high areas.
Crops: Rice, Ragi, Sugarcane, Tapioca,
Chestnut etc.</li>
        <li><b>Forest Soils:</b> Humus predominates in forest
soil but it is deficient in potash, phosphorous and
lime. It is distributed over the Himalayan and
other ranges in the north, Western Ghats, Eastern
Ghats and Peninsula. Favourable for plantation
crops e.g. tea, coffee spices and tropical fruits.</li>
        <li><b>Podzols (At high Level):</b> They are formed
under high acidic condition and found on
higher slopes of Himachal Pradesh and
Jammu & Kashmir. They are covered by
coniferous forests. They are highly leached
due to excessive moisture and are greyish
brown in colour.</li>
        <li><b>Brown Forest Soil (In warm temperate belt):</b>
They are less acidic than podzol with high
base status. They are rich in humus and
fertile and extensively used for crop
cultivation.</li>
        <li><b>Alpine Meadow (In alpine zone of
Himalayas):</b> They are dark coloured, either
sandy-clay or sandy-loam. They contain
mostly undecomposed plants.</li>
        <li><b>Arid and Desert Soils:</b> These soils,
characterized by high salt and low humus
content, are found in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab,
Rann of Kutch, and other rain-shadow regions,
since these soils consist of high phosphate,
fertility increases with irrigation and by adding
nutrients.
<br>
<br>
Desert soils are found in an arid and semiarid conditions in north-western part of India,
west of Aravalli range. They are mostly friable
and low in moisture content. They are rich in
phosphate but poor in nitrogen and clay content
(only 8%).
<br>
<b>Crops:</b> Very few crops especially Millets,
Jowar, Bajra are grown for want of water supply.</li>
        <li><b>Saline and Alkali Soils:</b> Develop along arid
region in small patches. Also called Reh, Kallar
and Usar, they are infertile but can be reclaimed
by good drainage. These soils are found in
Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, U.P. and Bihar.
Saline and alkaline soils develop at places
where desert condition prevails because of high
rate of evaporation and very little leaching. Saline
soils contain free sodium and other salts while
alkaline soils have sodium chloride. Alkaline soils
are deficient in calcium and nitrogen and are
highly impervious and have very low water
holding capacity.
<br>
<b>Crops:</b> Rice, wheat, cotton, sugarcane, tobacco
etc. supported by irrigation. For better fertility
application of lime and gypsum and cultivation
of salt resistant crops like berseem, rice, sugarcane
can be used.</li>
        <li><b>Peaty and Organic Soils:</b> Develop under
result of accumulation of large quantity of organic
matter. Highly saline and deficient in phosphate
and potash and occur in central Orissa, Central
Bihar, West Bengal and Tamil Nadu.
Peaty and Marshy soils originate in humid
regions as a result of an accumulation of large
amount of organic matters. They may contain
considerable soluble salt and is called as “Kari”.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These areas are submerged under water
during the monsoon season and as soon as rain
ceases the land is put under paddy cultivation.
These soils are black, heavy and highly acidic.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Soil Erosion</i></strong></div>

The destruction of soil cover is known as soil
erosion. The main reasons of soil erosion are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Deforestation</li>
        <li>Over-grazing</li>
        <li>Irrational cultivation (e.g., Jhoom
cultivation in North Eastern India)</li>
        <li>Floods</li>
        <li>Winds</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Soil Erosion in India:</b> The areas which have
suffered soil erosion in India are generally tracts
having sparse vegetation cover like the badlands
of lower Chambal and the Yamuna. The
vegetation cover in these areas is sparse; hence,
the running water cuts easily into the soil forming
deep ravines. In many parts of the plain a high
degree of slope induces similar erosion. The dry
areas of Rajasthan and Haryana, on the other
hand, lose their soil cover through wind erosion.
Soil Conservation: Soil conservation depends
on the existing conditions. The most common
methods, however, include afforestation, contour
cultivation and scientific methods of cultivation
keeping in view landform characteristics.
Rain water washes the calcium compounds
and consequently it causes the lime deficiency in
soils. Such soils are acidic and develop in area of
heavy rainfall. Oxygen combining with iron
compounds produces Iron-Oxide, red in colour
and it gives the red colour to the soils.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Points to remember</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Chemical weathering is more important in
hot tropical climate. Hence, the Indian
subcontinent is prone to chemical weathering.</li>
        <li>Leaching is more important in area of heavy
rainfall. It is the most common feature of
hilly regions.</li>
        <li>High temperature of India promotes active
decay of vegetation and hence humus is
destroyed. So, Indian soils are generally
deficient in humus and require regular
application of nitrogen rich fertilizer.</li>
        <li>Titanium salt adds black colour to the soils
of Indian Plateau.</li>
        <li>Sedentary soil / in situ soil, produced after
breaking of parent rocks underneath the
surface, are usually very deep up to 15mt.
or more on the Deccan Plateau.</li>
        <li>Sedentary soils are: Black cotton soils,
Laterite Red soil, Podzolic soil of forest,
Saline and Alkaline soil, Peaty soil.</li>
        <li>Drifted soils / Transported soils / Azonal
soils are formed in situ but transported by
agents and deposited in valleys and deltas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
