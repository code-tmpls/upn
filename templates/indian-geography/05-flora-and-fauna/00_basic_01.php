<h3>Flora And Fauna</h3>


Owing to a wide range of climatic condition,
India can boast of a rich and varied vegetation.
In the remote hilly tracts of the Himalayas and
Deccan mountains, a large number of endemic
flora i.e. Plants that have grown there for millions
of years and are not found to grow naturally
elsewhere in the world, is found here.
In recent years, many of these endemic plants
are facing extinction because of ecological
disturbance. There are eight floristic regions of
India:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Western Himalayas</li>
        <li>The Eastern Himalayas</li>
        <li>Assam</li>
        <li>The Indus plain</li>
        <li>The Ganga plain</li>
        <li>Deccan</li>
        <li>Malabar</li>
        <li>Andamans</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

India has the forest cover of 22 per cent while
the actual forest cover is only about 11 per cent of
the total country area. Coniferous forest cover
only 6 per cent and the broadleaf deciduous
forests comprise about 94 per cent of the total
forest cover.
<br>
<br>
<b>Forest as % of total area of the state:</b>
Andaman & Nicobar Islands (73%) >Arunachal
Pradesh (62%)> Manipur (61%)>Mizoram (57%)>
Meghalaya (55.4%)> Tripura (49.5%)> Nagaland

Chhattisgarh (35%)> Goa (20%)>Andhra Pradesh

Karnataka (14%)> Tamil Nadu (13%)> Uttar
Pradesh including Uttarakhand (12%)>
Maharashtra (11.8%)> W. Bengal (8.8%)> Jammu
and Kashmir (65%)> Rajasthan (4.1%).
India has a great variety of fauna, with about
500 species of mammals and 2,100 species of birds
and reptiles. Some rare and extinctive species are
found in certain pockets in India important
among them are the Asiatic lion, now confined
to the Gir forest; the one horned rhinoceros, a
vanishing species in Assam and the great Indian
bustards, now rarely seen in Rajasthan.
<br>
<br>
Some plant and animal species are protected
under various schemes and a number of wildlife
sanctuaries have been planned for the
conservation of animal species. The National
wildlife action plan was adopted in 1983. It
provides the framework of strategy as well as
program for wild life conservation. The wildlife
& reserves in India can be classified into ‘National
Parks’ and ‘Wildlife Sanctuaries. The National
parks protect the entire ecosystem, where as
wildlife sanctuaries have the special purpose of
preserving animals and birds. There are, at
present, 68 national parks including marine parks,
high altitude parks and parks in protected areas
of Andaman and Nicobar and 367 wild life
sanctuaries.
<br>
<br>
The Red Panda project was started in 1996 in
the Padmja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park.
The Manipur Bow Antler deer project was started
in 1977 in Kaibul Lamjoa in Manipur near the
Loktak Lake. The Gir Lion sanctuary project was
launched by the Gujarat government in the Gir
wildlife sanctuary in 1972. The Himalayan musk
deer project was started in the Kedarnath
sanctuary in Uttarakhand. The crocodile project
was started in 1975 in Orissa. Later Uttar Pradesh,
Rajasthan, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Andhra
Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar,
Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Nagaland
were included in this project. Project Hangul was
started in 1970 in the Dachigam national park in
Kashmir.
<br>
<br>
The national bird of India, the peacock, is
found along with many species of birds
throughout India. The only ape found in India is
the Hoolock Gabon in Assam.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Points to Remember</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Wild Life Protection Act - 1972 adopted
by all states except Jammu and Kashmir and
India is signatory to the convention on
International Trade in endangered Species
of Wild Flora and Fauna under which the
commercial exploitation of the species is
prohibited.</li>
        <li>India posses about 8% of the world’s known
living organism while it has only 2 percent
of the world’s land mass.</li>
        <li>At present about 15,000 plant species and
75,000 animal species are facing extinction.</li>
        <li>In the state of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh
and Andhra Pradesh, the elephant has
almost all disappeared.</li>
        <li>The North-east India has over 600 different
orchid species which are now facing extinction.</li>
        <li>The idea of biosphere reserves was initiated
by UNESCO in 1973-74 and the first reserve
in the Nilgiri was established in 1986.</li>
        <li>The “Man and Biosphere” (MAB)
programme was launched by the
government of India for the conservation of
the biological diversity.</li>
        <li>Asiatic lion, one of the rarest and most
important wild animals in India is found in
only two ports of the country: the famous
Gir National Park in Gujarat and the
Chandraprabha wildlife sanctuary of
Uttar Pradesh.</li>
        <li>The one horned rhinoceros is also vanishing
but now it is found in Assam’s Kaziranga
National Park and Manas wildlife sanctuary.</li>
        <li>The Dachigam National Park of Kashmir
protects the hangul or Kashmir Stag.</li>
        <li>The largest areas reserved for sanctuaries
are in Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh,
Gujarat and Karnataka, but the proportion
of sanctuary area to forest area is highest in
Gujarat.</li>
        <li>The word “National Park” refers to relatively
large area of one or more ecosystem that
has not materially altered by human
exploitation and occupation. The place is
especially meant for plants, animals and
habitats for special scientific education.</li>
        <li>The concept of “Wildlife-Sanctuary” is more
or less similar to the national park but it is
chiefly meant to protect wildlife and
conserve species. Its boundary is not fixed
by the legislation.</li>
        <li>The concept of “Biosphere Reserves” refers
to the multipurpose protected area to
preserve the genetic diversity of the
ecosystem. Its main objectives are; to
conserve integrity and diversity of plants,
animals and micro-organism, to provide
facilities for education, awareness and
training and to promote research on
ecological conservation.</li>
        <li>The “Operation Tiger” was launched by
WWF in 1973 to protect the tiger from
further extinction.</li>
        <li>Of the total 27 tiger reserves in India,
Nagarjunasagar Tiger reserve of Andhra
Pradesh is the largest with an area of
3,568 sq km.</li>
        <li>The National wildlife Action plan was
adopted in 1983.</li>
