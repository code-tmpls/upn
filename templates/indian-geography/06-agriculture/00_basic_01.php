<h3>Agriculture</h3>


Indian agriculture provides livelihood to
about 70% of the work-force, contributes nearly
35% of net national product and accounts for
sizeable share of total value of country’s exports.
It also supplies bulk of wage goods required by
non - agricultural sector and raw material for a
large section of industry.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cropping Season in India</i></strong></div>

India has many growing seasons due to
prevalence of high temperature through a long
period. Different crop seasons are:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Kharif:</b> Crops are sown at the beginning
of the South -West monsoon and harvested at the
end of the South -West monsoon.
Important crops: Jowar, bajra, rice, maize,
cotton, Jute, groundnut, sugarcane, tobacco etc.</li>
            <li><b>Rabi:</b> Crops need relatively cool climate
during the period of growth but warm climate
during the germination of their seed and
maturation.
<br>
Sowing season- (October -December) and
harvesting season (February - April).
Important Crops: Wheat, barley, gram,
linseed, mustard, masur, peas and potatoes.</li>
            <li><b>Zaid:</b> Crops which are being raised
throughout the year due to artificial irrigation.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Zaid Kharif:</b> Sown in August-September
and harvested in December-January. Important
crops include rice, jowar, rapeseed, cotton and
oilseeds.</li>
        <li><b>Zaid Rabi:</b> Sown in February - March and
harvested in April -May. Important crops are
watermelon, cucumber, leafy and other
vegetables.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

Total geographical area of India: 328.7 m. ha.
Total New sown Area: 140.27 m. ha. (46.12%)
Total Net Irrigated Area: 38.80 m. ha (27.66%
of net sown area).
In Eastern India, east of 80° East meridian and
in the coastal lowland (West coastal lowland
south of Surat) rice is the dominant crop. Tea and
jute are distinctive crops of eastern India. West
of 80° East meridian and north of Surat, wheat is
the dominant crop. 100 cm Isohyet is the major
dividing line.
<br>
<br>
Jowar, bajra, pulse, groundnut and cotton are
the chief crops in the Indian Plateau and wheat,
various pulses, cotton, mustard, jowar, bajra, etc.
in the alluvial plains of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana
and Punjab.
