<h3>Irrigation</h3>


The process of supplying water to the crops
by artificial means such as canals, wells, tubewells 
from the source of water such as river, tanks,
ponds or ground water is called irrigation. The
monsoon rainfall in India is uncertain & highly
variable. The temporal & spatial variability of
rainfall accentuates the need for artificial supply
of water to the crops. Hence irrigation in India
becomes indispensable.
<br>
<br>
Apart from vagaries of monsoon, the cropping pattern in 
India also enhances the need for irrigation in the areas with sufficient rainfall.
Certain crops like rice, sugarcane, jute, cotton,
chalks require irrigational water. It is estimated
that production of irrigation crops is 50 to 100
percent higher than that of unirrigated crops
under similar geographical conditions. Introduction of HYV seeds and green revolution have
further increased the need for irrigation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reasons for Water Scarcity</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The rainfall is highly variable.</li>
        <li>18% of water available is polluted and unfit
for drinking.</li>
        <li>Almost all parts of India are affected either
by flood or drought.</li>
        <li>Demand for water is increasing due to rapid
increase in population.</li>
        <li>The management of available water resources in not proper.</li>
        <li>The storage facilities are very poor.</li>
        <li>Over-exploitation of ground water of- ten
result in the intrusion of saline sea water in
coastal areas.</li>
        <li>Cultivation of hybrid varieties of paddy,
wheat, cotton, sugarcane and tobacco which
consume more water.</li>
        <li>Evaporation loss of water stored in large
reservoirs and loss by seepage in long canal
systems.</li>
        <li>Siltation of water bodies.</li>
        <li>Dumping of various types of pollutants into
water bodies reduce its usability.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

 The source of irrigation depends upon the
water availability, topography, relief,
availability of soil and moisture,
requirements of crop. Important sources of
irrigation in India include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Wells:</b> Wells are the most basic sources of
irrigation in India. It depends upon the availability of ground 
water. The Great Plains, the deltaic regions of the Mahanadi, Godavari,
Krishna and Cauvery are important regions
of well irrigation.</li>
        <li><b>Tanks:</b> Located in the rocky region of the
Peninsula. The tanks are non - perennial in
nature and additional water is needed in
summer. About 11% of the net irrigated area
in India is under tank irrigation. The
Karnataka plateau, coastal Maharashtra,
Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu have this kind
of irrigation.</li>
        <li><b>Canals:</b> India has one of the world’s largest
areas under canal irrigation. About 40% of
the net irrigated area comes under canal
irrigation. Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana,
Rajasthan, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh are the
main regions.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Multi-purpose projects aim at:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Flood Control</li>
        <li>Promotion and operation of irrigation
schemes, water supply.</li>
        <li>Generation and Transmission of electric power</li>
        <li>Promotion and control of irrigation</li>
        <li>Afforestation and other economic activity generation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

For the better utilization of the total potential
the irrigation schemes have been divided into :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Major Projects: Cultivable command area
of more than 10,000 hectare, (including
canal irrigation)</li>
        <li>Medium Project: Cultivable command area
between 2000 and 10000 hectare.</li>
        <li>Minor Projects: Cultivable command area
less than 2000 hectare, include mainly wellirrigation.</li>
        <li>Micro Projects: Drip irrigation and the use
of sprinklers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In Punjab 75% of the net sown area is irrigated,
in Haryana & U.P. this ratio is of about 57%, in
TN. About 49% in U.P. about 38%, in Maharashtra
only 9% are irrigated.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>POINTS TO REMEMBER</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Wells provide about 45 percent irrigation to
the net irrigated area in India.</li>
        <li>Tank Irrigation is chiefly confined to west
Bengal, Bihar and Orissa and it accounts for
about 10 percent of the net irrigated area.</li>
        <li>The “Canal Irrigation” is chiefly practised
in U.P., Punjab, Haryana and Andhra
Pradesh and it accounts for about 40 percent of the net irrigated area.</li>
        <li>The Nuclear Power Stations are located at
Tarapur (Maharashtra) Kota (Rajasthan),
Narora (U.P), Kalpakkam (Tamil Nadu),
Kakrapara (Gujarat) and Kaiga (Karnataka).</li>
        <li>About 91.5 percent of the surface wa t e r
flows into sea, 37% of the ground water
resources is utilized and 84% of water is used
for irrigation in India.</li>
        <li>About 38 percent of the net sown area is
under irrigation in India; in Mizoram it is
only 7.3 percent while in Punjab it is 90.8
percent.</li>
        <li>The areas adjacent to Krishna- Godavari
delta and Cauvery delta such as Punjab,
Haryana and Western U.P. have more than
60 percent of the areas under irrigation.</li>
        <li>The wells and tube wells irrigation predominates in Gujarat where 78.4 percent of the
net irrigated areas fall under it.</li>
        <li>According to the Water Treaties noriver
valley projects falls within the jurisdiction
of a single state.</li>
        <li>The “Farakka Accord” was concluded in
1996. It cemented the controversy between
India and Bangladesh which arose with the
building of Farakka dam on river Ganga in
near Calcutta.</li>
        <li>The “Mahakali River Treaty” between Nepal
and India was concluded in June 1997 which
concluded rivers like Mahakali Sarda barrage, Tanakpur barrage and Pancheswar
Projects.</li>
        <li>According to the Indus Water Treaty 80% of
the water of Indus system is made available
to Pakistan and remaining 20 percent to
India.</li>
        <li>The Damodar Valley Project in India is based
on the Tennessee Valley Authority of U.S.A.
With the construction of four dams as
Maithan, Konar, Tilaiya and Panchet the
“river of sorrow” has turned into “rivers of
plenty”.</li>
        <li>The “Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar Lake” on
the Rihand dam is the largest artificial reservoir in Asia.</li>
        <li>The Narmada Valley Project or the Sardar
Sarovar Project is one of the largest projects
under implementation anywhere in the world.</li>
        <li>The “National Water Grid” envisages
interlinking the various rivers to utilize their
surplus water by diverting it to deficit area.
The plan consists of to join Ganga to Kaveri
and Brahmaputra to Ganga through canals.
Through canal, Narmada will be turned
towards Gujarat and Rajasthan.</li>
        <li>The “Watershed area” refers to the
geohydrological area that drains at a common point.</li>
