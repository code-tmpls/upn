<h3>Animal Husbandary & Fisheries</h3>


India has the largest and most varied animal
resources in the world and it has about 1/6th of the
cattle, 1/2 of the buffalo and 1/5th of the goat population in the World. India has a good number of
milch breeds. Sahiwal, Red Singhi and Deoni are
some of the outstanding breeds. India has gone for
the world’s largest and most ambitious milk
programmes called ‘operation flood’. Drought
breeds are poor in milk yields, but the bullocks are
excellent draught animals. About 42% of the cattle
in the country are draught animals.
<br>
<br>
India has 3% of the world’s sheep population
and ranks 6th among the sheep-breeding countries
of the world. Rajasthan has the largest (24%) of
India’s total stock. India owns one of the largest
livestock populations in the world. It accounts for
16% of the cattle population and 57% of buffalo
population. India has become the largest producer
of milk in the world.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Milch Breeds</i></strong></div>    
        
Gir, Sindhi, Red Sindhi, Sahiwal, Tharpakar
and Deoni are some of the outstanding breeds of
milch cattle. The Gir is a native of Saurashtra and
is now found in several parts of Gujarat and adjoining Rajasthan. The Sindhi breeds are mainly
raised in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra although it can be raised in several other part of
the country due to its disease resistant quality.
The Red Sindhi breeds have a distinct red colour
and hails from Sind in Pakistan. The Sahiwal
breed has its origin in widely found in Punjab,
Haryana, Rajasthan, UP and Delhi. The Deoni
breed is widely in north western and western
parts of Andhra Pradesh.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Drought Breeds</i></strong></div>    
        
Among the important drought breeds are included the Nagori Bauchaur, Malvi, Kherigarh,
Hallikar, Khilari, Amritmahal, Kanhayam, Ponwar,
Bargur and Siri. The Bagori breed is a native of Jodhpur and is found in large 
parts of Rajasthan, Haryana, U.P. and M.P, the Bauchaur breed is
mainly found in Bihar. The Malvi is largely concentrated in the dry western 
parts of M.P. The Kenkatha or Kenwariya breed hails from Banda district of U.P.
and neigh- bouring areas of M.P. Kheri district of
U.P. is the habitat of Kherigarp breed. The Halikar

Hassan and Mysore districts of Karnataka but are
spread all over the Peninsular India. Sholapur and
Satara districts comprise the home of the Khillari
breed. The Bargur and the Kangayam breeds are
the natives of Coimbatore district of Tamil Nadu.
The Siri grows well in the hilly of Darjeeling and
Sikkim.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Exotic Breeds</i></strong></div>    
        
Some of the high milk-yielding exotic breeds
have been developed in India. Some foreign
breeds have been crossed with India breeds and
new breeds called cross breed have been developed. Some of the important exotic breeds are
Jersey, Holstein, Friesian, Swiss-Brown, German
Feleckvich and Ayrshire.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Buffalo</i></strong></div>    
        
About 75% of buffaloes are reared for milk.
In wet region of W. Bengal, Assam, Orissa, Kerala
they are also used for drafting and ploughing in
the fields. In addition to the fact that India more
buffaloes than any other country of the world,
the Indian buffalo breeds are some of the world’s
best breeds. The Murrah, Bhadwari, Jaffarabadi,
Surti, Mehsana, Nagpuri and Nili Ravi are among
the important breeds.</li>

In terms of cows and oxen population M.P.
(including Chhattisgarh) ranks first followed by
Uttar Pradesh (including Uttaranchal), Bihar (including Jharkhand), 
West Bengal. In terms of cow
milk production Uttar Pradesh (including
Uttaranchal) ranks first followed by west Bengal,
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sheep</i></strong></div>    
        
India stands sixth in sheep population in the
world after Australia, Russia, China, Argentina
and New Zealand. More than 4 per cent of the
world’s sheep are reared in India, most of the
sheep are raised in regions which are too dry, too
stony or too mountainous to be too good for agricultural or 
for cattle rearing. Most of the India
sheep are of poor quality yielding inferior wool
in less quantity. Their yield of mutton is also very
low. However, some of the good breeds are found
in the northern temperate region. By virtue of
their sheer number, sheep occupy an important
place in our economy because they provide us
with wool, mutton and skins.
<br>
<br>
The distribution of sheep may be properly
studied by dividing the sheep areas into following regions:
Temperate Himalayan Region: It comprises
Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and
Uttarakhand. The entire region has temperate climate which is quite 
suit- able for good quality sheep. The excellent pastures exist on the hill
slopes. India’s best quality sheep are reared in the
Kula, Kangra, Chamba and Kashmir valley at altitudes varying from 2000 to 3000 m.
Dry North-Western Region: This region includes Rajasthan and neighbouring parts of
Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat
and Madhya Pradesh. There are more than 13
million sheep contributing to about half of the
total wool production of India, however the wool
is of comparatively inferior quality and the yield
of wool per sheep is lower than that of the Himalayan. Marwari breed of 
Rajasthan is famous for its wool.
<br>
<br>
<b>Semi-arid Southern Region:</b> This region,
com- prising Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and parts of Madhya
Pradesh, supports half the total number of sheep
found in India. In spite of the largest numbers of
ships about 50 percent of the sheep of this region
are raised for mutton and produce no wool.
Humid Eastern Region: This region comprising Bihar, West Bengal, Assam and Orissa, has
humid climate which is not favourable for sheep
rearing. The sheep are mainly reared for producing mutton. In terms of sheep population
Rajasthan ranks first followed by Andhra
Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Goat</i></strong></div>    
        
Goat is called the poor man’s cow because it
can be cheaply reared on meagre grass of poor
quality. It is the major supplier of mutton along
with milk, hair and skins. Goats are found in larger
number as compared to sheep and are next only
to cattle. About one-sixth of the world’s goat is
reared in India. Although goats are found in almost of 
parts of country their major concentration
is in Bihar (17.31 mil- lion), West Bengal (14.17
million), and Uttar Pradesh (13.11 million). These
states account for more than half goats of India.
There are some outstanding breeds which are
found in some specific areas. The Himalaya or
Angora goat which is also known as the Chamba,
Gaddi, Chegu or Kashmiri breed is reared in
Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. It produces soft
warm hair. The Pashmina reared in Kashmir and
Kullu valley is world renowned for its pashmina
fur known as Mohair.
<br>
<br>
The Jamunapuri is the breed found between the
rivers Yamuna and the Chambal. It is dual purpose
breed providing meat and milk. Among the other
breeds are the Beetal of Punjab, of the Marwari,
Mehsana, Kathiawar and Zalwadi of Rajasthan
Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh and the Barari, Surti
and Deccani of the Peninsular India. Several important foreign 
breeds such as Alpine, Nubian, Saanen,
Toggenberg and Angora have been used for cross
breeding with the local breeds.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pigs</i></strong></div>
            
There are about 100 lakh pigs providing about
5 per cent of India’s meat production in the form
of pork. In a poor and thickly populated country
like India, pig rearing is an important activity
because pig provides rich meat at low cost. Pig
farming plays in important role in improving the
socio-economic status of sizeable section of
weaker rural communities especially in northeastern 
states where every rural family rears pigs
for meat.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Horses and Ponies</i></strong></div>    
        
 About one fourth of the total horses and ponies are found Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jammu
and Kashmir. Some of the important indigenous
breeds include Marwari, Kathiawari, Manipuri,
Bhutani, Spiti and Chummarti.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Donkey and Mules</i></strong></div>    
        
Donkey and mules are used as beasts of Burden, especially in those areas where modern
modes of transportation cannot be used. Most of
the donkeys are found in Rajasthan, Uttar
Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Mules
are derived from the crossbreeding of mares and
donkeys. The largest concentration of mules is
found in Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.
In terms of goat population Bihar (including
Jharkhand) ranks first followed by Rajasthan,
West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh (including
Uttaranchal).
<br>
<br>
In terms of goat milk production Uttar
Pradesh (including Uttaranchal) ranks first followed by Rajasthan, 
Bihar (including Jharkhand) and former M.P.
In terms of Hen and Duck population Andhra
Pradesh ranks first followed by West Bengal,
Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu.
In terms of total milk production Uttar
Pradesh (including Uttaranchal) ranks first followed by Rajasthan, 
Bihar (including Jharkhand) and Madhya Pradesh (including Chhattisgarh).
In terms of wool production Rajasthan ranks
first followed by Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka
and Gujarat.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Camels</i></strong></div>    
        
Camel is an extremely useful animal for
drought and transport purposes in the arid lands
and is called the ship of the desert. About twothirds of camels 
are concen- trated in Rajasthan alone. The rest of the camels are found in the arid
semiarid areas of Punjab, Haryana and Gujarat.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fisheries</i></strong></div>    

India is the world’s 7th largest producers of
fish. Production of fish in India is small, being
only about 2.4% of the total world production.
72% of the total catch is brought by non - mechanized boats. 
Marine fisheries account for 2/3rd
and inland fisheries for 1/3rd of India’s fish production. 
The present per capita consumption of
fish in India is only 4kgs/year against a desired
consumption level of 31kgs/year.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Marine Fisheries</i></strong></div>

It includes coastal fisheries, off-shore fishers
and deep sea fisheries.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Coastal Fisheries:</b> The coastal zone extends
upto 25m depth. Fish of this belt comprises
of pelagic fishes, like sardines, Mackerel,
Lesser Sardines, bottom species like Bombayduck, silver bellies, Ships, etc.
Herrings, Sardines and Anchovies together
accounts for 65% catch.
<br>
<br>
Tuna, Bonitos, Mackerels, Crustaceans, Shark,
Rays, Skates, Flounders, Halibuts account the
remaining 35% of total catch.
71% of total production of marine fish is along
the west coast of Kerala, Maharashtra,
Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa. Only about 29% of
the total marine fish catch comes from the east
coast of India.</li>
        <li><b>Off-shore and Deep Sea Fisheries:</b> It is not
fully developed in India. Large concentrations
of Sardines and Mackerel have been located
along the Thiruvanantapuram Goa coast.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Inland Fisheries</i></strong></div>    
        
Quick growing species with non-precious
feeding habit are generally selected for cultivation in ponds, lakes and reservoirs.
Some famous inland species are Cirrhinusmarigala, Cirrhinus -cirrhosa, Puntius,
Cornaticus, Katla, Labeo-rohita, etc.
In brackish water estuarine fisheries the fish
found are mostly marine species like Anchovies, Cat-fish, Perches, Pearl-spot, etc.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>West Coast Fishing</i></strong></div>    
        
Here the fishing season is from September to
February-March.
Here both the continental self and the water
have more pronounced seasonal cycle and
higher Phosphatic and nitrate contents, so
more availability of plankton.
Major fish species are Sardines, Mackarel,
Prawn, etc.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>East Coast Fishing</i></strong></div>    
        
Here the fishing season is from July to October on the Andhra coast and September to
April on the Coromandel Coast.
Here the circulation of water is less pronounced.
Estuarine Fisheries: Chilka and Pulicat Lake.
Per capita fish consumption is one of the highest in West Bengal but the state production is
sufficient to meet only 20% of total demand.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pearl Fisheries</i></strong></div>    
        
East coasts are more extensive and productive than the west coast and extended from
Cape-Camorin to Kilkarai with Tuticorin as
centre. Excellent quality of Oriental Pearls or
Lingna pearls is found here.
On the West coasts Gulf of Kutch, to the north
of Halar district of Saurashtra and near
Jamnagar are the productive regions.
The principal pearl fishing areas in India are Gulf
of Mannar, Gulf of Kutch and the Palk Bay.
In southern India pearl-oysters are harvested
by divers but in Kutch and Saurashtra they
are exposed to low-water spring tides and
hence are easily collected by hand.
Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute is
located at Mandapam Camp.</li>
