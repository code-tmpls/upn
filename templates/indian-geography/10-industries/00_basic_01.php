<h3>Industries</h3>


Levels of Industrialization best reflect the
level of eco- nomic development in a country.
Manufacturing is the main process by which
industries convert primary goods into sec- ondary
products by means of value addition, which
involves partial or complete transformation of the
same. The location of industries is an important
theme in geographical studies. It depends on both
geographic and anthropogenic factors.
Geographical Factors: Raw material, Power,
Labour, Transportation, Market, Site, Water
Supply, Climate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Non-Geographical or Anthropogenic</i></strong></div>

<b>Factors:</b> Capital, Policies, Organization, Banking
& Insurance.
<br>
<b>Another Set of Factors:</b> Agglomeration effect,
Industrial inertia.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Textile Industry</i></strong></div>

It includes cotton, jute, wool, silk & synthetic
fibre textiles. Highest employment in
manufacturing sector is found in textile industry
(Cotton, Jute, Wool, Silk).

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cotton Textiles</i></strong></div>
        
It is the most important industry in terms of
employment and production of export goods.
Although Maharashtra and Gujarat are the chief
centres, other important states in this field are
Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh,
Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Tamil Nadu has
the largest number of cotton textile mills in India.

India ranks second after China in the field of
silk production. There are four types f silk:
Mulberry, Tasar, Eri and Muga. All the four Silk
varieties are produced in India. Due to stiff
competition from Italy and Japan the growth of
Industry is very sluggish. India is also the second
largest producer of Tasar after China. India has
also a monopoly in Muga and Assam is the only
producer. The first modern silk factory was
established in 1932 at Howrah.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Iron and Steel Industries</i></strong></div>

Iron & Steel industry is the basis of modern
industri- alization. It is the basic and core industry
upon which many other industries survive. Per
capita consumption of iron & steel is a good
measurement of Industrial development. For the
first time in 1874 pig iron was produced
successfully by Bengal Iron Works. The first
modern iron & steel industry was established
in 1830 at Porto Nova in Tamil Nadu. It proved
to be an abortive attempt. The real beginning
was made in 1907 at Sakchi (Jamshedpur) by
opening the TISCO.

<b>Locational Factors:</b> Since this industry used
heavy, weight loosing & huge quantity of raw
material, the localization is primarily controlled
by the availability of raw materi- als. Therefore,
they are either located near the coalfields or iron
ore mining areas or at the mean distance from
the two. For example, the industries located in
Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal and
Orissa. A new trend of localization near ports
has been set up by the installation of Vijay Nagar
Plant and Vishakhapatnam Plant in A.P. for
export proposes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Aluminium Smelting</i></strong></div>

It is next only to I & S in terms of usefulness
in the modern industries. About 50% of the total
Aluminum in India is consumed in the generation
& distribution of elec- tricity. The other important
requirements are utensils and domestic wares
(20%), transport (12%), Packaging (8%).
<br>
<br>
<b>Locational factors:</b> Production of one tonne
of Aluminum requires 18,573 KWh of electricity.
Thus 40% of the produc- tion cost goes to
Electricity alone. Thus, electricity & occur- rence
of Bauxite determine the location of an Aluminum
Plant. Indian Aluminum Company was started
in 1938 and Aluminum corporation of India in
1937 as a public limited company. Its plant started
functioning in 1942 at Jaykaynagar in West
Bengal. INDAL (Indian Aluminum Company
Limited) set up its plant in Alappuzha (Kerala).
During Second Plan, Hirakud in Orissa &
Renukut in UP were installed by INDAL and
HINDALCO; at Korba by BALCO in 1965 and
also at Ratnagiri.
