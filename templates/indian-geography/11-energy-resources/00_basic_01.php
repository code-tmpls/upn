<h3>Energy Resources</h3>


Energy consumption in a country is a good
indicator of its development. It is said that the
wheel of progress moves fast with the flow of
energy.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COAL</i></strong></div>

It is an inflammable organic substance
composed mainly of hydrocarbons, found in the
form of sedimentary rocks, which could be used
as a fuel to supply heat or light or both.
It constitutes about 60% of total commercial
energy con sumed. The power sector and
industries account for 94% of its total consumption.
It is called black gold for its high utility.
In India the coal bearing strata have been
classified under two main categories:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gondwana Coal Field</i></strong></div>

About 98 % of Indian coal reserves our
confined to Gondwana.
There are more than 74 basins mostly in the
Peninsular India. These basins are in the river
valleys like Damodar, Son, Mahanadi, Brahmani,
Wardha, Godavari, Indravati, Koel, Narmada,
Panch, etc.
Gondwana coal is said to be about 250 million
years old.
<br>
<br>
This coal is both coking as well as non-coking
with low sulphur content. It is bituminous to subbituminous 
types and free of moisture. In general
this coal is good steam or gas coal.
Gondwana coal of Jharia in Jharkhand is the
“store house of metallurgical coal in India”.
This coal bearing “domuda” rocks are also
found along the foothills of Himalayas in eastern
and north-eastern part and in north Bengal.</li>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tertiary Coalfields</i></strong></div>

It is associated with marine deposits to
limestones, which were formed during Lower and
Middle Eocene, about 15 to 60 million years ago.
It is primary confined to extra-peninsular
India. They occurs in part of Assam, Meghalaya,
Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Darjeeling,
Pondicherry, Kerala, Tamil, Nadu, Kashmir, U.P.
and Rajasthan.
All tertiary coal generally have high sulphur
percentage.</li>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lignite Coal Reserves</i></strong></div>

J&K: Kashmir valley
Tamil Nadu: Neyveli, Karaikudi, Kulattur.
Rajasthan: Raithan, Lanyalab-basin,
Hondwara, Nichaham.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COAL CLASSIFICATION</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Low Volatile Coal</i></strong></div>
        
Generally known as coking coal with low %
of volatile matter, low moisture content and ash
content upto 24%, they have good coking
properties suitable for manufacturing of hard
coke required for metallurgical purpose. About
98% of metallurgical coal is available from
Jharkhand and West Bengal.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Primary Coking coal:</b> It directly produces
hard coke for blast furnace and steel melting
furnace. It is found only in Jharia coal field of
Jharkhand.</li>
        <li><b>Medium Coking coal:</b> Used in matching
blends with Prime Coking coal. It is found in
Raniganj, Jharia, East and west Bokaro, Ramgarh,
Karnapura and Kanhan valley.</li>
        <li><b>Semi to weak Coking Coal:</b> Used in
matching blends with above two types. It is found
in Dishergarh, Sanctoria and Hatral, Ponitai and
Sonhat coal field.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>High Volatile Coal</i></strong></div>

It has volatile matter above 30%, high moisture
of 10%. It is free burning coal, suitable for steamraising, 
commonly known as non-coking coal. They are used in industries for general heating,
in steam raising in thermal power generation, in
steam locomotive, steam ships, brick-burning, in
chemical industries and as domestic fuel.
The total known geological reserves of all
types of coal in Gondwana and tertiary coalfields
stands estimated at 208.75 billion tonnes as on
January 1, 1999. The reserves of lignite have been
estimated at a little over 29.36 billion tonnes out
of which the major contributor is the lignite basins
of Tamil Nadu.
During 1999-2000, the productions of coal and
lignite are estimated to be about 296 million
tonnes and 21 million tonnes respectively.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Thermal Energy</i></strong></div>

It has a special significance in areas where
geographical conditions are not favourable for
hydroelectricity. In states of Assam, Jharkhand,
Gujarat, Mizoram and West Bengal it accounts
for over 90% of installed capacity. Some of the
major thermal power plants are:

The modern petro-chemical industries,
cement and fertilizer industries and locomotive
all so heavily depend on this mineral liquid that
possession of oil-wells alone makes a country or
a region economically well off. Petroleum is
always found in pre-existing shallow basins or
geosynclines characterized by marine life
sedimentation and subduction.
In India most of the petroleum occurrences
are associated with anticlines and faults traps in
the rocks formation of Tertiary times. However
most of the areas in India are of Pre-Cambrian
age which is regarded as highly unfavourable
regions for oil-field.
Major Petro-rocks area in India can be
identified as:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Upper Assam Basin: Brahmaputra valley
including the whole North East.</li>
        <li>West Bengal Basin: Sunderban and coastal

</ol>
In Cambay region oil was discovered in
Bombay High in 1974 and in R-12, B-37, B-38 and
N-Bassein recently.
<br>
<br>
Region wise 59% of reserves are localized in
the western part including Gujarat and West coast
off shore. About 38% reserve is located in the
eastern part including Assam-Arakan belt,
W.Bengal, East coast and the off-shore area in Bay
of Bengal. About 3% reserve is concentrated in
the northern part.

Nuclear Energy is obtained from uranium and
thorium. Uranium is available in copper belt of
Jharkhand and the rocks of Aravali range and
Monazite sands of Kerala. Nuclear power
contributes 2.9% of total power generation. Most
of the nuclear power plants in India have been

Hydro electricity is a renewable, cheap, clean
and environmentally benign source of energy.
India has huge potential of over 84,000 MW but
only a small percentage of the total is developed.
This is due to certain geographical factors as well
as because of developing stage of economy.
Most of the river regimes in India are
extremely erratic because they are fed by
monsoon winds which are highly seasonal and
whimsical. Moreover, many rivers do not have
natural waterfall and huge capital have to be
invested for constructing dam. Most of the sites
suitable for generating hydro electricity are
located away from the consuming centre as a
result of which a lot of energy is wasted.
Some of the states more dependent on
hydroelectricity are:
