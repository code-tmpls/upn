<h3>Transport & Communication</h3>

Transport and Communication facilities are
necessary for the healthy growth of country. Road
and rail transport are well developed in India
with ample scope for the development of water
transport. Ocean waterways are already well
developed. Inland waterways require
improvement.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Railways</i></strong></div>

Trains are the most important means of
transport. They account for nearly three-fourth
of the passenger traffic and four-fifth of the freight
traffic in India. Indian railways system is the
largest in Asia and the fourth largest in the world.
It is the biggest departmental public undertaking
in the country. It is also the world’s second largest
railway system under a single management. The
first train in India steamed off from Bombay to
Thane, a stretch of 34 km. in 1853. The network
of railway has increased upto 63,465 km.
<br>
<br>
The Indian railways operate in three different
gauges mainly-Broad Gauge, Metre Gauge and
Narrow Gauge. The broad gauge accounts for
nearly 50% followed by metre gauge 43% of the
total route length. Railways are divided into 17
zones, headed by a General Manager who is
responsible to the Railway Board for operation,
maintenance and financial matters. Out of the 17
zones, Northern Railways having length 10,995
km is the longest route.
<br>
<br>
Container Service: Indian Railway has
introduced a new marketing strategy of container
services in 1980 with 7 container depots which in
1996 has expanded to 32 locations. The Container
Corporation of India (CONCOR), a public sector
undertaking, provide door to door services for
domestic users, transportation in bulk for small

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Road Transport</i></strong></div>

India’s road network is one of the largest in
the world; the total length of the roads being more
than 33 lakh km at present. Karnataka, with a total
road length of about 64,000 km, leads followed
by Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. Roads are
most suitable for short and medium distance.
Other advantages include flexibility, reliability,
speed and door to door service. For the purpose
of maintenance and construction, roads are
classified into:
    <br>
    <br>
National Highways, State Highways, Village
Roads, Border Roads, International Highways.
There are about 30 National Highways
connecting state capitals and have been
constructed by the Central government. The
present National Highway system includes a total
length of 38517 km. It constitutes only 2% of total
road length and carries nearly 40% of the road
traffic. 
<br>
<br>
The National highways No-7 is the longest
highways of India. At present India has 5 express
highways. They are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Western</li>

        <li>Between Sukinda mines and Paradeep</li>
        <li>Between Durgapur and Calcutta</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Plan of Super National Highways: After
the National Highways, there is a plan under the
consideration of Central Road Transport Ministry
to create Super National Highways. Through
these Super National Highways of about 14,000
km length, there is a plan to link big sea ports of
the country with important cities. In the building
of these Highways, the role of Private Sector will
be important. This will be done on the basis of
BOT (Build Operate Transfer) by Private Sector.
The National Highway Authority of India
(NHAI) was constituted under the National
Highway Authority of India Act 1988 and was
made operational in February 1995. Initially it was
entrusted with the task of implementing five
externally aided NH improvement projects.
Subsequently it has been mandated to implement
the National Highways Development Project
(NHDP) comprising 4/6 Lanning of 13252 km of
national highways having two components:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Golden Quadrilateral connecting
Delhi-Mumbai-Chennai-Kolkata-Delhi</li>
        <li>North-South and East-West corridors
(7300 km.), connecting Srinagar to Kanya Kumari
and Silchar to Porbandar, respectively.</li>
    </ul>
