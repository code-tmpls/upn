<h3>Indian Pre-History</h3>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The idea of pre-history is barely 200 years old. And
so is the word pre-history; it was fi rst used by M.
Tournal in 1833.</li>
<li>Dr. Primrose rediscoverd Indian pre-history
by discovering prehistoric implements (stone
knives and arrow heads) in 1842 at a place called
Lingsugur in Karnataka.</li>
<li>Robert Bruce was another person who enriched
our knowledge about Indian prehistory when he
discovered a large number of prehistoric sites in
South India and collected Stone Age artifacts.</li>
<li>These early efforts could not place India on the
prehistoric map of the world.</li>
<li>Sir Mortimer Wheeler's efforts in 1921, resulted in
our knowledge of the entire pre historic culture
sequence of India, putting India fi rmly on the world
map of prehistory.</li>
<li>As regards the early man; no fossils of early man
have been found in the entire subcontinent, but
their presence is indicated by stone tools dated
around 250,000 BC. Earliest traces of human activity
in India go back to the second Inter-Glacial period
between 400,000 and 200,000 B.C.</li>
<li>From their first appearance to around 3000
B.C. humans used only stone tools for different
purposes. Based on the tool mining traditions, this
period is therefore known as the Stone Age and
the entire Stone Age culture has been divided into
3 main stages i.e. Paleolothic (early or Old Stone
Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) and Neolithic
(New Stone Age).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Palaeolithic Age
(500,000 B.C.–8000 B.C.)</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Palaeolithic Age commenced from the time
when the earliest man learnt the art of making stone
tools. The greatest achievement of the earliest man
could be traced to his learning as to how to make a
fi st hatchet, the spear and the fi re.</li>
<li>In India, the Palaeolithic Age developed in the
Pleistocene period or the Ice Age and was spread
in practically all parts of India except the alluvial
parts of Ganga and Indus.</li>
<li>Food gathering and hunting were the main
occupations of the people of this phase and
Palaeolithic men learnt to use animal skins for
wrapping their dead bodies.</li>
<li>Man during this period used tools of unpolished,
undressed rough stones and lived in caves and rock
shelters. They had no knowledge of agriculture,
fi re or pottery of any material and mainly used
hand axes, cleavers, choppers, blades, scrapers
and burins. Their tools were made of a hard rock
called 'quartzite' and hence Palaeolithic men are
also called 'Quartzite Men'.</li>
<li>Homo sapiens fi rst appeared in the last of this
phase and the Palaeolithic man belonged to the
Negrito race.</li>
<li>Sir Robert Bruce Foot discovered the fi rst Palaeolithic
stone tool in the Indian sub-continent near Madras
in 1863 A.D. The discovery of Indian Pre-history
got a boost after the Yale-Cambridge expedition
in 1935 under De Terra and Patterson.</li>
<li>The Paleolithic stage has been divided into
Lower Palaeolithic (250,000-100,000 B.C.), Middle
Palaeolithic (100,000-40,000 B.C.) and Upper
Paleolithic stage (40,000-10,000 B.C.) primarily
based on tool typology and technology and also
according to the nature of change in the climate.</li>
<li>The tools of the lower Paleolithic stage are mainly
hand axes, cleavers, choppers and chopping tools
and covered the greater part of the Ice Age. In this
period the climate became less humid.</li>
<li>The middle Paleolithic age tools are mainly based
on fl ake industries.</li>
<li>The upper Paleolithic stage is characterized by burins
and scrapers and a warm and less humid climate.</li>
<li>Agewise the lower Paleolithic extended upto 100,000
years ago, middle Paleolithic extended upto 40,000
years ago and upper Paleolithic up to 10,000 BC.</li>
<li>The Son and the adjacent Belan valley (Mirzapur,
UP) provide a sequence of artifacts from lower
Paleolithic to Neolithic.</li>
<li>Situated around Bhimbedka hill, in central India
near Hoshangabad on the Narmada River, the
caves and rock shelters have yielded evidence of
Paleolithic habitation.</li>
<li>At Bhimbetka near the Narmada, a series of
rockshelters have been excavated from caves. This
site lacks in Chopper and Abbevillian hand axes.</li>
<li>During middle palaeolithic age, Pithecanthropus
or Homo erectus evolved. But this cultural stage
was dominated by Neanderthal Man.</li>
<li>The upper Palaeolithic culture belongs to the last
phase of the Ice Age. This culture is marked by
the appearance of new fl int industries and the
evolution of Homo sapiens or the modern man.</li>
<li>At Chopani-Mando in the Belan valley of the
Vindhyas and the middle part of the Narmada
valley, a sequence of occupation from all the three
stages of the Paleolithic to Neolithic stage have been
found in sequence. Chopani Mando is an important
site where fossil animal bones have been found.</li>
</ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mesolithic Era
(8000 B.C.–6000 B.C.)</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Although major changes began to appear around
10,000 B.C. the Mesolithic era seems to have started
around 9000 B.C. and 8000 B.C. with the folding up
of the Ice Age and continued at certain places till
4000 B.C.</li>
<li>In this age, climate changes brought about changes
in the fauna and fl ora and made it possible for
human beings to move to new areas. Since then
there haven't been major changes in the climate.</li>
<li>The Mesolithic era is characterized by the reduction
in the size of well established tool types from the
archaeological point of view with a decrease in
size of some artifacts and the presence of a higher
proportion of 'geometric' microliths.</li>
<li>Microliths, fi rst discovered from the Vindhyan
rock shelters by C.L. Carlyle in 1867; are the
characteristic tools of the era comprising of
pointed, cresconic blades, scrapers, etc. all made
of stone. These are very small in size with their
length varying from 1-8 cm. Blackened blade, core,
point, triangle, lunate and trapeze are the main
Mesolithic tools. However some tools used earlier
like choppers, burins and scrapers continue.</li>
<li>The hunting implements are spears with multiple
barbs apparently obtained easily by attaching
microliths. The crude material is chert, agate,
carnelian and quartz.</li>
<li>Bagor, a Mesolithic site in Rajasthan on the river
Kothari is the largest Mesolithic site in India also
from where systematic burials of skeletons have
been found.</li>
<li>Tapti, Narmada, Mahi and Sabarmati river basins
in Gujarat have yielded many Mesolithic sites.</li>
<li>Langhnaj in Gujarat is the fi rst discovered site in
the arid zone to demonstrate the development of
a Mesolithic culture.</li>
<li>The site of Chopani Mando in Allahabad provides a
continuous sequence from late upper Palaeolithic to
late Mesolithic stage with crude handmade pottery.
Here round hut fl oors were found.</li>
<li>In Peninsular India the Mesolithic industry is based
on milky quartz. A new feature in the tool industry
is the appearance of ‘D’ shaped, transverse
arrowhead.</li>
<li>A large number of animal bones were found in the
rock-shelters of Adamgarh in Madhya Pradesh
which indicate domestication of animals only, not
a pastoral economy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lifestyle</i></strong></div>


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The age represents the hunting-gathering nomadic
pastoral stages of human social evolution as the
people lived on hunting, fi shing and food gathering.
At a later stage, they also domesticated animals.</li>
<li>The people of this age achieved their special
adaptation as early as 8000 B.C. which coincides
with the same in both Europe and Africa.</li>
<li>The last phase of this age saw the beginning of
plane cultivation.</li>
<li>The Palaeolithic age does not yield any information
about the religious practices of the people but
with the Mesolithic age the fi rst archaeological
information about them becomes available. The
burials and rock paintings give us ideas about the
development of religious practices.</li>
<li>Some Mesolithic sites like Bhimbetka, Adamgarh,
Pratapgarh and Mirzapur are famous for their rich
art and paintings. Animals are the most frequent
subjects of all these paintings with the most
frequently represented ones being deer or antelope
whereas paintings of tigers and monkeys are rare.</li>
<li>Animal headed human fi gures also appear.</li>
<li>This is also the period when we fi nd evidence
of carefully burying the dead, which shows the
beginning of belief in life after death.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Neolithic Era
(6000 B.C.–1000 B.C.)</i></strong></div>


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In the world context, the Neolithic age began
around 9000 B.C. but in the Indian context it began
in 7000 B.C. Mehrgarh in Baluchistan is the only
site belonging to that period.</li>
<li>Regular Neolithic attributes have been found from
around 5000 B.C. and in South Indian context
Neolithic settlements appeared around 2500 B.C.</li>
<li>The principal features of Neolithic culture are crop
cultivation, animal husbandry and settled life. The
last two coming into existence in the last phase of
Mesolithic culture.</li>
<li>During this period people depended on stone
implements but used stones other than quartzite
for making tools which were more lethal, more
fi nished and more polished. The phase is known
for grinding and polishing of tools.</li>
<li>The stone tools can be studied under two groups:
(a) Ground and polished stone implements and (b)
small and chipped stone tools.</li>
<li>Ground and polished stone implements are
associated with the Neolithic culture because
of their links with food-producing stage and
domestication of animals.</li>
<li>Small and chipped stone tools had been continuing
from earlier Mesolithic levels which are generally
termed as microliths.</li>
<li>The Neolithic people at certain point of time started
making potteries. On this basis Neolithic culture
has been divided into aceramic Neolithic and
ceramic Neolithic ages.</li>
<li>At certain Neolithic levels we get the evidence of
use of metal (copper being the earliest metal). Such
levels are termed as Chalcolithic level.</li>
<li>Important sites of this age are Burzahom and
Gufkral in J&K (famous for pit dwelling, stone tools
and graveyards in houses), Maski, Brahmagiri,
Tekkalakota in Karnataka, Paiyampatti in Tamil
Nadu, Piklihal and Hallur in Andhra Pradesh,
Garo hills in Meghalaya, Chirand and Senuwar in
Bihar (known for remarkable bone tools), Amri,
Kot diji, etc.</li>
<li>In Baluchistan , sites of Neolithic age include Kili
Ghul Muhammad, Rana Ghundai, Anjira, Siahdamb and Mundigak.</li>
<li>In the Indus system the most Neolithic site is at
Mehrgarh in the Kacchi Plain regarded as the 'bread
basket' of Baluchistan. The Neolithic stratum at
Mehrgarh seems to have emerged from a locally
established Mesolithic substratum.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lifestyle</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In the northern Himalayas, the best known Neolithic
site is Burzahom in Kashmir where the earliest
occupation was characterized pit dwellings with
conical roofs. The site also gives evidence of a
rectangular chopper of a kind not known in India.</li>
<li>In Burzahom sometimes dogs and wolves were
found buried with their owners.</li>
<li>Later on, there comes evidence of mud brick
houses, copper arrow heads and a number of
burials and graves with goods. This phase also
yield a stray painted pot showing a typical early
Indus buffalo deity.</li>
<li>Gufkral, literally 'the cave of the potter' is another
important Neolithic site in Kashmir where the
earliest seize yield pit dwellings without pottery.
However in subsequent phases coarse grey pottery
was used and a large number of bone tools occur.</li>
<li>People domesticated sheep, goats and oxen and
animal remains of early periods corroborate it.</li>
<li>Cultivation of wheat, barley, fruits, corn like ragi
and horsegram and lentils have been reported from
the beginning and between 6000 B.C. and 5000 B.C.
there was a pattern of subsistence based on wheat,
barley, sheep, goats and cattle.</li>
<li>The remains of charred grains of paddy husk and
wheat are quite visible at Chirand in Bihar, the
hand-made pots as well.</li>
<li>The people of Kachar Hills of Assam lived in mudwalled 
    houses and their hand-made pots were
decorated with basket impressions.</li>
<li>Koldhiwa and Mahagara lying south of Allahabad
have thrown evidence of many strata of circular
huts alongwith a crude handmade pottery. The
most interesting fi nd is evidence of rice suggested
around 5440 and 4530 B.C. which is the oldest
evidence of rice not only in India but also anywhere
in the world.</li>
<li>Instances of earlier cave dwelling have also been
discovered with walls decorated of scenes of
hunting and dancing.</li>
<li>Neolithic man also knew the art of making boats
and could weave cotton and wool to make cloth.</li>
<li>In the later phase of the Neolithic stage people
led a more settled life and lived in circular and
rectangular houses made of mud and reed.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chalcolithic Period</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The end of the Neolithic period saw the use of
metals of which copper was the fi rst. A culture
based on the use of stone and copper arrived called
the Chalcolithic phase meaning the stone-copper
phase.</li>
<li>The fi rst full-fl edged village communities evolved
in the Chalcolithic phase which was chronologically
antecedents to Harappan people. Rafi que Mughal
of Pakistan named there settlements as Early
Harappan culture.</li>
<li>Though some Chalcolithic cultures are
contemporary of Harappan and some of preHarappan cultures but most Chalcolithic cultures
are post-Harappan.</li>
<li>Though Chalcolithic cultures mostly used stone and
copper implements, the Harappans used bronze (an
alloy of copper and tin) on such a scale that Harappan
culture is known as a Bronze Age Culture.</li>
<li>Apart from stone tools, hand axes and other objects
made from copperware were also used.</li>
<li>The evidences of relationship with Afghanistan,
Iran and probably Central India and visible at
Mehargarh.</li>
<li>The Chalcolithic culture at many places continued
till 700 B.C. and sometime around 1200 B.C. the use
of iron seems to have begun in the Chalcolithic level
itself. The use of iron subsequently revolutionized
the culture making progress and by 800 B.C. a
distinct Iron Age came into existence.</li>
<li>The Chalcolithic people used different types of
pottery of which black and red pottery was most
popular. It was wheel made and painted with
white line design.</li>
<li>The Chalcolithic people were not acquainted with
burnt bricks and generally lived in thatched houses.
It was a village economy.</li>
<li>They venerated the mother goddess and
worshipped the bull.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sites</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Important sites of this stage are spread in
Rajasthan, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Bihar,
Madhya Pradesh, etc.</li>
        <li>The Chalcolithic culture in Rajasthan is known as
Banas culture after the river of the same name and
is also known as Ahar culture after the typesite.</li>
        <li>In the Malwa region the important Chalcolithic
sites are Nagda, Kayatha, Navdatoli, and Eran.
Mud-plastered fl oors are a prominent feature of
Kayatha.</li>
        <li>The Kayatha culture is characterized by a sturdy
red-slipped ware painted with designs in chocolate
colour, a red painted buff ware and a combed ware
bearing incised patterns.</li>
        <li>The Ahar people made a distinctive black-and-red
ware decorated with white designs.</li>
        <li>The Malwa ware is rather coarse in fabric, but has
a thick buff surface over which designs are made
either in red or black.</li>
        <li>The Prabhas and Rangpur wares are both derived
from the Harappan, but have a glossy surface due
to which they are also called Lustrous Red Ware.</li>
        <li>Jorwe ware too is painted black-on-red but has a
matt surface treated with a wash.</li>
        <li>The settlements of Kayatha cutlure are only a few
in number, mostly located on the Chambal and its
tributaries. They are relatively small in size and the
biggest may be not over two hectares.</li>
        <li>In contrast to small Kayatha culture settlements
those of Ahar cultures are big. At least three of
them namely Ahar, Balathal and Gilund are of
several hectares.</li>
        <li>Stone, mud bricks and mud were used for the
construction of houses and other structures.</li>
        <li>Excavations reveal that Balathal was a wellfortifi ed settlement.</li>
        <li>The people of Malwa culture settled mostly on
the Narmada and its tributaries. Navdatoli, Eran
and Nagada are the three best known settlements
of Malwa culture. Navadatoli measures almost
10 hectares and is one of the largest Chalcolithic
settlements.</li>
        <li>It has been seen that some of these sites were
fortifi ed and Nagada had even a bastion of mudbricks. Eran similarly had a fortifi cation wall with
a moat.</li>
        <li>The Rangpur culture sites are located mostly on
Ghelo and Kalubhar rivers in Gujarat.</li>
        <li>The Jorwe settlement is comparatively larger in
number.</li>
        <li>Prakash, Daimabad and Inamgaon are some of
the best known settlements of this culture. The
largest of these is Daimabad which measured 20
hectares.</li>
        <li>From Mesolithic culture onwards, all the culture
types coexisted and interacted with each other.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lifestyle</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Chalcolithic people built rectangular and
circular houses of mud wattled-and-daub. The
circular houses were mostly in clusters. These
houses and huts had roots of straw supported on
bamboo and wooden rafters. Floors were made
of rammed clay and huts were used for storage
also.</li>
        <li>People raised cattle as well as cultivated both Kharif
and Rabi crops in rotation. Wheat and barley were
grown in the area of Malwa. Rice is reported to have
been found from Inamgaon and Ahar. These people
also cultivated jowar and bajra and so also kulthi
ragi, green peas, lentil and green and black grams.</li>
        <li>Religion was an important aspect which interlinked
all Chalcolithic cultures. The worship of mother
goddess and the bull was in vogue. The bull cult
seems to have been predominant in Malwa during
the Ahar period.</li>
        <li>A large number of these both naturalistic as well as
stylised lingas have been found from most of the
sites of Chalcolithic settlements. The naturalistic
ones may have served as votive offerings, but the
small stylised ones may have been hung around
the neck as the Lingayats do today.</li>
        <li>The Mother Goddess is depicted on a huge storage
jar of Malwa culture in an applique design. She is
fl anked by a woman on the right and a crocodile
on the left, by the side of which is represented the
shrine.</li>
        <li>Likewise the fiddle-shaped figurines probably
resembling Srivatsa, the symbol of Lakshmi, the
Goddess of wealth in historical period represent a
mother Goddess.</li>
        <li>In a painted design on a pot, a deity is shown with
dishevelled hair, recalling Rudra.</li>
        <li>A painting on a jar found from Daimabad shows
a deity surrounded by animals and birds such as
tigers and peacocks. Some scholars compare it
with the 'Shiva Pashupati' depicted on a seal from
Mohenjodaro.</li>
        <li>Two fi gurines from Inamgaon, belonging to late
Jorwe culture, are identifi ed as proto-Ganesh, who
is worshipped for success.</li>
        <li>Several headless figurines found at Inamgaon
have been compared with Goddess Visira of the
Mahabharata.</li>
        <li>Fire-worship seems to have been a very widespread
phenomenon among the Chalcolithic people of
Pre-historic India as fi re-altars have been found
from a large number of Chalcolithic sites during
the course of excavations.</li>
        <li>The occurence of pots and other funerary objects
found along with burials of the Malwa and Jorwe
people indicate that people had a belief in life after
death.</li>
        <li>The Chalcolithic farmers had made considerable
progress in ceramic as well as metal technology.
The painted pottery was well made and well fi red
in kiln, it was fi red at a temperature between 500-
700°C.</li>
        <li>In metal tools we fi nd axes, chisels, bangles, beads,
etc. mostly made of copper. The copper was obtained,
perhaps, from the Khetri mines of Rajasthan.</li>
        <li>Gold ornaments were extremely rare and have been
found only in the Jorwe culture.</li>
        <li>An ear ornament has been found from Prabhas in
the Godavari valley also.</li>
<li>The fi nd of crucibles and pairs of tongs of copper
at Inamgaon in Maharashtra shows the working of
goldsmiths.</li>
<li>Chalcedony drills were used for perforating beads
of semi-precious stones.</li>
<li>Lime was prepared out of Kankar and used for
various purposes like painting houses and lining the storage bins, etc.</li>

    </ul>
