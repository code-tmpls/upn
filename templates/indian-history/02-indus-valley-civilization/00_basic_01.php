<h3>Indus Valley Civilization</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Origin and Phases</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Indus Valley civilization was an ancient
civilization thriving along the Indus river and the
Ghaggar-Hakra river in what is now Pakistan and
north-western India. Among other names for this
civilization is the Harappan civilization in reference
to the fi rst excavated city of Harappa.</li>
<li>An alternative term for the culture is SaraswatiSindhu civilization based on the fact that most of
the Indus Valley sites have been found along the
Ghaggar-Hakra river.</li>
<li>R.B. Dayaram Sahni first discovered Harappa
(on Ravi) in 1921. R.D. Banerjee discovered
Mohenjodaro or 'Mound of the Dead' (on Indus)
in 1922. Sir John Marshal played a crucial role in
both these.</li>
<li>Harappan civilization forms part of the proto
history of India i.e. the script is there, but it cannot
be deciphered and belongs to the Bronze Age.</li>
<li>The Indus valley civilization gradually developed
to a full-fledged civilization which has been
established through a continuous sequence of strata
named as Pre-Harappan, Early Harappan, Mature
Harappan and Late Harappan stages or phases.</li>
<li>The long term indigenous evolution of this
civilization which obviously began on the periphery
of the Indus Valley in the hills of eastern Baluchistan
and then extended so far into the plains, can be
documented by an analysis of four sites which have
been excavated in recent years: Mehargarh, Amri,
Kalibangan and Lothal which refl ect the sequence
of the four important phases or stages in pre and
proto history in the north-west region of the Indian
sub-continent.</li>
<li>The sequence begins with the transition of
nomadic herdsmen to settled agriculturists in
eastern Baluchistan (First Phase), continues with
the growth of large villages and the rise of towns
in the Indus Valley (Second Phase), leads to the
emergence of the great cities (Third Phase), and
fi nally, ends with their decline (Fourth Phase).</li>
<li>Mediterranean, Proto-Australoid, Mongoloids and
Alpines formed the bulk of the population, though
the fi rst two were more numerous.</li>
<li>More than 100 sites belonging to this civilization
have been excavated.</li>
<li>According to radio-carbon dating, it spread from
the year 2500-1750 B.C.</li>
<li>Copper, bronze, silver and gold were known but
not iron.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Geographical Extent</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Covered parts of Punjab, Sindh, Baluchistan,
Gujarat, Rajasthan and some parts of Western U.P.
It extended from Manda in Jammu in the north
to Daimabad in the south and from Alamgirpur
in western U.P. to Sutkagendor in Baluchistan in
the west.</li>
        <li>Major sites in Pakistan are Harappa (on river
Ravi in west Punjab), Mohenjodaro (on Indus),
Chanhu-Daro (Sindh), etc. In India the major
sites are Lothal, Rangpur and Surkotda (Gujarat),
Kalibangan (Rajasthan), Banawali (Hissar) and
Alamgirpur (western U.P.)</li>
        <li>The largest and the latest site in India is Dholavira
in Gujarat. Dr. J.P. Joshi and Dr. R.S. Bisht were
involved in it.</li>        
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Town Planning</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Indus Valley people were primarily urban
people. Elaborate town-planning following the
Grid System. Roads were well cut dividing the
town into large rectangular or square blocks. Lamp
posts at intervals indicate the existence of street
lightening. Flanking the streets, lanes and by-lanes
were well-planned houses. The streets were quite
broad varying from 9 feet to 34 feet in breadth.</li>
        <li>Burnt bricks of good quality were used for building
material except in Rangpur and Kalibangan.
Elsewhere in the contemporary world mud bricks
were used. No pottery-kiln was allowed to be built
within the four walls of the city.</li>
        <li>Houses were often of two or more storey, of
varying sizes but were quite monotonous - a square
courtyard around which were a number of rooms.
The windows faced the streets and the houses had
tiled bathrooms. It is especially noteworthy that
almost every house had its own wells, bathrooms,
courtyards, drains and kitchens.</li>
        <li>There was a good drainage system and drains were
made of mortar, lime and gypsum and covered 
with large brick slabs for easy cleaning which
shows a developed sense of health and sanitation.
Every house had its own soak-pit which collected
all the sediments and allowed only the water to
fl ow into the street drain. House drains emptied
themselves into the main drains which ran under
the main streets and below many lanes. There were
special trenches constructed outside every city for
the rubbish to be thrown in them.
</li>
<li>The towns were divided into two parts: Upper
part or Citadel and the Lower part. The Citadel
was an oblong artifi cial platform some 30-50 feet
high and about some 400-200 yards in area. It was
enclosed by a thick (13 m in Harappa) crenellated
mud brick wall. The Citadel comprised of public
buildings whereas the lower part comprised of
public dwellings.</li>
<li>In Mohenjodaro, a big public bath (Great Bath)
measuring 12 m by 7 m and 2.4 m deep has been
found. Steps led from either end to the surface,
with changing rooms alongside. The Great Bath
was probably used for ritual bathing.</li>
<li>Lamp posts at intervals indicate the existence of
street lighting.</li>
<li>There were special series constructed for the
travelers and a system of watch and word at night
also existed.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Organization/
Municipalities</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>There is no clear idea of the political organization
of the Indus valley people. Perhaps they were more
concerned with commerce and they were possibly
ruled by a class of merchants.</li>
        <li>Also there was an organization like a municipal
corporation to look after the civic amenities of the
people.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economic Life
Agriculture</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Indus people sowed seeds in the fl ood plains
in November, when the fl ood water receded, and
reaped their harvests of wheat and barley in April,
before the advent of the next fl ood which indicated
agriculture and knowledge of calendar reading.</li>
        <li>The people grew wheat, barley, rai, peas, sesamum,
mustard, rice (in Lothal), cotton, dates, melon, etc.
The Indus people were the fi rst to produce cotton
in the world.</li>
        <li>In Kalibangan, fi elds were ploughed with wooden
ploughs.</li>
        <li>Domestication of animals was done on a large scale.
Besides the cattle, sheep, pigs, camels, cats and dogs
were domesticated. Horses weren't in regular use
but elephant was. Remains of horse at Surkotda
and dogs with men in graves in Ropar have been
discovered.</li>
        <li>Produced suffi cient to feed themselves. There was
no exchange of foodgrains/export or import.</li>
        <li>Food grains were stored in granaries. Eg. In
Harappa and Mohenjodaro.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

    

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trade and Commerce</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Well-knit external and internal trade. There was no
metallic money in circulation and trade was carried
through Barter System.</li>
        <li>Weights and measures of accuracy existed in
Harappan culture (found at Lothal). The weights
were made of limestone, steatite, etc. and were
generally cubical in shape.</li>
        <li>16 was the unit of measurement (16, 64, 160, 320).</li>
        <li>Flint tool-work, shell-work, bangle-making
(famous in Kalibangan), etc. were practiced. Raw
materials for these came from different sources:
gold from north Karnataka, silver and Lapis Lazuli
from Afghanistan and Iran, copper from Khetri and
Baluchistan, etc.</li>
        <li>Bead making factories existed in Chanu daro and
Lothal. They were items of export.</li>
        <li>A dockyard has been discovered at Lothal.
Rangpur, Somnath and Balakot functioned as
seaports. Sutkagendor and Sutkakoh functioned
as outlets.</li>
        <li>The inland transport was carried out by bullock
carts.</li>
<li>Every merchant or mercantile family probably
had a seal bearing an emblem often of a religious
character, and a name or brief description, on one
side. The standard Harappa seal was a square or
oblong plaque made of steatite stone. The primary
purpose of the seal was probably to mark the
ownership of property, but they may have also
served as amulets.</li>
<li>The Mesopotamian records from about 2350 B.C.
onwards refer to trade relations with Meluhha,
the ancient name of the Indus region. Harappan
seals and other material have been found at
Mesopotamia. There were also instances of trade
with Sumer, Babylonia, Egypt, etc.
Art and Craft</li>
<li>The Harappan culture belongs to the Bronze Age
and bronze was made by mixing tin and copper.
Tools were mostly made of copper and bronze. For
making bronze, copper was obtained from Khetri
in Rajasthan and from Baluchistan and tin from
Afghanistan.</li>
<li>The people of this culture were not acquainted with
iron at all.</li>
<li>The Indus Valley people had achieved a great skill
in drawing the fi gures of men, animals and various
other objects of nature and were fully conversant
with the art of craving with fi gures on ivory, soapstone, leather, metal and wood proving their artistic
acumen.</li>
<li>Cotton fabrics were quite common and woolens
were popular in winter.</li>
<li>One male fi gure or a statue shows that generally
two garments were worn and the female dress was
more or less like that of a male.</li>
<li>The Indus valley people were very fond of
ornaments (of gold, silver, ivory, copper, bronze
and precious stones) and dressing up. Ornaments
were worn by both men and women, rich or poor.
Women wore heavy bangles in profusion, large
necklaces, ear-rings, bracelets, fi gure-rings, girdles,
nose-studs and anklets. The Harappans were expert
bead makers.</li>
<li>They were fully conscious of the various fashions of
hair-dressing and wore beards of different styles.
Harappan Seals</li>
<li>Potter's wheel was in use. The Indus Valley
Pottery was red or black pottery and the people
indulged in dice games, their favorite pastime
being gambling.</li>
<li>The Harrapans most notable artistic achievement
was their seal engravings especially those of
animals. The red sandstone torso of a man is
particularly impressive for its realism. However
the most impressive of the fi gurines is the bronze
image of a dancing girl (identifi ed as a devdassi)
found at Mohenjodaro.</li>
<li>Maximum number of seals discovered is made of
steatite with the unicorn symbol being discovered
on the maximum number of seals.</li>
<li>For their children, the Harappans made cattle-toys
with moveable heads, model monkeys which could
slide down a string, little toy carts and whistles
shaped like birds all of terracotta.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religious Life</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
<li>The main object of worship was the Mother Goddess
or Shakti. But the upper classes preferred a God
- nude with two horns, much similar to Pashupati
Shiva. Represented on the seal is a fi gure with
three horned heads in a yogic posture, surrounded
by an elephant, a tiger, a rhinoceros and below
his throne is a buffalo. Near his feet are two deer.
Pashupatinath represented the male deity.</li>
<li>The elaborate bathing arrangement marking the
city of Mohenjodaro would suggest that religious
purifi cation by bath formed a feature of the Indus
Valley people.</li>
<li>Phallus (lingam) and yoni worship was also
prevalent.</li>
<li>Many trees (pepal), animals (bull), birds (dove,
pigeon) and stones were worshipped. Unicorns
were also worshipped. However no temple has
been found though idolatry was practiced.</li>
<li>At Kalibangan and Lothal fi re altars have been
found.</li>
<li>Although no definite proof is available with
regard to disposal of the dead, a broad view is that
there were probably three methods of disposing
the dead - complete burial (laid towards north),
burial after exposure of the body to birds and
beasts, and cremation followed by burial of the
ashes. The discovery of cinerary urns and jars,
goblets or vessels with ashes, bones or charcoal
may however suggest that during the fl ourishing
period of the Indus valley culture, the third method
was generally practiced. In Harappa, there is one
place where evidence of coffi n burial is there. The
people probably believed in ghosts and spirits as
amulets were worn.</li>
<li>Dead bodies were placed in the north-south
orientation.</li>
<li>It appears from excavations that the people of
this culture were well-versed with surgery. For
example, some evidences have come from both
Kalibangan and Lothal hinting at head surgery.
Otherwise, they used to take recourse to black
magic, amulets etc.</li>


    </ul>
</ol>




<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Script</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
<li>The script is not alphabetical but pictographic
(about 600 undeciphered pictographs).</li>
<li>The script has not been deciphered so far, but
overlaps of letters show that it was written from
right to left in the fi rst line and left to right in the
second line. This style is called 'Boustrophedon'.
End/Decay</li>
<li>The Harappan culture lasted for around 1000
years.</li>
<li>The invasion of the Aryans, recurrent fl oods (7
fl oods), social breakup of Harappans, Earthquakes,
successive alteration in the course of the river
Indus and the subsequent drying up of the areas
in and around the major cities, etc. are listed as
possible causes for the decline of the Indus Valley
Civilization.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Sites of the Indus Valley
Civilization</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Harappa</i></strong></div>    

 Harappa is situated in Montogomery district of 
 Punjab (Pakistan). Excavations at the site have led
to the following specifi c findings:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Two rows of six granaries with brick platforms; 12
granaries together had the same area as the Great
Granary at Mohenjodaro.</li>
        <li>Working fl oors, consisting of rows of circular brick
platforms lay to the south of granaries and were
meant for threshing grain.</li>
        <li>Evidence of coffi n burial and cemetery 'H' culture.
• The dead were buried in the southern portion of
the fortifi ed area, called cemetery R-37.</li>
        <li>Single room barracks just below the walls of the
citadels for the labourers and factory workers.</li>
        <li>It has been identifi ed with Hari-Yupiya which is
mentioned in the Rigveda.</li>
        <li>Evidence of direct trade and interaction with
Mesopotamia.</li>
        <li>Discovery of a red sandstone male torso and</li>
        <li>Stone symbols of female genitals.</li>
        <li>Almost 36% of the total seals excavated in the Indus
Civilization are excavated from Harappa alone.</li>
        <li>Other discoveries include Bronze image of an 'ekka'
(vehicle) and a seal with the representation of the
sign of 'swastika' on it.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mohenjo-daro</i></strong></div>

Also known as the ‘Mound of the dead’, it lies
in Larkana district of Sind (Pakistan). Some of the
specifi c fi ndings during the excavations of Mohenjodaro include:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A college, a multi-pillared assembly hall.
• The Great Bath</li>
        <li>A large granary (the largest building of Mohenjodaro)
which suggests extreme centralization as the ruling
authorities must have fi rst brought the agricultural
produce here and then redistributed it.</li>
        <li>A piece of woven cotton alongwith spindle whorls
and needles.</li>
        <li>Superfi cial evidence of a horse or an ass.
• A pot-stone fragment of Mesopotamian origin.
• Evidence of direct trade contact with
Mesopotamia.</li>
        <li>A bronze dancing girl.</li>
        <li>Evidence of violent death of some of the inhabitants
(discovery of human skeletons put together).</li>
<li>A seal representing Mother Goddess with a plant
growing from her womb, and a woman to be
sacrifi ced by a man with a knife in his hand.</li>
<li>A bearded man</li>
<li>A seal with a picture suggesting Pashupati
Mahadev.</li>
<li>This city is also an extreme example of conservatism,
as despite having been fl ooded almost nine times,
they never tried to shift to a safer place. Rather, they
came back to the original site whenever the water
table receded. Nor did they ever try to build strong
embankments to protect themselves from fl oods.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Alamgirpur</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The famous Harappan site is considered the eastern
boundary of the indus culture. Although the caves
found here resemble those at other Harappan sites,
other fi ndings suggest that Alamgirpur developed
during the late-Harappan culture.</li>
<li>The site is remarkable for providing the impression
of cloth on a trough.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kalibangan</i></strong></div>    

Kalibangan was an important Harappan city. The
word Kalibangan means ‘black bangles’. A ploughed
fi eld was the most important discovery of the early
excavations. Later excavations at Kalibangan made
the following specifi c discoveries:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>A wooden furrow</li>
            <li>Seven fi re altars in a row on a platform suggesting
the practice of the cult of sacrifice.</li>
            <li>Remains of a massive brick wall around both the
citadel and the lower town (the second Harappan
site after Lothal to have the lower town also
walled.</li>
            <li>Bones of a camel.</li>
            <li>The skull of a child found suffering from
hydrocephalus.</li>
            <li>A tiled fl oor which bears intersecting designs of
circles.</li>
            <li>A human head with long oval eyes, thick lower
lips, receding forehead and straight pointed nose.</li>
            <li>Evidences of two types of burials:
 Burials in a rectangular grave and
 Burials in a circular grave.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kot-Diji</i></strong></div>

Kot-Diji is known more as a pre-Harappan site.
It gives the impression of a pre-Harappan fortifi ed
settlement. Houses were made of stone. The remains
of Kot-Diji suggest that the city existed in the fi rst
half of the third millennium B.C. Excavations at the
site suggest that the city was destructed by force.</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lothal/i></strong></div>    

Lothal was an important trade centre of the Harappan culture. The town planning in Lothal was different from that of Harappa and Mohenjodaro. The city
was divided into six sections. Each section was built
on a wide platform of unripe bricks. Each platform
was separated by a road with width ranging from
12 feet to 20 feet. Excavations at Lothal led to some
specifi c discoveries which include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Remains of rice husk (the only other Harappan city
where the rice husk has been found is Rangpur near
Ahmedabad).</li>
        <li>An artifi cial dock yard.</li>
        <li>Evidence of a horse from a doubtful terracotta
fi gurine.</li>
        <li>Impressions of cloth on some of the seals.</li>
        <li>Evidence of direct trade contact with
Mesopotamia.</li>
        <li>Houses with entrances on the main street (the houses
of all other Harappan cities had side entries).</li>
<li>A ship designed on a seal.</li>
<li>A terracotta ship.</li>
<li>A painting on a jar resembling the story of the
'cunning fox' and the 'thirsty crow' narrated in
Panchatantra.</li>
<li>Evidence of double burial (burying a male and
a female in a single grave) found in three graves
whereas in Kalibangan one such grave has been
found.</li>
<li>Evidence of games similar to modern day chess
and</li>
<li>An instrument for measuring 180, 90, 45 degree
angles (the instrument points to modern day
compass).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li> 
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Amri</i></strong></div>    
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Amri also gives evidence of pre-Harappan
settlement. However it lacks the fortifi cation plan
of the pre-Harappan phase. A spectacular feature
of Amri is that it gives the impression of existence
of transitional culture between pre and post
Harappan culture.</li>
        <li>Important findings at Amri include the actual
remains of rhinoceros, traces of Jhangar culture in
late or declining Harappan phase and fi r altars.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chanhu-daro</i></strong></div>    
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Excavations at Chanhu-daro have revealed three
different cultural layers from lowest to the top
being Indus culture, and the pre-Harappan Jhukar
culture and the Jhangar culture.</li>
        <li>The site is especially important for providing
evidences about different Harappan factories.
These factories produced seals, toys and bone
implements.</li>
        <li>Through excavations, the evidence of bead maker's
shops has come to light.</li>
        <li>It was the only Harappan city without a citadel.</li>
        <li>Some remarkable fi ndings at Chanhu-daro include
bronze fi gures of bullock cart and ekkas, a small
pot suggesting an inkwell, footprints of an elephant
and a dog chasing a cat</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ropar</i></strong></div>    
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Ropar is a Harappan site from where remains of
pre-Harappan and Harappan cultures have been
found.</li>
<li>Buildings at Ropar were made mainly of stone and
soil.</li>
<li>Important findings at the site include pottery,
ornaments, copper axes, chert blades, terracotta
blades, one inscribed steatite seal with typical Indus
pictographs, several burials interred in oval pits
and a rectangular mud brick chamber.</li>
<li>There is also an evidence of burying a dog below
the human burial (Though the practice was
prevalent in Burzahom in Kashmir, it was late in
the Harappan context.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Banawali</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Situated in Hissar district of Haryana, Banawali
has provided two phases of culture during its
excavations: the pre-Harappan (Phase I) and the
Harappan (Phase II).</li>
        <li>Though Phase II belonged to the Harappan period,
chess board or grid pattern of town planning was
not always followed as in other Harappan sites.</li>
        <li>The roads were not always straight nor did they
cut at right angles.</li>
        <li>It also lacked another important feature of the
Harappan civilization - a systematic drainage
system.</li>
        <li>High quality barley has been found in
excavations.</li>
<li>Other important material remains include ceramics,
steatite seal and a few terracotta sealing with typical
Indus script, ear rings shaped like leaves of a peepal
tree and terracotta bangles.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 </li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Surkotda</i></strong></div>    
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Situated in Kutch (Bhuj) district of Gujarat and
excavated by J.P. Joshi in 1972, Surkotda was an
important fortifi ed Harappan settlement.</li>
        <li>This site is important because it provides the fi rst
actual remains of horse bones.</li>
        <li>A cemetery with four pot burials with some human
bones has also been found.</li>
        <li>A grave has been found in association with a
big rock (megalithic burial), a rare fi nding of the
Harappan culture.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sutkagendor</i></strong></div>    
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sutkagendor situated in Sindh (Pakistan) was an
important coastal town of the Indus civilization.</li>
        <li>Excavations of Sutkagendor have revealed a
twofold division of the township: the Citadel and
the Lower City, it is said that Sutkagendor was
originally a port which later cut off from the sea
due to coastal uplift.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
