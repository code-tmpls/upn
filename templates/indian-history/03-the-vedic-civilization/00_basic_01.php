<h3>The Vedic Civilization</h3>

We know about the Aryans in India from the
various Vedic texts, especially the Rig Veda, which
is the earliest specimen of the Indo-European
language and the chief source of information on
the history of this period.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Many historians have given various theories
regarding the original place of the Aryans.
However, the Central Asian Theory given by Max
Muller, is the most accepted one. It states that the
Aryans were semi-nomadic pastoral people around
the Caspian Sea in Central Asia.</li>
        <li>They entered India probably through the Khyber
Pass (in the Hindukush Mountains) around 1500
B.C.</li>
        <li>The holy book of Iran 'Zend Avesta' indicates entry
of Aryans to India via Iran.</li>
        <li>The early Aryans did not have to look routes
to Indian sub-continent; for the Harappans had
crossed the high passes of the Hindukush and
reached the middle course of the Amu Darya where
they had set up a trading post at Shortughai.</li>
        <li>In the Rigvedic period, the nobles were advised to
eat from the same vessel as the vis for success.</li>
        <li>Metal came to be known as Ayas and Iron as
Krishanayas (Black Metal).</li>
        <li>The Vedic texts may be divided into two broad
chronological strata: the Early Vedic (1500-1000
B.C.) when most of the hymns of the Rig Veda were
composed and the Later Vedic (1000-600 B.C.) when
the remaining three Vedas and their branches were
composed.</li>
        
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Early Vedic or Rigvedic Period
(1500-1000 B.C.)</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
    <li>The Rig Veda is a collection of prayers offered to
Agni, Indra, Varuna and other gods by various
families of poets and sages.</li>
    <li>From Rigveda, we come to know that there were
33 gods that time who were divided into three
categories viz., heavenly gods, atmospheric god,
and earthly gods. Varuna, Surya, Aditi, Savitri
were heavenly gods. Indra, Rudra, Maruts etc. were
atmospheric gods. Agni, Soma, and Prithvi were
earthly gods.</li>
    <li>Four rivers of Afghanistan are clearly described
in the Rigveda. These are: Kubha, Krumu, Gomati
(Gomal), Suvastu (swat).</li>
    <li>It consists of ten Mandala or books of which Book
II to VII is the easiest portion. Book I and X seem
to have been the latest additions.</li>
    <li>In the Rigvedic period, the dead man's soul is said
to depart to the waters of the plants.</li>
    <li>Since the Aryans came through the mountains,
which were considered the dwelling places of
their gods, these are repeatedly mentioned in the
Rigveda. Meru, a mountain beyond the Himalayas,
is a happy divine abode in the Mahabharata and
the Puranas.</li>
    <li>The Rig Veda has many things in common with
the Avesta, which is the oldest text in the Iranian
language. The two texts use the same names for
several Gods and even for social classes.</li>
<li>The history of the later Vedic period is based mainly
on the Vedic texts which were compiled after
the age of the Rig Veda. These include the three
Vedas - Samveda, Yajurveda, Atharvaveda and
the Brahamanas, the Aranyakas, the Upanishads
and the Sutras.</li>
<li>The collection of the Vedic hymns or mantras were
known as Samhitas.</li>
<li>For purposes of singing, the prayers of the Rigveda
were set to tune and this modifi ed collection was
known as the Samveda Samhita.</li>
<li>The Yajurveda contains not only the hymns but
also the rituals which have to accompany their
recitation.</li>
<li>The Atharvaveda is completely different from the
other three Vedas. It contains charms and spells
to ward off evils and diseases. Its contents throw
light on the beliefs and practices of the non-Aryans.
Atharvaveda is the most valuable of the Vedas after
the Rig Veda for the history and sociology.</li>
<li>All the Vedic literature is together called the Shruti
and they include apart from the four Vedas, the
Brahamanas, the Aranyakas and the Upanishads.</li>
<li>The Brahamanas are a series of texts that followed
the Vedic samhitas. Each Veda has several
bhramanas attached to it. These are ritual texts.</li>
<li>Brahamanas attached to the Rigveda are Aitareya,
Kaushitaki (composed by Hotri priest). Brahamanas 
attached to Samveda are Jamini, Tandyamasha,
Panchavis, Chhandogya (composed by Udgatri
priest). Brahamanas attached to Yajurveda are
Satpatha Brahmana (composed by Adhvaryu
priest). Brahamanas attached to Atharvaveda are
Gopatha Brahamana.
</li>
<li>The Brahamanas throw light on the socio-political
life of the Aryans and form a sort of explanation of
their religion, especially sacrifi ce. They also contain
ritualistic formulae for the respective Vedas and
its priests.</li>
<li>The Aranyakas are forest books that are treaties
on mysticism and philosophy and are concluding
portion of the Brahamanas. They explain the
metaphysics and symbolism of sacrifi ce. They lay
emphasis not on sacrifi ce but on meditation. They
are infact opposed to sacrifi ce and many of the
ritualistic practices. Their stress is on moral virtues.
They form a bridge between the way of the works
(karma-marga, advocated by the Brahamanas) and
the way of knowledge (gyan-marga, advocated
by the Upanishads). Some important Aranyakas
are Aitreya Aranyaka, Kaushitaki Aryanka and
Taittiriya Aranyaka.</li>
<li>The Upanishads contain philosophical speculations.
They are generally called Vedanta which means the
end of the Vedas. One reason is that they came at
the end of the Vedic period or that they were taught
at the end of the Vedic instruction. These texts were
compiled around 600 B.C. and criticized the rituals
and laid stress on the values of right belief and
knowledge. They emphasized that the knowledge
of the self and the atma should be acquired and the
relation of atma with Brahma should be properly
understood.</li>
<li>The ten Upanishads are: Ishopanishat,
Kenopanishat, Kathopanishat, Parshnopanishat,
Mandukopanishat, Koushikopanishat ,
Thaittariyopanishat, Chandogyopanishat and
Brihadaranyaopanishat. These are commentaries
appended to the Aranyakas and deal mainly with
philosophy and religion.</li>
<li>The Puranas are 18 in number, of which the
Bhagawat Purana and Vishnu Purana are the most
important.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Geographical Spread</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The early Aryans settled in eastern Afghanistan,
modern Pakistan, Punjab and parts of western U.P.
The whole region in which the Aryans fi rst settled
in India is called the Land of Seven Rivers or Sapta
Sindhava (the Indus and the fi ve tributaries and
the Saraswati).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Organization</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The political organization was of monarchial
form. The tribe was known as Jan and its king as
Rajan. He was the leader in battle and protector
of the tribe. His offi ce was not hereditary and was
selected among the clanâ€™s men. The Rajan was not
an absolute monarch, for the government of the
tribe was in part the responsibility of the tribal
councils like sabhas, samitis, gana and vidhata.
Even women attended gana and vidhata only.</li>
        <li>Many clans (Vish) formed a tribe. The basic social
unit was the Kula or the family and the Kulapa was
the head of the family.</li>
        <li>The king was assisted by a number of offi cers of
which Purohita was the most important. Next
important functionary was the Senani (leader
of the army) even though there was no regular
or standing army. The military technique of the
Aryans was much advanced. The Aryans succeeded
everywhere because they possessed chariots driven
by horses.</li>
        <li>There was no regular revenue system and the
kingdom was maintained by voluntary tribute
(Bali) of his subjects and booty won in battle.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Life</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
<li>The term Varna was used for colour, the Aryans
being fair and the Dasas dark.</li>
<li>Family was the basic unit of society and was
patriarchal in nature. But women enjoyed equal
power with men. Marriage was usually monogamous
and indissoluble, but there are a few instances of
polyandry, levirate and widow marriage. There are
no examples of child-marriage. The marriageable
age seems to have been 16 to 17.</li>
<li>Both dowry and bride price were recognized
during the Early Vedic period.</li>
<li>The word 'Arya' came to refer to any person who
was respected.</li>
<li>Aryans were fond of soma, sura, food and dresses.
Soma was drunk at sacrifi ces and its use was
sanctifi ed by religion. Sura was purely secular and
more potent and was disapproved by the priestly
poets.</li>
<li>Throughout the Vedic period, education was
imparted orally. Unlike the Harappans, the Aryans
do not seem to have a system of writing.</li>
<li>The Aryans loved music and played the flute,
lute and harp. There are references to singing and
dancing girls. People also delighted in gambling. 
They enjoyed chariot racing. Both men and women
wore ornaments.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economy</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Their bronze smiths were highly skilled and
produced tools and weapons much superior to
those of Harappa culture. There were artisans like
carpenters, weavers, cobblers, potters, etc.</li>
        <li>Aryans followed a mixed economy - pastoral and
agricultural - in which cattle played a predominant
part. Most of their wars were fought for cow (most
important form of wealth). Cattle were in fact a sort
of currency and values were reckoned in heads
of cattle (man's life was equivalent to that of 100
cows), but they were not held sacred at the time.
The horse was almost as important as the cow.</li>
        <li>Standard unit of exchange was the cow. At the
same time coins were also there (gold coins like
Nishka, Krishnal and Satmana). Gavyuti was used
as a measure of distance and Godhuli as a measure
of time.</li>
        <li>Reference to money lending first occurs in
Shatapatha Brahmana, which describes a usurer
as Kusidin.</li>
        <li>Lived in fortifi ed mud settlements.</li>
        <li>Physicians were then called 'Bhishakas'.</li>
        <li>The staple crop was 'yava' which meant barley.
Religion</li>
        <li>The Aryans personifi ed the natural forces and
looked upon them as living beings.</li>
        <li>The most important divinity was Indra who played
the role of warlord (breaker of forts â€“ Purandar and
was also associated with storms and thunder).</li>
<li>The second position was held by Agni (fi re-god).
He is considered an intermediary between gods
and men.</li>
<li>Varuna occupied the third position. He personifi ed
water and was supposed to uphold the natural
order (Rta). He was ethically the highest of all
Rigvedic gods.</li>
<li>Soma was considered to be the god of plants.
Maruts personifi ed the storms.</li>
<li>Some female deities are also mentioned like Aditi
and Usha, who represented the appearance of
dawn.</li>
<li>Didn't believe in erecting temples or idol worship.
Worshipped in open air through yajnas.</li>
<li>Aryans didn't worship animals - only gods in
man's form.</li>
<li>The Asvamedha sacrifice concluded with the
sacrifi ce of 21 sterile cows.</li>
<li>From Brihadaranyaka Upanishad we get the fi rst
exposition of the doctrine of transmigration of
soul.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Later Vedic Period/Painted Grey Ware
Phase (1000-600 B.C.)</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Geographical Spread</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>They reveal that the Aryans expanded from Punjab
over the whole of western U.P. covered by the
Ganga-Yamuna doab.</li>
        <li>In Later Vedic period, many great cities like Videha,
Kaushambhi, Kasi, Ayodhya, Hastinapur and
Indraprashtha etc. had sprung up.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Organization</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tiny tribal settlements were replaced by strong
kingdoms.</li>
        <li>The earliest legend on the origin of kingship occurs
in the Aitareya Brahmana, one of the Later Vedic
texts, perhaps of the 8th or 7th century B.C.</li>
        <li>During the Rigvedic period the Aryans had
built only small kingdoms, as they were always
busy fi ghting the non-Aryans. But now they had
crushed the resistance of the non-Aryans and had
established such powerful kingdoms as Kuru,
Panchala, Kosala, Magadha, Kasi and Anga.</li>
        <li>Powers of the king who was called the Samrat
increased. Importance of assemblies declined.
Women were no longer permitted to attend
assemblies and the term 'Rashtra' indicating
territory fi rst appeared in this period.</li>
        <li>The establishment of vast empires led to the growth
of the royal power.</li>
        <li>A regular army was maintained for the protection
of the kingdom.</li>
        <li>In the Rigvedic period we hear of three main
assistants of the king, i.e., the Purohita, the
Senani and the Gramini. But now in addition to
these offi cials many new assistants of the king
were present. References of Priest (Purohita),
Commander in chief (Senapati), Charioteer (Suta),
Treasurer (Sangrihita), Tax collector (Bhagdugha),
Chief queen (Mahisi) and the Great companion
(Aksavapa).</li>
        <li>The centre of gravity was the king and not the
priest. If there was any difference between the ruler
and the priest, it was the priest who yielded.</li>
        <li>Kings of various grades are mentioned in the Vedic
hymns. For example, the Rajaka was inferior to a
Raja who in turn was inferior to a Samrat.</li>
        <li>Political affairs, religious and social matters were
discussed by the speakers in the local assemblies.
These speakers sought the help of spells and magic
herbs to stimulate their eloquence in debate (Pras)
and overcome their rival debaters (Pratiprasita).
Social Life</li>
        <li>The four fold division of society became clear
initially based on occupation which later became
hereditary; Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas
(warriors), Vaishyas (agriculturists, cattle-rearers,
traders) and Shudras (servers of the upper three).</li>
        <li>Women enjoyed freedom and respect but their
status deteriorated compared to earlier time.</li>
<li>The institution of gotra appeared in this age
fi rst time. Gotra signifi ed descent from common
ancestors.</li>
<li>In this age also Chariot racing was the main sport
and gambling the main pastime.</li>
<li>The excavations at Hastinapur in Meerut, dating
back to about 900 B.C.-500 B.C. have revealed
settlements and faint beginning of town life. It may
be called a proto-urban site.</li>
<li>Later Vedic period, especially from around 800
B.C.- 500 B.C., is also the Sutra period. Sutra
means formula. Grihasutra contained social
rituals including sixteen sanskaras through
which individual had to pass from conception to
cremation.</li>
<li>Woman was now gradually losing her position of
importance in the religious and social sphere. The
king and the nobility had now begun to marry more
than one wife and the birth of a daughter was now
regarded as source of misery.</li>
<li>Higher education was, however, imparted to
women. The re-marriage of a widow was prevalent
and the practices of sati, child-marriage, purdah
and child infanticide were not heard of.
â€¢ Now in place of four main varnas many new castes
were born, leading to the complexities of the caste
system.</li>
<li>The life of an ordinary man was now, however,
divided into four stages popularly known as the
four Ashramas.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Types of marriages</i></strong></div>
 
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Brahma: Marriage of a duly dowered girl to a man
of the same class.</li>
        <li>Daiva: Marriage in which the father gave his
daughter to a sacrifi cial priest as part of his fees.</li>
        <li>Arsa: Marriage in which a token bride price of a
cow and a bull was paid to the daughterâ€™s father.</li>
        <li>Prajapatya: Marriage in which the father gave the
girl without any dowry and without demanding
bride price.</li>
        <li>Gandharva: Marriage often clandestine, by the
consent of the two parties.</li>
        <li>Asura: Marriage by purchase.</li>
â€¢ Rakshasa: Marriage by capture.
        <li>Paishacha: Marriage involving the seduction of a
girl while sleeping, etc.</li>
        <li>Anuloma marriage: was the marriage of higher
varna man with a lower varna woman.</li>
        <li>Pratiloma marriage: was the marriage of a lower
varna man with a higher varna woman.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Important Vedic Rituals</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Asvamedha: A king performed this sacrifi ce which
meant control over the area in which the royal horse
ran uninterrupted. The ceremony lasted for three
days at the end of which the horse sacrifi ced was
performed. The Asvamedha sacrifi ce concluded
with the sacrifi ce of 21 sterile cows.</li>
        <li>Vajapeva: A chariot race was performed in which
the king must win the race (it was fi xed). It was
meant to re-establish the supremacy of the king
over his people.</li>
        <li>Rajasuya: A sacrifi ce ceremony which conferred
supreme power on the king.</li>
        <li>Ratnahavimsi: A part of Rajasuya ceremony where
different royal offi cials (ratnins) invoked different
gods and goddesses.</li>
        <li>Upanayana: An initiation ceremony to confer dvija
status to boys of the higher varnas in their eighth
year.</li>
        <li>Pumsayam: A ceremony to procure a male child.</li>
        <li>Garbhadhana: A ceremony to promote conception
in women.</li>
        <li>Culakarma: A ceremony, also known tonsure
performed for boys in their third year.</li>
        <li>Semontannayam: A ceremony to ensure the safety
of the child in the womb.</li>
        <li>Jatkarma: A birth ceremony performed before the
cutting of the umbilical cord.
Pottery</li>
        <li>Though the Later Vedic phase has been identifi ed
with the Painted Grey Ware pottery culture, but
the fact is that this type of pottery constitutes only
about 3-15% of the total pottery found.
</li>
        <li>The later vedic people used four types of pottery:
black and red ware, black-slipped ware, painted
grey ware and red ware.</li>
        <li>Red ware for commoners was most popular and has
been found almost all over western U.P. However,
the most distinctive pottery of the period is known
as Painted Grey Ware which comprised bowls and
dishes, used either for rituals or for eating by upper
classes.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economy</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>During Later Vedic period, Krishnala berry was
unit of weight and this probably led to the use of
coinage. The Nishka replaced cow as a unit of value.
The Satamana mentioned in the Brahmanas was a
piece of gold weighing a hundred Krishnalas.</li>
        <li>Rigveda mentions only gold and copper or bronze
but Later Vedic texts mention tin, lead, silver and
iron.</li>
        <li>In addition to the cultivation of barley, wheat and
rice, many new grains such as sesame (Tila) and
beans began to be cultivated during this period
and great progress was doubtlessly made in the
methods of cultivation</li>

    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religion</i></strong></div>

        <li>Rituals and formulae became prominent in the cult

        <li>According to the scheme of four stages, life did not
begin with one's physical birth, but with the second
birth which was after the investiture ceremony or
Upanayana. The age of Upanayana was 8 years for
Brahmanas, 11 years for Kshatriyas, and 12 years
for Vaishyas.</li>
        <li>Shatpatha Brahmana says that east, west, north,
south; all should be given to priests as fee.</li>
        <li>Indra, Varuna, Surya and Agni lost their
importance. Prajapati (the creator) became
supreme. Vishnu came to be conceived as the
preserver and protector of the people.</li>
        <li>Some of the special orders came to have their own
deities e.g. Pushan responsible for well being of the
cattle, became the God of the Shudras.</li>
<li>Towards the end of the period, began a strong
reaction against the sacrifi cial cults and rituals
with the composition of the Upanishads which
valued right belief and knowledge more than
anything else.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Vedic Literature</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Vedas</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
<li>The word 'veda' comes from the root 'vidi'
signifying knowledge.</li>
<li>Vedas are also known as 'Shruti' (to hear) as they
were passed from generation through verbal
transmission.</li>
<li>Harappa is known in Vedas as 'Haryupriva'.</li>
<li>They are four in all - rigveda, samaveda, yajurveda
and atharveda.</li>
<li>The first three Vedas are known as 'Tyari' or 'trio'.
Each veda is further subdivided into Samhitas.</li>
<li>The phrase 'Arya' and 'Shudra' appearing in the
