<h3>The Mahajanapadas</h3>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>From the 16th century onwards, the widespread use
of Iron in eastern U.P. and western Bihar created
conditions for the formation of large territorial
states.</li>
<li>The new agricultural tools and implements enabled
the peasants to produce more and the extra produce
was collected by princes to meet military and
administrative needs.</li>
<li>With this the 'Janapadas' started giving way
to 'Mahajanapadas' and the land between the
Himalayas and the Narmada was divided into
16 Mahajanapadas which are mentioned in the
Buddhist literature 'Anguttar Nikaya'.</li>
<li>These are Kamboj, Gandhara, Kuru, Panchal,
Chedi, Avanti, Matsya, Sursena, Koshla, Vatsa,
Malla, Vajjis, Anga, Magadha, Kashi, Asmaka.
Of these, Magadha, Kosala or Avadh, Vatsa and
Avanti were more important.</li>
<li>Some of these were ruled by hereditary monarch
but others were republican or oligarchial states,
ruled either by representative of the people as a
whole or by nobility.</li>
<li>Of the non-monarchial clans, the most important
was the Vajjis confederacy of eight clans, the most
powerful of which were the Lichchavis ruling from
their capital at Vaishali.</li>
<li>There were matrimonial relations between the
rulers of Magadha, Kosala, Vatsa and Avanti, but
they did not prevent them from fi ghting with one
another for supremacy.</li>
<li>Ultimately the Kingdom of Magadha emerged as
the most powerful and succeeded in founding in
empire.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Magadha Empire (6-4 B.C.)</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Magadha embraced the former districts of Patna,
Gaya and parts of Shahabad and grew to be the
leading state of the time.</li>
        <li>It's success was attributed to its geographical
position i.e. proximity to rich iron deposits which
yielded effective weaponry and the benefi ts of the
fertile Ganga soil.</li>
        <li>Also elephants were fi rst used in war.</li>
        <li>Archaeologically 6th century B.C. marks the
beginning of the NBPW (Northern Black Polished
Ware); a glossy, shining type of pottery. This
marked the beginning of the Second Urbanization
in India.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Haryanka Dynasty</i></strong></div>  

The Haryanka Dynasty was originally founded
in 566 B.C. by the grandfather of Bimbisara, but the
actual foundation in the true sense is credited to
Bimbisara.





<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bimbisara (544 B.C.-492 B.C.)</i></strong></div>  
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A contemporary of Buddha, he conquered Anga
(east Bihar) to gain control over the trade routes
with the southern states.</li>
        <li>His capital was Rajgir (Girivaraja) and he
strengthened his position by matrimonial alliances
with the ruling families of Kosala, Vaishali and
Modra (3 wives).</li>
        <li>The earliest capital of Magadha was at Rajgir, which
was called 'Giriraja' at that time. His capital was
surrounded by 5 hills, the openings of which were
closed by stone walls on all sides. This made Rajgir
impregnable.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ajatshatru (492 B.C.-460 B.C.)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Bimbisara's son who killed his father and seized
the throne.</li>
        <li>Annexed Vaishali and Kosala (annexed Vaishali
with the help of a war engine which was used
to throw stones like catapults. Also possessed
a chariot to which a mace was attached, thus
facilitating mass killings). Kosala was ruled by
Prasenjit at the time.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Udayin (460-444 B.C.)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>He founded the new capital of Pataliputra situated
at the confl uence of the Ganga and the Son.</li>
        <li>It is said that Udayin was among the fi ve successor
kings who had acquired throne by patricides;
the people of Magadha fi nally outraged by this,
deposed the last of the fi ve in 413 BC and appointed
Shishunaga, a viceroy of Benaras, as king.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Shishunaga Dynasty</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Founded by a minister Shishunaga who was
succeeded by Kalashoka. The dynasty lasted for
two generations only.</li>
<li>Their greatest achievement was the destruction of
the power of Avanti and its fi nal incorporation into
the Magadhan empire.</li>
<li>The most famous event was, the capital was shifted
to Vaishali.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nanda Dynasty</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It is considered first of the non-Kshatriya
dynasties.</li>
        <li>It was founded by Mahapadma Nanda who added
Kalinga to his empire from where he brought an
image of the Jina as a victory trophy. He claimed to
be the Ekarat - the sole sovereign who destroyed
all the other ruling princes.</li>
        <li>That the Nandas controlled some parts of Kalinga
(Orissa) is borne out by the Hathigumpha
Inscription of King Kharavela, assigned to the
middle of the fi rst century B.C.</li>
        <li>Alexander attacked India during the reign of
Dhana Nanda who was called Agrammesor
Xandrammems by Greek writers, in 326 B.C.</li>
        <li>The Nandas were fabulously rich and extremely
powerful; maintaining an infantry of 2,00,000
soldiers, 60,000 cavalry and 6,000 war elephants
which supposedly checked Alexander's army from
advancing towards Magadha.</li>
        <li>They had developed an effective taxation system,
built canals and carried out irrigation projects and
had a strong army.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Foreign Invasions and Persian
Conquests of India</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>During 6th century B.C. northwestern India
had been isolated from the developments in
the rest of India and closer connections with
Persian Civilization, being politically a part of the
Achaemenied Empire.</li>
        <li>A little before 530 B.C., Cyrus (the Achaemenid
emperor of Persia) crossed the Hindukush
mountains and received tributes from the tribes of
Kamboja, Gandhara, and the trans-Indus region.</li>
        <li>During the lifetime of Buddha, the powerful
Achaemenian emperor of Persia Darius I (522-486
B.C.) captured a portion of Punjab and Sindh. The
Behistun Inscription of 519 B.C. states that Gadara
(Gandhara) was a province which sent teak.</li>
        <li>Herodotus, the famous Greek historian, considered
as father of history, mentions Gandhara as the
20th satrapy or province, counted amongst the
most populous and wealthy in the Achaemmenid
Empire.</li>
        <li>The Indian provinces provided mercenaries for the
Persian armies fi ghting against the Greeks in the
years 486-465 B.C.</li>
<li>Alexander came to India in order to reach the
easternmost parts of Darius's empire, to the
'problem of ocean', the limits of each were a puzzle
to Greek geographers and to add this fabulous
country to his list of conquests.</li>
<li>Herodotus mentions about a naval expedition
dispatched by Darius under Skylax (517 B.C.) to
explore the Indus. Herodotus says: “the population
of the Indians is by far the greatest of all the
people that we know; and they paid a tribute
proportionately larger than the rest”.</li>
<li>Xerxes utilized his Indian provinces to secure an
Indian contingent to fi ght his battles in Greece.</li>
<li>There were 'Gandharians' as well as 'Indians' in his
contingent. The former bore bows of reed and short
spears for fi ght at close quarters, while the latter,
clad in cotton also bore similar bows and arrows
tipped with iron. These Indian troops were the fi rst
Indians to fi ght in Europe.</li>
<li>The Persian Empire set the model for Mauryas as
far as Imperial pretensions are concerned. The
prevalence in the North-West of Kharosthi script
which is only a localized adaptation of Aramaic
and written from the right was perhaps a vestige
of Persian rule.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Alexander's Invasion</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
<li>Alexander was the son of Philip of Macedonia
(Greece) who invaded India in 326 B.C. At that time
North-west India was split up into a number of small
independent states like Taxila, Punjab (kingdom of
Porus), Ghandara, etc. Except Porus who fought
the famous Battle of Hydaspas (on the banks of
Jhelum) with Alexander, all other kings submitted
meekly. Ambhi (Omphis), the king of Taxila,
submitted to Alexander in about the same time.
Later, impressed by Porus, Alexander reinstated
him in power. Then Alexander captured the tribal
republic of Glauganikai (Glachukayanaka) with
its 37 towns.</li>
<li>When Alexander reached Beas his army refused
to go further, forcing him to retreat. To mark the
farthest point of his advance, he erected 12 huge
stone altars on the northern banks of the Beas. 
Remaining in India for 19 months, Alexander
finally died in Babylon in 323 B.C.
</li>
<li>Alexanders invasion opened up four distinct lines
of communication (3 by land and 1 by sea) thus
exposing India to Europe.</li>
<li>Due to this cultural contact, a cosmopolitan
school of art came up in Gandhara which was
characterized by sensuous art and continued till
the Gupta Age.</li>
<li>It also paved the way for the unifi cation of north
India under Chandragupta Maurya by weakening
the small states.</li>
<li>But the immediate effect of this expedition was
the destruction of tribes, which had survived from
earlier times.</li>
<li>The earliest instance of 'Jauhar' in recorded history
occurred when Alexander encountered the Sibis
(a rude tribe clad in skins) and the Agalassoi
(Agrasrenis). The latter suffered terribly for daring
to resist the invader. The people of one town to the
number of 20,000 men, women, and children set
their dwellings ablaze and threw themselves into
the flames.</li>
