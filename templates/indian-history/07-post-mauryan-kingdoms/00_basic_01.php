<h3>Post Mauryan Kingdoms</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Age of the Sungas and the
Satvahanas</i></strong></div>  

In eastern India, Central India and the Deccan, the
Mauryans were succeeded by a number of native rulers
such as the Sungas, Satvahanas, etc. In north-western
India they were succeeded by a number of ruling
dynasties from Central Asia.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Sunga Dynasty( 185 B.C to 73 B.C)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sunga dynasty was founded by Puhsyamitra
Sunga, a brahman of the Sunga family. His
dominion extended up to Narmada river in the
south and included cities of Patliputra, Ayodhya
and Vidisha.The capital was Patliputra</li>
        <li>Divyavadana and Taranatha depict Pushyamitra
as a veritable enemy of the Buddhists.</li>
        <li>A short Sanskrit inscription from Ayodhya mentions
two Ashvamedhas performed by Pushyamitra and
one of his viceroys who was also his relative.</li>
        <li>He also defeated the Bactrian king Demetrius.</li>
        <li>The Sungas are mentioned by name in a brief
inscription found at Barhut. In this they are clearly
associated with the kingdom of Vidisa. Perhaps
they inherited from the Mauryas a small part of
their empire.</li>
<li>The Yajnas marked the revival of Vaidika Dharma
in India.</li>
<li>The fi fth king was Bhagabhadra, whose court was
visited by Heliodorus, the Greek ambassador.</li>
<li>A Sunga king Agnimitra was the hero of Kalidasa's
Malavikagnimitram.</li>
<li>Patanjali's classic Mahabhasya was written at this
time.</li>
<li>The last ruler of Sunga dynasty, Devabhuti was
killed by his minister Vasudeva in 73 B.C.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Kanva Dynasty</i></strong></div>  
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Kanva dynasty was founded by Vasudeva, a
Brahman who killed the last Sunga king Devabhuti
in 75 B.C.</li>
<li>After a span of 45 years Kanvas were overthrowned
by Andharas or Satvahanas of the Deccan.</li>
<li>Susaraman was the last ruler.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Chetis of Kalinga</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Hathigumpha inscription (near Bhubhaneshwar,
Odisha) of Kharavela, the third ruler of the dynasty
gives information about the Chetis.</li>
<li>Kharavela pushed his kingdom beyond the
Godavari in the South.</li>
<li>He was a follower of Jainism and patronized
Jain monks for whom he Constructed udayagiri
caves.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Satvahanas or the Andhras</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In Deccan and in central India the Mauryans
were succeeded by the Satvahanas around fi rst
century B.C. and ruled for about 300 years with its
capital at Paithan or Pratisthan on the Godavari in
Aurangabad district.</li>
<li>The Matsya Purana gives a list of 30 kings in the
Satvahana line and states that their rule altogether
lasted for 460 years. The Vayu Purana gives a
shorter list of about 300 years of the Satvahana
rule.</li>
<li>Simuka was the fi rst important ruler and founder
and the greatest competitor of the Satvahanas was
the Sakas.</li>
<li>The fortunes of the family were restored by
Gautamiputra Satakarni, who defeated Sakas and
set up the capital at Paithan.</li>
<li>The name of the mother of Gautamiputra Satakarni
(A.D. 30-104) was Gautami Balasari. She has
recorded in glowing terms in an inscription
at Nasik the achievements of her son. It was a
matrilineal society.</li>
<li>Saka-Satvahana confl ict was very frequent in these
centuries and they fought with each other to have
control over the important trade routes in north
India.</li>
<li>Trade particularly with Roman empire was very
brisk, as is indicated by numerous Roman and
Satvahana coins.</li>
<li>The Satvahanas may have used gold as bullion, for
they did not issue gold coins; they issued mostly
coins of lead. They also used tin, copper and bronze
coins.</li>
<li>The Satvahanas were the fi rst rulers to make land
grants to the Brahmans. The called themselves</li>
<li>The two common constructions were the Buddhist
temples that were called 'Chaitya' and the
monasteries which were called 'Viharas'. The most
famous Chaitya is that of Karle in western Deccan.</li>
<li>The districts were called 'Aharas' as in Ashoka's
times and similarly their offi cials were known as
'Amatyas' and 'Mahamatras'.</li>
<li>They started the practice of granting tax free
villages to Brahmanas and Buddhist monks.</li>
<li>The offi cial language was Prakrit and the script
was Brahmi as in Ashokan times. A Prakrit text
Gathasaptasati or Gathasattasai is attributed to a
Satvahana king Hala.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Asian Contact</i></strong></div>  

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Indo-Greeks</i></strong></div>  
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>With the decline of Mauryan empire a series of
invasions from Central Asia began around 200
B.C.</li>
        <li>The first to cross the Hindukush were the Indo
Greeks, who ruled Bactria.</li>
<li>Demetrius, the king of Bactria invaded India about
190 B.C. and arrested considerable part of Mauryan
dynasty in the north-west.</li>
<li>The most famous Indo-Greek ruler was Menander
(165-145 B.C.), who is said to have pushed forward
as far as Ayodhya and reached Pataliputra. His
capital was Sakala (Sialkot).</li>
<li>Menander, who was also known as Milinda,
was converted to Buddhism by famous scholar
Nagasena (Nagarjuna). The conversation between
the two is recorded in a book named Malindapanho
(Questions of Milinda).</li>
<li>The Greek introduced features of the Hellenistic art
in north-west part of India which is also known as
Gandhara art.</li>
<li>They also introduced practice of military
governorship. They appointed their governors
called Strategos.</li>
<li>The Greek ambassador called Heliodorous set up
a pillar in honour of Vishnu at Vidisha (Madhya
Pradesh).</li>
<li>The term Horshastra used for astrology in
Sanskrit had been derived from the Greek term
horoscope.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Sakas or Scythians (90 B.C.)</i></strong></div>
 <ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Greeks were followed by the Sakas, who
controlled much larger part of India than the
Greek did.</li>
<li>There were fi ve branches of the Sakas with their
seats of power in different parts of India and
Afghanistan.</li>
<li>They were full-fledged independent rulers.
Curiously enough called themselves Kshatraps, a
sankritised form of Persian Satrap or Governor.</li>
<li>The King of Ujjain in 58 B.C. is said to have defeated
the Saka and styled himself Vikramaditya. An era
called the Vikram Samyat is reckoned from the time
of his victory over the Sakas.</li>
<li>The most famous Saka ruler was Rudradaman I
(130-150 A.D.), who ruled in western India and
is famous for repairing the Sudarshan Lake in
Kathiawar, built during the regin of Chandragupta
Maurya. It is recorded in the first ever long
inscription in chaste Sanskrit in Junagadh which
was issued by Rudradaman and highlighted his
achievements.</li>
    </ul>
 </ol>


 <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Parthians</i></strong></div> 
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sakas were followed by Parthians. Special
interest is attached to Gondophernes, in whose
reign St. Thomas is said to have come to India to
propagate Christianity and converted him to his
faith.</li>
        <li>The Parthians originally lived in Iran and invaded
in the beginning of the Christian era, from where
they moved to India. In comparison to the Greeks
and Sakas they occupied only a small territory in
north-west India in the fi rst century.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Kushans</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Parthians were followed by the Kushanas who
were also called Yuchis or Tocharians.</li>
        <li>Wima Kadphises established the Kushana authority
as far as Varanasi in the east, credited for issuing a
large number of gold coins.</li>
        <li>Kanishka (78-144 A.D.) extended his empire from
Oxus to the eastern borders of U.P (Benaras) and
Bokhara in north to Ujjain in the south.</li>
        <li>He was a great patron of Buddhism and the 4th
Buddhist council is said to have been held under
his patronage.</li>
        <li>He patronised Asvaghosa, the writer of
Buddhacharita, the biography of Buddha and
Sutralankar and also patronised Charaka, the great
authority in Medical Science who wrote Sasruta
alongwith Nagarjuna who wrote Madhyamik
Sutra.</li>
<li>Purushpura (Peshawar) was the capital of
Kushanas. Mathura seemed to be their second
capital.</li>
<li>Kanishka controlled the famous 'silk route' in
Central Asia, which started from China and passed
through his empire in Central Asia and Afghanistan
to Iran and Western Asia which formed the part of
Roman empire.</li>
<li>Kanishka started an era known as Saka Era which
commenced from 78 A. D.</li>
<li>The Kushanas were the fi rst ruler in India to issue
gold coins on a wide scale with higher degree of
metallic purity than is found in the Gupta period.</li>
<li>The Gandhra school of art received the royal
patronage of Kushanas.</li>
<li>There is a Buddhist story which says that the King
of Pataliputra, unable to raise the large indemnity
imposed on him by Kanishka, surrendered to him
the alms-bowl of Buddha, the poet and philosopher
Ashvaghosha, and a marvelous cock.</li>
<li>According to a legend, the Buddhist philosopher
Ashvaghosha was especially invited from Oudh to
attend the fourth Buddhist Council for systematizing
and codifying Buddhist texts.</li>
<li>The fourth Buddhist Council was held under
the patronage of Kanishka at the Kundalavana
monastery in Kashmir, but there is another account,
which locates it in the Kuvana monastery at
Jallandhar.</li>
<li>According to Hiuen Tsang, the council was
summoned by Kanishka on the advice of the
venerable Parsva and he made Vasumitra its
President and Ashvaghosa its Vice-President.</li>
<li>This council prepared an encyclopedia of Buddhist
philosophy called the Mahavibhasha, which
survives in a Chinese translation. The language
employed was Sanskrit.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trade and Commerce</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Greek sailor Hippalus discovered monsoons
in the year 46-47 A.D. and this discovery proved a
boon for South Indian merchants as it accelerated
the trade activity of south India with the western
world.</li>
        <li>Manu's code, which is perhaps the most important
code of conduct of the Hindus, belongs to these
centuries of post-Mauryan phase only.</li>
        <li>The guild system was reaching its peak during
these centuries due to opening of many trade
routes for the merchants and also because of great
demand of Indian products in the western world
in these centuries. The kings also preferred to have
deal with the guild heads, as that would permit the
kings to have regular sources of income.</li>
        <li>India received a huge amount of gold due to its
Central Asian contacts that actually came from the
Altai Mountains.</li>
        <li>The control of the silk route by the Kushanas in
the first century of the Christian era was very
significant from the point of view of the increasing
prosperity of India in these centuries. Indian traders
took great advantage of the Kushana control over
the area through which the West Asia bound goods
had to go through.</li>
        <li>The Central Asians introduced better cavalry and
better technologies to be used by the Indians later.
As is evident from the contemporary sources, the
Sakas, Kushanas, etc. were excellent horsemen and
thus Indians were familiarized with the use of toe
stirrup, etc.</li>
<li>The Jain Prakrit text the Kalakacharya kathanak
states that the Saka kings used to be called Shahi.</li>
<li>In the period between 2nd centuries BC to 2nd
century A.D., craft working made great progress,
and so did cloth making, silk weaving, making of
arms, etc. Mathura was known for a special type
of cloth called sataka.</li>
<li>The Kushanas issued largest number of copper
coins in north and north-west India.</li>
<li>Most important town in this phase was Ujjain, as
it was at the nodal point of two most important
routes; one came from Koshambi and the other one
from Mathura.</li>
<li>Indo-Greeks were the fi rst to issue coins that can be
directly attributed to kings or dynasties as before
this the coins could not be attributed to any dynasty
with surety.</li>
<li>They were also the fi rst to issue gold coins in India
that increased in number during the period of the
Kushanas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Art and Culture</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The post Mauryan period is an epoch of great
sculptural achievements that marks the freedom
from the overpowering infl uence of the court in
the history of the Indian art.</li>
        <li>The reliefs on the gateways of the Stupa at Bharhut
were executed during the reign of the Sungas. Here,
the Bodhisattvas were represented in the human
forms according to the needs of the stories. But
Buddha is represented only in terms of the symbols
viz., Bodhi tree, the vajrayana, the footprints, the
wheel, the parasol, etc.</li>
        <li>At Sanchi, the human fi gures become much more
graceful and the power of the composition and the
narration is more advanced than at Bharhut.</li>
        <li>The Sanchi sculptures include the Jataka stories
and many historical themes like Bimbisara leaving</li>
        <li>Rajagriha to meet Buddha, or Ashoka's pilgrimage
to the Bodhi tree, etc.</li>
        <li>The Barhut stupa, Amravati stupas were created
during this phase. The stupa implied a place where
the relic associated with Buddha was kept.</li>
        <li>The purpose of the Hathi-gumpha inscription was
to record the construction of residential chamber
for Jaina ascetics on the top of the Udyagiri hills.</li>
<li>Semi-divine or divine status of the kings also
occurs in these centuries. Kushanas introduced this
practice.</li>
<li>Both Gandhara schools of art and the Mathura
school belong to this phase. The Gandhara art was
completely infl uenced by the Greek and Roman
styles while the Mathura art form had completely
indigenous origins.</li>
<li>The great period of the Mathura art also begins with
the Christian era, and its most prolifi c reached its
zenith under the Kushanas.</li>
<li>It is at Mathura that we for the fi rst time come across
making of images of the various Indian divinities.
The cult image gets introduced. It is the fi rst art
form in India that was quite dominant in its Indian
ethos unlike the Gandhara art, which had a lot of
influence from the Greeco-Roman features.</li>
<li>The central Asian contact introduced the use of
burnt bricks for fl ooring and that of tiles for both
flooring and roofing.</li>
<li>The Sakas and Kushans introduced turbans, tunics,
trousers, heavy long coats, caps, helmets and boots
used by warriors.</li>
<li>In the religious field, the Greek ambassador
Heliodorus set up a pillar in honour of Vasudeva near vidisa in M.P</li>
    </ul>
