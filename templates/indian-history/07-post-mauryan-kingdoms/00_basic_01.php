 The Sakas or Scythians (90 B.C.)
• The Greeks were followed by the Sakas, who
controlled much larger part of India than the
Greek did.
• There were fi ve branches of the Sakas with their
seats of power in different parts of India and
Afghanistan.
• They were full-fledged independent rulers.
Curiously enough called themselves Kshatraps, a
sankritised form of Persian Satrap or Governor.
• The King of Ujjain in 58 B.C. is said to have defeated
the Saka and styled himself Vikramaditya. An era
called the Vikram Samyat is reckoned from the time
of his victory over the Sakas.
• The most famous Saka ruler was Rudradaman I
(130-150 A.D.), who ruled in western India and
is famous for repairing the Sudarshan Lake in
Kathiawar, built during the regin of Chandragupta
Maurya. It is recorded in the first ever long
inscription in chaste Sanskrit in Junagadh which
was issued by Rudradaman and highlighted his
achievements.
The Parthians
• The Sakas were followed by Parthians. Special
interest is attached to Gondophernes, in whose
reign St. Thomas is said to have come to India to
propagate Christianity and converted him to his
faith.
• The Parthians originally lived in Iran and invaded
in the beginning of the Christian era, from where
they moved to India. In comparison to the Greeks
and Sakas they occupied only a small territory in
north-west India in the fi rst century.
The Kushans
• The Parthians were followed by the Kushanas who
were also called Yuchis or Tocharians.
• Wima Kadphises established the Kushana authority
as far as Varanasi in the east, credited for issuing a
large number of gold coins.
• Kanishka (78-144 A.D.) extended his empire from
Oxus to the eastern borders of U.P (Benaras) and
Bokhara in north to Ujjain in the south.
• He was a great patron of Buddhism and the 4th
Buddhist council is said to have been held under
his patronage.
• He patronised Asvaghosa, the writer of
Buddhacharita, the biography of Buddha and
Sutralankar and also patronised Charaka, the great
authority in Medical Science who wrote Sasruta
alongwith Nagarjuna who wrote Madhyamik
Sutra.
