<h3>Early History of South India</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Megalithic Culture and the
Pre-Sangam Era</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Neolithic-Chalcolithic amalgam which seems
to have been round about 2000 B.C. continued upto
about the middle of the fi rst millennium B.C.</li>
<li>It was then overlapped by the Megalithic culture
inhabited by the megaliths builder. They are known
not from their actual settlement which is rare but
from their graves, these are called megaliths because
they were encircled by big pieces of stones.</li>
<li>About the beginning of the Christian era the
Megalith culture in South India was overlapped by
what has been called 'Andhra culture' on account
of the occurrence of Andhra coins.</li>
<li>This is the time when south India had a large
volume of trade with Roman world.</li>
<li>Again the culture and economic contacts between
the north and the south paved the way for
the introduction of material culture brought
from the north to the Deep South by traders,
conquerors, Jainas, Buddhist and some Brahaman
missionaries.</li>
<li>The Vindhya Range was recognized as the southern
limit of the Aryan land. Manu states distinctly
that the country between the Himalayas and the
Vindhyas and between the eastern and western
oceans comprised Aryavarta, the abode of the
Aryans.</li>
<li>The Suttanipatta of the Buddhist canon records
that teacher Bavari left Kosala and settled in a
village on the Godavari in the Assaka country in
Dakshinapatha.</li>
<li>His pupils are said to have gone north to meet
Buddha and their route lay through Patitthana
(Paithan) in the Mulaka country, Mahishmati
(Mandhata) on the Narmada, and Ujjain. Bavari
is said to have been learned in the Vedas and
performed Vedic sacrifices.His pupils are said to have gone north to meet

is said to have been learned in the Vedas and
performed Vedic sacrifices.</li>
<li>Kautilya speaks of the pearls and muslims of
the Pandyan country. The name of the Pandyan
capital Madura recalls Mathura of the North,
and Greek accounts, as we have seen, narrate the
story of Herakles (in the context, Krishna) setting
his daughter Pandaia to rule over the kingdom
bordering on the southern sea.</li>
<li>In the Mahabharata, the story of Rishi Agastya’s
connection with South India comes into
prominence</li>
<li> In later Tamil tradition, Agastya’s southerly march
is accounted for by the interesting legend that on
the occasion of Shiva’s marriage with Paravati,
Agastya had to be sent to the South to redress
the balance of the earth which had been rudely
disturbed by the assemblage of all the gods and
sages in the North.</li>
<li>In the Ramayana, as they are on their way
to Agastya’s ashrama, Rama tells his brother
Lakshmana how Agastya intent upon the good of
the world, overpowered deadly demon, thereby
rendered the earth habitable.</li>
<li>A beam of Indian cedar found in the place of
Nebuchadnezzar (604-562 B.C.), the teak logs
found in the temple of the Moon God at Ur at levels
belonging to about the same age or a little later, and
the Baveru Jataka which relates the adventures of
certain Indian merchants who took the fi rst peacock
by sea to Babylon, all confi rm the existence of active
maritime intercourse between South India and its
western neighbours.</li>
<li>The Assyrian and Babylonian empires traded with
India by sea from their ports on the Persian Gulf
and continued to receive gold, spices and fragrant
woods from India.</li>
<li>In Chinese history, there are many references to
maritime traders bringing typical Indian products
to China as far back as the seventh century B.C.</li>
<li>The Arthashastra of Kautilya gives some information
of value about the trade between the North and the
South in the age of the early Mauryan Empire.</li>
<li>The kingdoms of South India, together with Ceylon,
are mentioned in the second and thirteenth rock
edicts of Ashoka. The list in the second edict is the
more complete and includes the names of Chola,
Pandya, Satiyaputa, Keralputa and Tambapanni
(Ceylon).</li>
<li>The short Damili inscriptions found in the natural
rock caverns of the South have many features in
common with the similar but more numerous
records of Sri Lanka and are among the earliest
monuments of the Tamil country to which we may
assign a date with some confidence.</li>
<li>The stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana 
were well-known to the Tamil poets, and episodes
from them are frequently mentioned.</li>
<li>The Tolkappiyam states that marriage as a
sacrament attended with ritual was established in
the Tamil country by the Aryans.</li>

        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chera Kingdom</i></strong></div>  



The monarchies of the Cheras, the Cholas and
the Pandyas were believed, at least in subsequent
ages, to be of immemorial antiquity, and the poems
of the Sangam attest the anxiety of all of them to
connect themselves with the events of the Great War
between the Kauravas and the Pandavas. The fi rst
Chera monarch we hear of is Udiyanjeral (AD 130)
who is said to have fed sumptuously both the armies
of Kurukshetra, and thereby earned for himself the
title ‘Udiyanjeral of the great feeding’.
The son of Udiyanjeral was Nedunjeral Adan who
won a naval victory against some local enemy on the
Malabar cost, and took captive several Yavana traders whom for some time he subjected to harsh treatment, for reasons that are not clear, but subsequently
released after obtaining a heavy ransom. He is said
to have fought many wars and spent many years in
camp with his armies. He won victories against seven
crowned kings, and thus reached the superior rank of
an Adhiraja. He was called Imayavramban –‘He who
had the Himalaya for his boundary’- a title explained
by the claim that he conquered all India and carved
the Chera emblem of the bow on the face of the
great mountain- an instance of poetic exaggeration
not uncommon in these poems. His capital is called
Marandai. He fought a war with the contemporary
Chola king in which both the monarchs lost their
lives and their queens performed Sati.
Adan’s younger brother was ‘Kuttuvan of many
elephants’ who conquered Kongu and apparently
extended the Chera power from the Western to the
Eastern sea for a time. Adan had two sons by different queens. One of them was known as ‘the Chera
with the Kalangay festoon and the fi bre crown’, the
crown he wore at his coronation is said to have
been made of Palmyra fi bre and the festoon on it
contained Kalangay, a small black berry. It was not
altogether to be despised for the crown had a golden
frame and festoons of precious pearls, but why the
king had to wear such an extraordinary tiara is not
explained anywhere. He is said to have won successes
against the contemporary Adigaiman chieftain Anji
of Tagaddur and to have led an expedition against
Nannan whose territory lay to the North of Malabar,
in the Tulu country. He too was an Adhiraja wearing
a garland of seven crowns.
<br>
The other son of Adan was Senguttuvan, ‘the
Righteous Kuttuva’ (c.180), celebrated in song by
Paranar, one of the most famous and longest lived
poets of the Sangam Age. Senguttuvan’s life and
achievements have been embellished by legends of
a later time of which there are no traces in the two
strictly contemporary poems, both by Paranar - the
decade on the king in the ‘Ten Tens’, and a song in
the Purananuru. The only material achievement they
celebrate is a victorious war against the chieftain of
Mohur. Paranar also says that Senguttuvan exerted
himself greatly on the sea, but gives no details. He
was given a title for driving back the sea, and this is
taken to mean that he destroyed the effi ciency of the
sea as a protection to his enemies who relied on it. If
this is correct, he must have maintained a fl eet. For
the rest, we only learn that he was a skilled rider on
horse and elephant, wore a garland of seven crowns
as Adhiraja, and was adept in besieging fortresses,
besides being a great warrior and a liberal patron
of the arts.
<br>
The epilogue to the decade adds a number of
new articulars, the most important bearing on the
establishment of the Pattini Cult, i.e., the worship
of Kannagi as the ideal wife. The stone for making
the image of Pattini, the Divine chaste wife, was
obtained after a fi ght with an Aryan chieftain and
bathed in the Ganges before being brought to the
Chera country. All these events are narrated with
numerous embellishments and in epic detail in the
Silappadikaram, though whether this poem derives
from the epilogue to decade, or the epilogue from
the epic, is more than we can say. The antiquity and
popularity of the story of Kannagi and Kovalan and
the probable existence of other and earlier versions of
the Kannagisaga which preceded the Silappadikaram
are fairly well-attested, and it is not unlikely that
Senguttuvan took the lead in organizing the cult of
Pattini, and was supported in his effort by the contemporary rulers of the Pandya and Chola countries
and of Ceylon as the Silappadikaram says.
Altogether fi ve monarchs of the line of Udiyanjeral
belonging to three generations are mentioned in the
Padirruppattu, the number of years they are said to
have ruled totals 201, while another three monarchs
of the collateral line are said to have reigned for a
further 58 years in all. Their reigns surely cannot have
been successive, and we must therefore postulate a
very considerable degree of overlapping. The Chera
Kingdom must have been a sort of family estate
in which all the grown-up males had a share and
interest what Kautilya calls kula-sangha, a family
group, and considers a very effi cient form of state
organization.
<br>
A similar clan-rule might also have prevailed in
Chola and Pandya kingdoms in this period. Such an
assumption for the Cholas would be the best means
of explaining Senguttuvan’s interference in a war of
succession in which nine Chola princes lost their lives,
it would also furnish a natural explanation for the
occurrence in the Sangam poems of so many royal
names, all to be accommodated within four or fi ve
generations.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contemporary Chera Rulers</i></strong></div>  

The heroes of the last three decades of the ‘Ten
Tens’ and their ancestors must be taken to have ruled
contemporaneously with the kings of the house of
Udiyanjeral. The fi rst to be heard of among them
are Anduvan and his son Selvakkadungo Vali Adan,
both praised by the poets in general terms for their
valour and liberality, the father is said to have been a
well-read scholar and the son performed many Vedic
sacrifi ces. Famous among the minor chieftains who
were their contemporaries were Ay and Pari, both
celebrated in several poems by a number of poets.
Ay was the patron of a Brahmin poet from Uraiyur,
and Pari befriended and patronized another Brahmin,
Kapilar, who repaired to the Chera court only after
Pari’s death. There he was welcomed by Anduvan’s
son whom he praised in the seventh decade of the
‘Ten of Tens’.
Ay was one of the many Vel chieftains ruling in
several parts of the Tamil country. The Vels claimed
to have issued from the sacrifi cial fi re pit legends
of their connection with Vishnu and Agastya, and
of one of their ancestors having shot down a tiger
which was about to attack a sage in the midst of his
penance legends, very similar to those of the Hoysalas
in later times.
<br>
The country he ruled lay round about the Podiya
hill, the Southernmost section of the Western Ghats,
and the Greek geographer Ptolemy says that one
‘Aioi’ was ruling in the country which included Cape
Comorin and Mount Bettigo. Ay seems to have been
a dynastic name borne by all the kings of the line as
a prefi x to their personal names. The patron of the
Brahmin poet of Uraiyur was also called Andiran, a
Sanskrit word meaning hero. His country is described
as fertile and teeming with elephants, which he presented liberally to his cloth of very fi ne texture given
to him by a Naga chieftain Nila.
Andiran seems to have been a man of peace, while
the excellence of his country and his liberality from
the theme of a large number of poems, there is only
one casual reference to his success in the battlefi eld
when he is said to have once pursued the Kongar to
the Western Sea. On his death, the poet says, Andiran
was welcomed in the abode of the gods and the drum
in Indira’s palace reverberated at his arrival.
Pari, the life long friend and patron of Kapilar,
was another Vel chieftain also noted for heroism and
generosity. His principality lay in the Pandya country
round the hillock known as Kodungunram or Piranmalai. The fame of Pari’s liberality was echoed in a
later age in the Shaiva saint Sundarmurti’s lament:
‘there is no one ready to give, even if an illiberal
patron is exalted in song to the level of Pari’. Pari’s
country is said to have comprised three hundred
villages round the fortifi ed hill at the centre.
The fertility of the land, the strength of the hill,
and the ruler’s liberality are praised in many charming poems, not only by Kapilar. Kapilar stood by Pari
through thick and thin when his hillock was closely
intercepted by the three crowned kings of the Tamil
land. Kapilar’s intelligence went far to aid Pari’s
heroism in prolonging the resistance, for instance,
several other poets say that Kapilar trained a large
number of birds (parrots according to one) to fl y out
from Pari’s beleaguered fortress into the open country
behind the enemy’s lines and bring in corn to feed
the city and the army for several months! But the
inevitable end came, and in a short poem Pari’s two
daughters thus bewailed the occurrence: ‘in those
days we enjoyed the moonlight happily with father,
and our enemies could not take our hill. Now, this
day, in this bright moonlight, kings with victorious
war-drums have captured the hill, and we have lost
our father.’ The reference to the victorious drum is
ironical, as Pari was not killed in open fi ght but by
treachery.
<br>
After Pari’s death, Kapilar took charge of his
two unmarried daughters and tried without success
to get them suitably married. Of what happened
subsequently there are different accounts. A note
at the end of one of the poems in the Purananuru
records that Kapilar, after the death of Pari, left his
daughters in the charge of Brahmins and committed
suicide by starvation. The tradition recorded in a
Chola inscription of the eleventh century, however,
is very different, it mentions only one daughter who
Kapilar had given in marriage to the Malaiyaman
before the former entered the fi re to attain heaven.
And there exist many songs by Kapilar on Malaiyaman Tirumudikkari of Mullur, the excellence and easy
defensibility of his country, and his liberal patronage
of poets and minstrels.
Whatever may be the truth about the marriage
of Pari’s daughter or daughters, it is certain that
Kapilar neither committed suicide by starvation nor
by entering fi re soon after the death of his friend
and patron. In fact, he repaired to the court of the
Chera Prince Selvakkadungo Vali Adan, the son of
Anduvan, because he was reputed to possess all the
great qualities of Pari. Kapilar celebrated Adan in song
and was sumptuously rewarded for his effort.
Adan’s son was Perunjeral Irumporai (c. 190)
renowned for his overthrow of the stronghold of 
Tagadur (Dharmapuri in Salem District), the seat
of the power of the Adigaiman chieftains. He is
also said to have subjugated a rebellious shepherd
leader named Kaluvul and captured his fortress. He
was learned, performed many sacrifi ces and begot
heroic sons worthy of succeeding him. His wise and
righteous conduct was such as to induce his Purohit
to renounce the things of the world and retire to a
life of asceticism.
<br>
Adigaiman, also called Neduman Anji, the opponent of Irumporai and Lord of Tagadur, was one of
the ‘seven patrons’ and the supporter of the celebrated
poetess Auvaiyar who has left many songs about him
and some about his son Pogutteline. Evidently patron
and poetess did not get on well at fi rst start, for one
poem gives expression to Auvaiyar’s vexation at having waited a long time for a present. Soon, however,
a perfect understanding grew up between them, the
poetess is all praise for the hero and his achievements
in the fi eld, and undertakes a diplomatic mission to
the Tondaiman on his account.
On his side, Anji showed his devotion by many
valuable presents, including a rare myrobalan fruit
believed to prevent the ailments of old age and to
assure longevity. According to Auvaiyar, Adigaiman
was born of a family, which honoured the gods by
puja and by sacrifi ces, which introduced into the
world the sweet sugarcane from heaven, and ruled
the world with great ability for a very long time.
Adigaiman fought with success against seven opposing princes and destroyed amongst other rebellious
strongholds that of Kovalur. The Chera invasion of
Tagadur, however, is not mentioned by Auvaiyar
in her poems, evidently because she did not like to
advert to the misfortunes that befell her patron, the
event formed the theme of a poem of later times, the
Tagadur Yattirai, now known only from quotation in
other works. Adigaiman was aided by the Pandya
and Chola monarchs against the Chera, but their
help made no difference to the result. The war led
to Adiaman’s acknowledgement of the suzerainty of
the Chera on whose behalf he subsequently led an
expedition against Pali, the capital of Nannan, where,
after infl icting great losses on Nannan, known as
Nimili or Minili. Auvaiyar laments his death without
mentioning its occasion, and bewails the desolation of
the days that remained to her after Adigaiman had
earned his title to a hero-stone, a clear statement that
he fell on the battlefield.
<br>
The last Chera prince mentioned in the extent portions of the ‘Ten Tens’ is Kudakko Ilanjeral Irumporai
(c. A.D. 190), a cousin of the victor of Tagadur. He is
said to have fought a battle against ‘the two big kings’
(Pandya and Chola) and Vicci, to have captured fi ve
stone fortresses, to have defeated the big Chola who
ruled at Potti and the Young Palaiyan Maran, and to
have brought to the ancient city of Vanji much booty
from these campaigns.
The mention of the Vani River fl owing near the
Chera capital shows that Karuvur was in fact Vanji.
The discovery of Chera inscriptions near Karur, and
of thousands of Roman coins in Karur and its neighbourhood and Ptolemy’s statement that the inland
city of Korura was the Chera capital also point to
the same conclusion. The recent arch aeological excavations at this site, especially the fi nd of Roman
amphorae pieces conclusively prove the identity of
modern Karur with the Vanji of the Sangam Age.
The attempts to locate it in at Tiruvanjaikkalam in
Kerala may now be discarded.
Another Chera prince deserving mention is ‘Sey
of the elephant look’ who had also the title Mandaranjeral Irumporai (c. A.D. 210). After one battle, he
was captured by his contemporary Pandya ruler
Nedunjeliya, the victor of Talaiyalanganam, but regained his freedom in time to prevent his enemies
at home from deposing him.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chola Rulers</i></strong></div>  
       
Among the Cholas, Karikala ( A.D. 190) stands
out pre-eminent. He is described in a poem as the
descendant of a king (not named) who compelled
the wind to serve his purposes when he sailed his
ships on the wide ocean-possibly a reference to the
early maritime enterprise of the Cholas. Karikala’s
father was Ilanjetceni ‘of many beautiful chariots’, a
brave king and a hard fi ghter. Karikala means ‘the
man with the charred leg’, a reference to an accident
by fire, which befell the prince early in life. Other
explanations for the name were invented in later
times, however, and it has also been taken to be a
compound word in Sanskrit meaning either ‘death
to kali’ or ‘death to (enemy) elephant’. Early in life
he was deposed and imprisoned.
<br>
The plucky war in which Karikala escaped and
re-established himself on the throne is well portrayed
by the author of Pattinappalai, a long poem on the
Chola capital Kaveri-Pattinam, in the Pattuppattu (Ten
Idylls). One of his early achievements was the victory
in a great battle at Venni, modern Kovil Venni, 15
miles to the east of Tanjore. This battle is referred to in
many poems by different authors. Eleven rulers, velir
and kings, lost their drums in the field, the Pandya
and the Chera lost their glory. The Pandyan ruler was
wounded severely on his back which was the greatest
humiliation for a warrior, and from a sense of profound shame he sat facing the north, sword in hand,
and starved himself to death. Venni, thus, marked a
turning point in the career of Karikala. His victory
meant the breaking up of a widespread confederacy
that had been formed against him. Another important
battle he fought was at Vahaip- parandalai, ‘the field 
of vahai trees’, where nine minor enemy chieftains
lost their umbrellas and had to submit.
As a result of his victorious campaigns, says the
poet of Pattinappalai ‘the numerous Oliyar submitted
to him, the ancient Aruvalar carried out his behests,
the Northerners lost splendour, and the Westerners
were depressed conscious of the might of his large
army ready to shatter the fortresses of enemy kings,
Karikala turned his fl ushed look of anger against the
Pandya, whose strength gave way the line of low
herdsmen, was brought to an end, and the family
of Irungovel was uprooted’.
<br>
The Aruvalar were the people of Aruvanad, the
lower valley of the Pennar, to the North of the Kaveri
delta. Karikala is said to have prevented the migration
of people from his land to other regions evidently by
offering them inducements to stay.
Karikala’s wars thus resulted in his establishing a
sort of hegemony among the ‘crowned kings’ of the
Tamil country and in some extension of the territory
under his direct rule. The description of Kaveri-pattinam and its foreshore, which takes up so much of
the Pattinappalai, gives a vivid idea of the state of
industry and commerce at this time. Karikala also
promoted the reclamation and settlement of forestland, and added to the prosperity of the country by
multiplying its irrigation tanks. The poems also bear
evidence that the king, who was a follower of the
Vedic religion, performed sacrifi ces and lived well,
enjoying life to the full.
In later times, Karikala became the centre of
many legends found in the Silappadikaram and
in inscriptions and literary works of the eleventh
and twelfth centuries. They attribute to him the
conquest of whole of India upto the Himalayas and
the construction with the aid of his feudatories of
the fl ood banks of the Kaveri. The famous scholar
Naccinarkkiniyar, probably follows a correct tradition when he says that Karikala married a Velier
girl from Nangur, a place celebrated in the hymns
of Tirumnagai Alvar for the heroism of its warriors.
More open to suspicion is the story in the Silappadikaram about a supposed daughter of Karikala’s,
named Adi Mandi, and her husband, a Chera prince
called Attan Atti. Earlier poems which mention their
names and some of the incidents attest only the
relation between Adi Mandi and Atti, but not that
between her and Karikala, nor the Chera descent of
Atti. Both husband and wife were, according to the
early testimony, professional dancers.
Tondaiman Ilandiraiyan, who ruled at Kanchipuram was a contemporary of Karikala and is also
celebrated by the poet of the Pattinappalai in another
poem in the ‘Ten Idylls’. Ilandiraiyan is said to have
been a descendant of Vishnu and belonged to the
family of Tiraiyar given by the waves of the sea.
There is no hint anywhere of his being related to
Karikala or of his political subordination to the Chola
power. Nor is it clear whether it was to him or to
some other member of his line that Auviaiyar went
as Adigaiman’s ambassador. Ilandiraiyan was himself
a poet, and there are four extant songs by him, one
of them on the importance of the personal character
of the monarch in the promotion of good rule.
<br>
This understanding of the political conditions
of the Sangam age may not be closed without the
mention of two other Chola rulers, both opponents
of the Cheras in war. One was Ilanjetceni of Neydalanganal who captured two fortresses from the Cheras known by the names of Seruppali and Pamalur.
Another was Senganan, the Chola monarch famed
in legend for his devotion to Shiva, fi gures as the
victor in the battle of Por against the Chera Kanaikkal Irumporai. The Chera was taken prisoner, asked
for drinking water when he was in prison, got it
rather late, and then, without drinking it, confessed
the shame of his position in a song. Subsequently,
Poyagaiyar, a friend of the Chera monarch, is said
to have secured his release from the Chola prisons
by celebrating the victory of Senganan in a poem of
forty stanzas the Kalavali. According to this poem,
the battle was fought at Kalumalam, near Karuvur,
the Chera capital. Senganan became the subject of
many pious legends in later times. It is possible that
this monarch who, according to Tirumangai, built 70
fi ne temples of Shiva, lived somewhat later, say in
the fourth or fi fth century A.D.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i> Pandyan Kings</i></strong></div>  
       
The Pandya king Nedunjeliyan distinguished by
the title ‘he who won the battle at Talaiyalanganam’
may be taken to have ruled about A.D. 210. This
ruler was celebrated by two great poets Mangudi
Marudan alias Mangudi Kilar and Nakkirar, each
contributing a poem on the monarch to the ‘Ten Idylls’
(Pattuppattu) besides minor pieces in the Puram and
Abham collections.
From the Maduraikkanji of Mangudi Marudan
and elsewhere, we learn something of three of
Nedunjeliyan’s predecessors on the Pandyan throne.
The fi rst is an almost mythical fi gure called Nediyon
(‘the tall one’), whose achievements fi nd a place in
the ‘Sacred Sports’ of Shiva at Madura and among the
traditions of the Pandyas enumerated in the Velvikudi
and Sinnamanur plates. He is said to have brought
the Pahruli River into existence and organized the
worship of the sea.
<br>
The next is Palsalai Mudukuduni, doubtless the
same as the earliest Pandya king named in the Velvikudi grant and about whom there are several poems.
He is a more life like fi gure than Nediyon, and is
said to have treated conquered territory harshly. He
also performed many sacrifi ces, whence he derived
his title Palsalai meaning ‘of the many (sacrifi cial)
halls’. It is not possible to say what distance in time
separated these two kings from each other or from
their successors.
The third ruler mentioned in the Madduraikkanji
was another Nedunjeliyan, distinguished by the title
‘he who won a victory against an Aryan (i.e., North
Indian) army’. The tragedy of Kovalan’s death at
Madura occurred in his reign, which according to
the Silappadi-karam caused the king to die of a
broken heart. A short poem ascribed to this king
puts learning above birth and caste.
Nedunjeliyan of Talaiyalangam came to the throne
as a youth and soon after his accession, he proved
himself more than equal to a hostile combination
of his two neighbouring monarchs and fi ve minor
chieftains. There exists a simple poem of great force
and beauty in which the youthful monarch swears
an oath of heroism and victory in the ensuing fi ght.
Despising his tender years and hoping for an easy
victory and large boot, his enemies invaded the kingdom and penetrated to the heart of it, but, nothing
daunted, Nedunjeliyan readily took the fi eld, pursued
the invading forces across his frontier into the Chola
country and infl icted a crushing defeat on them at
Talaiya-langanam, about eight miles North- West of
Tiruvalur in theTanjore district. It was in this battle
that the Chera king ‘Sey of the elephant eye’ was
taken captive and thrown into a Pandyan prison. By
his victory Nedunjeliyan not only made himself secure
on his ancestral throne, but also gained a primacy
over the entire state system of the Tamil country. He
also conquered the two divisions (Kurram) of Milalai
and Mutturu from Evvi and a Velier chieftain and
annexed them to his kingdom.
The Madduraikkanji contains a full-length description of Madura and the Pandyan country under
Nedunjeliyan’s rule. The poet gives expression to
his wish that his patron should spread the benefi ts
of his good rule all over India. He makes particular
mention of the farmers and traders of a place called
Muduvellilai (unidentifi ed) as among his most loyal
subjects for many generations. He also refers to the
battle of Alanganam, calls his patron Lord of Korkai
and the warlord of the Southern Paradavar hinting
that the people of the pearl- fi shery coast formed an
important section of his army.
<br>
Passing over the many contemporaries of Nedunjeliyan-Pandya and Chola princes and the poets
who mention them and their achievements, we must
now notice a rather protracted civil war in the Chola
kingdom mentioned by Kovur Kilar and other poets.
This war was between Nalangilli (also called Sectcenni)
and Nedungilli. The latter shut himself up at Avur,
which was being besieged by Mavalattan, the younger
brother of Nalangilli. In one poem, Kovur Kilar says
that if he claimed to be virtuous, Nedungilli should
open the gates of the fort or if he claimed to be brave,
he should come into the open and fi ght. He did neither, but caused untold misery to the people of his
beleagured city by shuting himself up in a coward
manner. Another poem dealing with the siege of
Uraiyur by Nalangilli himself, once more Nedungilli
being the besieged, is more considerate and impartial,
it is addressed to both princes and exhorts them to
stop the destructive war, as whoever loses would
be a Chola, and a war to the fi nish must necessarily
end in the defeat of one party. A third poem relates
to a somewhat piquant situation.
A poet, Ilandattan by name, who went into Uraiyur from Nalangilli, was suspected by Nedungilli of
spying. As he was about to be killed, Kovur Kilar
interceded with his song on the harmless and upright nature of poets and thus saved him. Another
poem hints at internal dissensions in the royal family
at Uraiyur, which induced Nalangilli’s soldiers to
rush to war in utter disregard of women. Civil war
seems, indeed, to have been the bane of the Chola
kingdom in this age: Senguttuvan, as we have seen,
was called upon to intervene in another war at an
earlier time.
<br>
A thorough change in the political map of South
India and the defi nite close of an epoch seem to be
clearly implied in the Sirupan-arruppadai by Nattattanar, one of the Pattupattu (‘Ten Idylls’). The poem
has Nalliyakkodan for its hero and he may be taken
to stand right a territory, which included Gidangil,
a village near Tindivanam. We may assign to him
a date about A.D. 275, and in his day the poet says
that charity had dried up in the capitals of the three
Tamil kingdoms, and all ancient patrons of learning and the arts were no more! There may well be
some exaggeration here, but clearly Vanji, Uraiyur
and Madura must have passed the meridian of their
prosperity and entered on a period of decline.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sangam Polity</i></strong></div>  

<b>Hereditary Monarchy:</b> Hereditary monarchy was
the prevailing form of government. Disputed successions and civil wars were not unknown, as we
have seen, and sometimes caused grave misery to
the people. The king was in all essential respects an
autocrat whose autocracy, however, was tempered by
the maxims of the wise and the occasional intercession
of a minister, a poet or a friend. The sphere of the
state’s activity was, however, limited, and in a society where respect for custom was deep-rooted, even
the most perverse of autocrats could not have done
much harm, indeed it must be said that the general
impression left on the mind by the literature of the
age is one of containment of the part of the people 
who were proud of their kings and loyal to them.
As the people took the king for their model, it
was his duty to set up a high moral standard by his
personal conduct. In many poems he was exhorted
to keep a strict mastery over his passions in order to
rule successfully. He was to be liberal in his patronage of religion, arts, and letters. He was to show
paternal care for his subjects and to be impartial as
among different sections of them. He held a daily
durbar (nalavai) at which he heard and set right all
complaints. The onerous character of the royal task
is emphasized by a poet who compares a king to a
strong bull, which drags a cart laden with salt from
the plains to the uplands, another affi rms that the
king, much more than rice or water, is the life of
the people.
<br>
Brahmins were assigned an important role in the
state. They were the foremost among those (surram)
on whose assistance the king relied in his daily work,
and the highest praise of a monarch was to say that he
did nothing, which pained the Brahmins. Agriculture
was the mainstay of polity and the basis of war, and
a good king was believed to be able to command the
course of the seasons. The ideal of the ‘conquering
king’ (vijigishu) was accepted and acted on. Victory
against seven kings meant a superior status, which
the victor marked by wearing a garland made out of
the crowns of the seven vanquished rulers.
The most powerful kings were expected to undertake a digvijaya, which was a conquering expedition
in a clockwise direction over the whole of India. The
idea of a Chakravarti, ‘wheel-king’, whose digvijaya
was led by the march of a mysterious wheel of gold
and gems through the air, is mentioned in one of
the poems in the Purananuru. Another poem in the
same collection mentions the companions of a king
who committed suicide when the king died-an early
anticipation of what later became a widespread institution under such names as Companions of Honour
(Abu Zayd), velaikkarar, garudas, sahavasis, apattudavigal and so on.
General Administration: The Sabha or Manram of
the king in the capital was the highest court of justice.
The sons of Malaiyaman were tried and sentenced,
and later released by the intercession of Kovur Kilar,
in the Manram of Uraiyur, and Pottiyar, after the
death of his friend Kopperunjolan, could not bear the
sight of the same Manram bereft of him. The elders
were doubtless expected to have laid aside their
personal quarrels when they attended the sabha to
help in the adjudication of disputes. We may infer
that the assembly was used by the king for purposes
of general consultation as well. The Kural, clearly a
post Sangam work, defi nitely regards the Sabha as a
general assembly dealing with all affairs. Even less
specialized, and more entangled in the social and
religious complex of village life was the Manram.
Each village had its common place of meeting,
generally under the shade of a big tree, where men,
women and children met for all the common activities
of the village, including sports and pastimes. There
may also have been a political side to these rural
gatherings, the germ out of which grew the highly
organized system of village government, which functioned, so admirably in later Chola times.
<br>
<b>Revenue System:</b> Land and trade were the chief
sources of the royal revenue. The Ma and Veli as
measures of land were already known. Foreign
trade was important and customs revenue occupied
a high place on the receipts side of the budget. The
Pattinappalai gives a vivid account of the activity of
customs offi cials in Puhar (Kaveri-Pattinam). Internal
transit duties on merchandise moving from place to
place were another source of revenue, and the roads
were guarded night and day by soldiers to prevent
smuggling. Moderation in taxation, however, was
impressed on the rulers by many wise saying of the
poets. If their word may be trusted, booty captured
in war was no inconsiderable part of royal resources.
The king’s share of the produce of agriculture is
nowhere precisely stated.
<br>
<b>War Policy:</b> The streets of the capital cities were
patrolled at nights by watchmen bearing torches, and
the prison formed part of the system of administration. Each ruler maintained an army of well-equipped
professional soldiers who no doubt found frequent
employment in those bellicose times. Captains of the
army were distinguished by the title of Enadi conferred at a formal ceremony of investiture where the
king presented the chosen commander with a ring
and other insignia of high military rank.
The army comprised the traditional four armschariots (drawn by oxen), elephants, cavalry and
infantry. Swords, bows and arrows, armour made
of tiger skins, javelins, spears and shields (including
a protective cover for the forearm) are among the
weapons of offence and defence specifi cally mentioned. The drum and the conch were employed on
the fi eld for signaling and the former to summon
soldiers to arms. Each ruler and chieftain certainly
had a war drum among his insignia. Not only was it
carefully guarded, but also it was bathed periodically
and worshipped with loud mantras. The occasions
for war were numerous, but we need not suppose
that the refusal of one king to give his daughter in
marriage to another was as a frequent cause of the
war as capturing enemy’s cattle. Brahmin messenger might be sent with a formal declaration before
hostilities started.
<br>
The military camp was often an elaborate affair,
with streets and roads and a separate section for the
king guarded by armed women. In this camp the hours
of day and night were announced by watchers of water
clocks, the gnomon was employed to indicate midday
and a drum beaten early morning. Campfi res kept
off the cold when necessary, and there were towers
at important points from which a regular watch was
maintained against surprise from the enemy.
Death in battle was welcome to the soldier and
even to his mother, for it was held to lead him straight
to heaven. To the warrior, a peaceful death in bed
was looked upon as a disgrace, and in the families
of ruling chieftains the body of a man who died otherwise than in war was cut with the sword, and laid
on darbha grass, and mantras were chanted to secure
him a place in the warriors, heaven (virasvarga).
Soldiers who fell in war were commemorated by
hero-stone which bore inscriptions detailing their
names and achievement, these stones were often
worshipped as godlings. Wounded soldiers were
carefully attended to, their wounds being cleaned
and stitched where necessary.
<br>
Kings often took the fi eld in person and delighted
to rejoice with the common soldiers in their successes.
On the other hand, if a king was killed or even seriously wounded in the midst of the fi ght, his army
gave up the struggle and accepted defeat. The vanity
of the victor often infl icted deep personal humiliations
on his vanquished foe, the memory of which rankled
and brought on further strife. The crown of defeated
kings furnished the gold for the anklets of the victor,
while a woman’s anklet and a garment of leaves were
forced on the defeated party who was compelled to
wear them, his guardian tree was destroyed and its
trunk converted into a war-drum for the victor. The
conquered country was at times ruthlessly laid waste,
even cornfi elds not being spared.
The Kalavali is one of the most detailed descriptions
we possess of a battlefi eld in the Tamil country, and
the poem supplies in a casual way much interesting
information of military affairs. The soldiers, infantry and cavalry alike wore leather sandals for the
protection of their feet. The nobles and princes rode
on elephants, and the commanders drove in pennon
chariots. The poet says that women whose husbands
were killed bewailed their loss on the fi eld of Kalumalam, unless this is more rhetoric, we must suppose
that women, at least of the higher orders, sometimes
accompanied their husbands to the fields.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Society & Economy</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
            
        <b>Cultural Fusion :</b> The most striking feature of this
age was its composite character, it is the unmistakable
result of the blend of two originally distinct cultures,
best described as Tamilian and Aryan, but it is by no
means easy now to distinguish the original elements
in their purity. Some of them may be recognized,
however, to have clearly originated in Northern India and made their way into the South during the
period of its Aryanization and later.
It is doubtless that there was a profound fusion
or cultural synthesis between the Sanskritic culture
of the North and the Tamil Culture of the South
in this period. The contemporary literature affords
unmistakable evidence of the friendliest reception
accorded in the Tamil country to the rich and varied culture of the North. The fertility of the lands
watered by the river Cauvery is a recurring theme
in the Tamil poetry.
The literary text ‘Purananooru’ retains the trace
of the society before it was Aryanized. It says that
there were no other Kudis (Tribes) than the four viz.,
Tudiyan, Panan, Paraiyan and Kadamban, and no God
worthy of worship with the offering of paddy.
The stories of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana
were well-known to the Tamil poets and episodes
from them are frequently mentioned. The claim of
each of the three Tamil kings to feed the opposing
forces on the eve of the Great Battle has been noted
already. The destruction of the three metallic forts of
the Asuras (Tripura) by Shiva, King Sibi giving away
the fl esh of his body to save a dove that was pursued
by a vulture, and the struggle between Krishna and
the Asuras for the possession of the Sun are among
other legends alluded to by the authors. The presence
of a great fi re underneath the ocean, Uttara-Kuru (the
Northern country) as a land of perpetual enjoyment,
Arundhati as the ideal of chastity, the conception of
the threefold debt- Rinatraya with which every man
is born, the beliefs that the cakora bird feeds only
on raindrops and that raindrops turn into pearls
in particular circumstances, are instances of other
Sanskritic ideas taken over bodily into the literature
of the Sangam period. The Tolkappiyam is said to
have been modelled on the Sanskrit grammar of the
Aindra School.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Forms of Marriage:</b> The Tolkappiyam states that
marriage as a sacrament attended with ritual was
established in the Tamil country by the Aryans. It is
well-known that the earliest Dharmashastras mention
eight forms of marriage as part of the Aryan code
itself, the result of a blend between Aryan and preAryan forms that prevailed in the North. These eight
forms are mentioned in the Tolkappiyam and other
works and much ingenuity is spend in accommodating them to Tamil forms.
The Tamils had a relatively simple conception of
marriage, they recognized the natural coming together
of man and woman, and the natural differences in
the manifestations of love, possibly due ultimately
to differences in the physical conditions of the different parts of the country. Natural love between
a man and a women, along with its different forms
of expression was designated as the five tinais. They
had also names for unilateral love, Kaikkilai and
improper love, perundinai. Although the people of
South India were fully acquainted with eight forms
of marriage, yet they did not paid special attention
to Vedic rituals and sacrements. Monogamy was the
approved form that a common man had to follow.
However, persons of prosperous status could marry
and keep more than one wife. Tamil damsels enjoyed
the liberty to marry persons of their choice.
        </li>
        <li>
        
        
        <b>Social Groups:</b> Differences in status and economic
conditions were accepted by all as part of the established order, and there is little evidence of any
tendency to protest or revolt against them. The poets
describe with equally intimate touches the unlettered
Malavar who thrive on robbery in the Northern
frontier of the Tamil land, the hunters (eniyar) with
their huts full of bows and shields, the homes of
shepherds who produced full quantities of curds and
ghee for sale, and those of learned Brahmins versed
in the Vedas and performing their daily ritual duties,
including the entertainment of guests.
Apparently, Brahmins ate meat and drank
toddy without incurring reproach. One poem in the
Purananuru affi rms that there are only four castes
(kudi), viz. tudiyan, panan, paraiyan and kadamban,
and only one god worthy of being worshipped with
paddy strewn before him, namely the hero-stone
recalling the fall of a brave warrior in battle. These
castes and this worship were of very great antiquity,
perhaps survivals from pre-Aryan times. The practice
of erecting hero-stones and of offering regular worship to them continued throughout the Sangam Age
and many centuries after. Foreigners (Yavanas) were
numerous in the ports on the seacoast like Tondi, Musiri and Puhar (Kaveri-pattinam), which they visited
for trade. Although unable to speak Tamil, they were
employed as palace-guards in Madura and on police
duty in the streets. Curiously, wrought lamps and
wine in bottles fi gure prominently among the articles
of trade brought to India by the Yavanas.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Food & Beverages:</b> No occasion was lost for holding
feast and the poets are most eloquent in their praise
of the sumptuous fare to which they were so often
asked. One poet declares to his patron: “I came to
see you that we might eat succulent chops of meat,
cooled after boiling and soft like the carded cotton of
the spinning women, and drink large pots of toddy
together.’ Another speaks of wine poured into golden
goblets by smiling women decked with jewels in the
court of Karikala. Among drinks particular mention
is made of foreign liquor in green bottles, of munnir
(‘triple water’) a mixture of milk from unripe coconut,
palm fruit juice and the juice of sugar-cane, and of
toddy, well-matured by being buried underground
for a long time in bamboo barrels. The habit of eating
betel leaves with lime and areca nut perhaps came
into use only after the Sangam Age.
        </li>
        <li>

        <b>Position of Widows:</b> Women are said to have
given up eating greens and bathing in cold water
when their husbands fell in battle. The lot of widows was a hard one; they had to cut off their hair,
discard all ornaments, and only eat the plainest food.
No wonder, perhaps, that some wives preferred to
die with their husbands and earn fame as satis. The
tonsure of widows, it may be noted by the way, like
the tying of the tali and the marriage ceremony, was
obviously a pre-Aryan Tamil custom taken over and
perpetuated into later times.
The heroism and devotion of the sati were doubtless applauded by public opinion, but the practice
was certainly not encouraged, much less enforced.
The perfect wife was held to be one who, at the
death of her husband, entered the burning pyre with
as little concern as if she were entering cool water
for a bath.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Other Social Activities :</b> In the sphere of religion
and ethics the infl uence of Northern ideas is most
marked. The practice of walking some distance to
escort a departing guest was observed by Karikala
who went on foot for a distance of ‘seven steps’
(saptapadi) before requesting him to mount a chariot
drawn by four milk-white steeds. The slaughter of
a cow, the destruction of a foetus, and the killing of
a Brahmin were accounted heinous offences, though
ingratitude, according to the established code, was
held to be even worse.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Funeral Rituals:</b> No single method was adopted
for the disposal of the dead; both cremation and inhumation with or without urns are freely mentioned.
A widow offered a rice-ball to her dead husband on
a bed of grass (darbha) and the pulaiyan had a part
to play in this funeral ritual. Sati was fairly common
though by no means universal.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Life Style & Culture:</b> The richer classes dwelt
in houses of brick and mortar, the wall often bore
paintings of divine fi gures and pictures of animal
life. Royal palaces were surrounded by gardens tastefully laid out. Houses and palaces were constructed
according to rules laid down in the shastra, care
being taken to start at an auspicious hour carefully
determined before hand. The Nedunalvadai, one of
the ‘Ten Idylls’, contains a detailed description of the
women’s apartments in the palace of Nedunjeliyan,
their walls and pillars and artistic lamps manufactured by the Yavanas. This is followed by an account
of the equipment of the bedroom in the palace, its
ivory bedsteads and superior cushions. High life even
in those early days was thus no stranger to refi ned
luxuries. The wife was highly honoured and was
held to be the light of the family. The common folk
dwelt in humbler structures in the towns and villages,
while outcastes and forest tribes lived in huts of sorts,
which are also described in the poems. The making
of rope charpoys by Pulaiyans and the use of animal
skins as mats for lying on deserve to be noted. The
Pattinappalai gives a vivid account of the life of the
fi sher folk of Puhar, the Paradavar, including some
of their holiday amusements.
Valuable hints on popular beliefs and customs are
scattered among the poems. There was much faith in
omens and astrology. One song mentions the portents,
which preceded the death of ‘Sey of the elephant
look’. A woman with disheveled hair was a bad omen.
There were fortunetellers who plied a busy trade.
Children were provided with amulets for warding off
evil, and rites were practiced which were supposed
to avert the mischief of demons (pey), to bring about
rain, and produce other desired results.
The banyan tree was considered to be the abode
of gods, while eclipses were held to be the result
of snakes eating up the Sun and the Moon. Crows
were believed to announce the arrival of guests, and
particularly the return of the absent husband to his
lonely wife, and were fed regularly in front of royal
palaces, as well, perhaps, as in every household. Mass
feeding of the poor was also known.
        </li>
        <li>

        <b>Trade & Commerce:</b> Trade, both inland and
foreign, was well organized and briskly carried on
throughout the period; Tamil poems, classical authors
and archaeological fi nds in South India all speak with
one voice on this subject. The great port-cities were
the emporia of foreign trade. Big ships, we are told,
entered the port of Puhar without slacking sail, and
poured out on the beach precious merchandise brought
from overseas. The extensive bazaar of the great city
was full of tall mansions of many apartments each
with doorways, with verandahs and corridors.
The family life of the rich merchants were carried
on in the upper fl oors, while the lower ones were set
apart for business. Besides the fl ags waving on the
masts of ships in harbour, various other kinds of fl ags
advertised the different kinds of merchandise as well
as the fashionable grog-shops. Saliyur in the Pandya
country and Bandar in Chera are counted among the
most important ports in the poems.
Horses were imported by sea into the Pandyan
kingdom, and elsewhere. The repairing of merchants ships after their voyages are mentioned, as
also lighthouses. People from different countries
gathered in the ports, and life in them was truly
cosmopolitan. The Yavanas sailed their large ships
to Musiri (Cranganore) bearing gold, and returned
laden with pepper and ‘the rare products of the sea
and mountain’ which the Chera king gave, so far the
evidence of the poems.
The author of the Periplus (75 A.D.) gives the
most valuable information about this trade between
India and the Roman Empire. He mentions the
ports of Naura (Cannanore), Tyndis – the Tondi of
the poems, identifi ed with Ponnani – and Muziris
(Musiri, Cranganore), and Nelcynda very near Kottayam, as of leading importance on the west coast.
Muziris abounded in ships sent there with cargoes
from Arabia and by the Greeks. Nelcynda was part of
the Pandyan kingdom. Bacare (Porakad) was another
port on the same coast.
This trade increased in volume after Hippalus, an
Egyptian pilot showed the possibility of large ships
sailing with the monsoon straight across the ocean
instead of small vessels hugging the coast and exposing themselves to many risks. Other ports of South
India mentioned by the author in order are Balita
(Varkalai), a village by the shore with a fi ne harbour
(Korkai) where were the pearl fi sheries of the Pandyan
kingdom worked by condemned criminals; Camara
(Kaveripattinam), Poduca (Pondi-cherry, Arikamedu)
and Sopatma (Markanam).
There were three types of craft used on the east
coast, ships of the country coasting along the shore,
other large vessels made of single logs bound together,
called sangara, and those which made the voyage to
Chryse and to the Ganges which were called Colandia
and were very large. He mentions Argaru (Uraiyur) as
the place to which were sent all the pearls gathered
on the coast and from which were exported muslins
called Argaritic. About the ports on the east coast he
adds: ‘There are imported into these places everything
made in Damirica, and the greatest part of what is
brought at any time from Egypt comes here.’ He notes
further that a great quantity of muslins was made in
the region of Masalia (Andhra country), and ivory
was a special product of the country further North,
Dosarene (i.e. Dasarna, Odisha).
The large quantities of gold and silver coins struck
by all the Roman emperors down to Nero (A.D. 54-68)
found in the interior of the Tamil land testify to the
extent of the trade, the presence of Roman settlers
in the Tamil country, and the periods of the rise and
decay of this active commerce. Its beginnings may be
traced to the reign of Augustus, if not to an earlier
time, as a phenomenally large number bearing his
stamps (and that of Tiberius) have been found.
In that reign, despite ‘emphases’ from the Pandya
ruler, this commerce was by no means extensive or
economically important. Soon, however, it assumed
new and unexpected proportions and ceased to be
a mere trade in luxuries.
After the death of Nero, the trade was not so much
confi ned to the Tamil land as before, but spread more
evenly along the Indian coasts, and was conducted
by barter rather than with money, the emperors
subsequent to Nero not being so well represented
in the coin finds.

Towards the end of the second century A.D. the
direct trade between the Egyptian Greeks of the Roman Empire and India declined, the traffi c passing
into the hands of the Arabians and, still more, the
Auxumites of East Africa. A new era commenced with
the rise of Constantinople in the fourth century A.D.
Roman coins reappeared in South India, and embassies were received by Constantine from the people
of the Maldives and Ceylon among others. Ceylon
was becoming important in the trade of the Indian
Ocean at this time, but the activities of the Byzantine
period bear no comparison with those of the earlier
age, which had drained the Roman Empire of much
of its treasure and evoked protests from the fi nanciers
of the empire as well as its moralists.
The trade of the early Roman Empire had wide
ramifi cations and was bound up with much exploration and colonization on the part Greeco-Romans
and Indians. When, after a long eclipse, the power
of the Chola kings revived in the tenth and eleventh
centuries, the seafaring instincts of the people had
not deserted them and that, in the favourable conditions then obtaining, they attempted tasks more
venturesome than anything they had achieved in
the earlier age.
Internal trade was also brisk. Caravans of merchants with carts and pack animals carried their
merchandise from place to place and from fair to fair.
Salt was an important commodity of trade and salt
merchants moved with their families in carts provided
with spare axles against contingencies. Barter played
a large part in all transactions.

        </li>
        <li>

        Cultivation & Crafts: The land was fertile and
there was plenty of grains, meat and fi sh; the Chera
country was noted for its buffaloes, jackfruit, pepper
and turmeric. The little principality of Pari abounded
in forest produce like ‘bamboo-rice’, jackfruit, valli
root and honey. Many rural activities like the cultivation of ragi and sugarcane and the harvesting and
drying of grain are described in the Sangam poems
in a vivid and realistic manner.
Agriculture was the mainstay of the national
economy, and most of its operations were carried
on by women of the lowest class (kadaisiyar) whose
status appears to have differed little from that of the
slave. The bulk of the land was owned by Vellarar,
the agriculturists par excellence, who commanded
a high social rank. The richer among them did not
plough the land themselves, but employed labourers
to do it. Besides owning land, they held offi cial posts
in the civil and military administration, and the titles
vel and arasu in the Chola country and Kavidi in the
Pandya were applied to them. They not only enjoyed
the jus connubi with royal families, but also shared
with the king the duties of war and the pleasures of
the chase and of the table. The poorer vellalars did
not shun manual labour, but worked on their own
small farms, as do the peasantry everywhere.
Spinning and weaving of cotton, and perhaps also
of silk, had attained a high degree of perfection. Spinning was then, as always, the part-time occupation of
women. The weaving of complex patterns on clothes
and silk is often mentioned in literature and, according to the Periplus, Uraiyur was a great centre of the
cotton trade. The poems mention cotton cloth as thin
as the slough of the snake or a cloud of steam, so
fi nely woven that the eye could not follow the course
of the thread. Scissors and needles were known and
employed in cutting hair and in dressmaking; a kind
of hair pomade (tagaram) is mentioned also.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religious Beliefs</i></strong></div>  

The Vedic religion had struck root in the South
must have become clear from the references to the
costly sacrifi ces performed by the monarchs of the
age. Brahmins devoted to their studies and religious
duties held a high position in society, and a song of
Avur Mulam Kirar portrays in much detail the life of
Vinnandayan, a Brahmin of the Kaundinya-gotra who
lived in Punjarur in the Chola country. The followers
of the Veda had often to engage in disputations with
rival sectaries, and many are the references to such
disputations proclaimed by the fl ying of fl ags and
carried on with much gesticulation of the hands. The
rival sects are not named, but they were doubtless
Jainism and Buddhism, which became more prominent
in the succeeding age. From all, Hinduism was the
dominant creed in this age. The worship of Subramanya (Murugan) and the legendary achievements
of that deity are often alluded to. Other members of
the pantheon were Shiva, Balarama, Vishnu, Krishna,
Ardhanarisvara and Anantasayi.
The details of Vishnu worship with tulasi (basil)
and bell are set forth in the Padiruppattu, and the
custom is mentioned of people starving in the temple
to invoke the grace of the god. Women went with
their children to offer worship in the temples in the
evenings. Asceticism was honoured and tridandi
(triple staff) ascetics are particularly mentioned.
The worship of Murugan was of ancient origin
and embodied some indigenous features like the
velandal, an ecstatic dance in his honour. Indra also
came in for special worship on the occasion of his
annual festival held in Puhar.
The epic poems of the post-Sangam period show
that music and dancing were intermingled with religious rites from early times, the worship of Korravai
by the hunters, of Krishna by the shepherdesses and
of Murugan by the Kuravas being the most striking
instances of this. A temple of Sarasvati is mentioned in
the Manimekalai, which also alludes to the Kapalikas,
as austere class of Shaiva ascetics.
