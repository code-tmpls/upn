<h3>The Gupta Period</h3>


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>After the breakup of Mauryan empire, the
Satavahana and Kushana emerged as two large
Political Powers.</li>
        <li>The Satavahana acted as a stabilizing factor in the
Deccan and south to which they gave political unity
and prosperity.</li>
        <li>The Kushanas performed the same role in the
north.</li>
        <li>Both these empires came to an end in the middle
of the 3rd century A.D.</li>
        <li>Kushana power in North India came to an end in
about 230 A.D. and after that, a good part of central
India fell to Murundas who continued to rule till
250 A.D.</li>
        <li>The Guptas fi nally overthrew Kushanas in about
275 A.D.</li>
        <li>On the ruins of the Kushana empire arose a new
empire which established its way over a good part
of the former dominions of both the Kushanas and
the Satavahanas.</li>
        <li>This was the empire of the Guptas who may have
been of vaishya origin.</li>
        <li>Little is known of the early Guptas; fi rst known
ruler was ‘Sri Gupta’ probably ruling over a small
portion of north Bengal and South Bihar.</li>
        <li>He was succeeded by his son Ghatotkacha. Both
adopted the title of Maharaja.</li>
        <li>He married a Lichchavi princes Kumara Devi and
had her portrait engraved on his coins.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chandragupta I (319-335 A.D.)</i></strong></div>  
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Chandragupta was the first Gupta king who
minted silver coins after defeating Saka satraps of
Ujjain and also in the name of his queen and the
Lichchhavi nation.</li>
        <li>Chandragupta I seems to have been a ruler of
considerable importance because he started Gupta
Era in A.D. 319-20 which marked the date of his
accession.</li>
        <li>He emphasized his power and prestige by marrying
Kumara Devi, Princess of the Lichchhavi nation of
Nepal.</li>
        <li>He acquired the title of Maharajadhiraj.</li>


    </ul>
</ol>




<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Samudragupta (335-375 A.D.)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Samudragupta (335-380 A.D.), called the ‘Napoleon
of India’ by Vincent Smith, enlarged the Gupta
Kingdom enormously.</li>
        <li>The Allahabad pillar inscription composed by
Harisena, his court poet enumerates the people and
countries that were conquered by Samudragupta,
which had been divided into 5 groups.</li>
        <li>12 Kings were defeated in course of Samudragupts’s
dakshinapath campaign, who reached as far
as Kanchi and Pallava ruler Vishnugupta was
compelled to recognise his suzerainty. But he
reinstated all the 12 kingdoms as tributary states.</li>
        <li>Virasen was the army commander in the famous
Southern campaign of Samudragupta. In Allahabad
inscription Samudragupta describes him as the
hero of hundred battles.</li>
        <li>In one of his coins he called himself ‘Lichchhavi
duhitra’ (daughter’s son of the Lichchhavis).
• He performed Asvamedha Yajna to claim imperial
title and struck gold coins of yupa type to
commemorate the occasion.</li>
        <li>He maintained the tradition of religious toleration,
granted permission to Buddhist king of Cylon,
Meghavarman to build a monastry at Bodh Gaya;
so, he was called ‘Anukampavav’.</li>
        <li>He was a great patron of art, adopted the title of
‘Kaviraja’. Poets like Harisena and Vasubandhu
adorned his court; on some gold coins he was
shown playing the Veena.</li>
        <li>On one of the coins Samudragupta is represented
as playing fl ute. He also patronized the Buddhist
scholar Vasubandhu and studied Buddhism under
him.</li>
        <li>Though a follower of the Brahmannical religion
and follower of Vasudeva, he was tolerant towards
other faiths. He received a missionary from the
ruler Meghavarman of Sri Lanka, seeking his
permission to build a Buddhist temple at Gaya,
which he granted.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chandragupta II (380-413 A.D.)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Samudragupta was succeeded by Ramgupta but
Chandragupta II killed him and married his queen
Dhruvadevi.</li>
        <li>Chandragupta II was also a great conqueror like
his father and his reign saw the high water mark of
the Gupta empire. Mehrauli Iron pillar inscription claims his authority over North- Western India and
a good portion of Bengal.</li>
        <li>Chandragupta II’s daughter Prabhavati was
married to the Vakataka King, Rudrasena II who
died very soon.</li>
        <li>The sea-borne trade with Europe brought
Chandragupta II in close contact with Europe
through Egypt.</li>
        <li>Chandragupta is represented as killing a lion on
his coins unlike his father who is shown killing a
tiger.</li>
        <li>Though Fa-hien (the Chinese pilgrim) travelled
extensively in Chandragupta’s empire and records
the prosperity during this time, it is interesting
to note that the Chinese pilgrim never recorded
the name of the king because he was totally preoccupied with the study of Buddhism.</li>
        <li>Chandragupta II Vikramaditya was the fi rst among
the Gupta kings to issue gold coins.
 These coins were modelled on the silver coins
issued by the Sakas of western and central India.</li>
        <li>Virasena’s Udyagiri cave inscription refers to his
conquest of the whole world.</li>
        <li>He defeated the last of the Saka ruler Rudra Simha
III and annexed the territories of western Malwa
and Gujarat. He was also called ‘Vikramaditya’.
He also took the title of Simhavikrama.</li>
        <li>Chandragupta II made Ujjain the second capital of
the empire.</li>
        <li>He strengthened the empire by matrimonial
alliance, married his daughter Prabhavati to a
Vakataka Prince Rudrasena II, he himself married
a Naga princes ‘Kuber Naga’.</li>
        <li>He was also a man of art and culture, his court
at Ujjain was adorned by ‘Navratna’, including
Kalidasa, Amarsinha, Fa-hien, Acharya Dinganaga,
etc.</li>
        <li>Virasena was the Court Poet and Minister of
Chandragupta II.</li>
        <li>Fa-hien, the Chinese traveller, came during the time
of Chandragupta II.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kumaragupta I (413-455 A.D.)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>He assumed the title of Mahendraditya.</li>
        <li>Founded the Nalanda University.</li>
        <li>He was a worshipper of Lord Kartikeya (son of
Lord Shiva).</li>
        <li>Kumargupta I introduced a new type of coins
of gold. One of them fi gures the God Kartikeya
ridding on his peacock on the reverse, and the king
feeding a peacock on the obverse.</li>
        <li>The first Huna attack took place during Kumargupta
I. He was very old that time. The aged Kumargupta
died when the crown prince was still in the fi eld in
A.D. 454 or 455.</li>
        <li>Kumargupta performed Asvamedha sacrifi ces, but
we do not know of his any military success, though
he maintained the vast empire intact.</li>
        <li>Towards the close of his reign, the empire was
attacked by the Pushyamitra tribe.</li>
        <li>By 485 A.D. the Hunas occupied eastern Malwa
and a good portion of Central India.</li>
        <li>Although the Huna power was soon overthrown
by Yasodharman of Malwa, the Malwa prince
successfully challenged the authority of the Guptas
and set up pillars of victory commemorating his
conquest of almost the whole of Northern India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>




<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Skandagupta (455-467 A.D.)</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>One of the gold coins of the king Skandagupta
depicts the king as standing with a bow in one hand
and an arrow in the other with a Garuda standard
in front of him. To his right is Goddess Laxmi facing
the king with a lotus in her hand.</li>
        <li>He restored the Sudarshana Lake.</li>
        <li>Skandagupta repulsed the ferocious Hunas twice,
this heroic feat entitled him to assume the title of
Vikramaditya.</li>
        <li>Sakandagupta’s successors proved to be weak and
could not resist the Huna invaders, who excelled
in horsemanship and possibly used stirrups made
of metal.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fall of the Gupta Empire</i></strong></div>  


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The weak successors of Skandagupta could not
check the growing Huna power and feudatories
rose in Bihar, Bengal, M.P., Vallabhi, etc.</li>
        <li>Mihirkula was the most famous Huna King.
Hieun Tsang mentions him as a fi erce persecutor
of Buddhism. He was defeated by Yashodharman,
one of the feudatories of the Guptas in Malwa.</li>
        <li>Later Guptas of Magadha established their power
in Bihar, alongside them the Maukharies rose
to power in Bihar and U.P. with their capital at
Kannauj, the Maitrakas of Vallabhi established their
authority in Gujarat and Western Malwa.</li>
        <li>In North India the Pushyabhutis of Thaneshwar
established their power in Haryana and they
gradually moved to Kannauj.</li>
        <li>The Gupta state may have found it diffi cult to
maintain a large professional army on account of
the growing practice of land grants for religious
and other purposes, which was bound to reduce
their revenues.</li>
        <li>Their income may have further been affected by
the decline of foreign trade.</li>
        <li>Loss of Western India deprived the Guptas of rich
revenues from trade and commerce and crippled
them economically.</li>
        <li>The migration of a guild of silk weavers from
Gujarat to Malwa in A.D. 473 and their adoption
of non-productive professions show that there was
not much demand for silk.</li>
        <li>Decline of trade led to decay of towns, the postGupta period witnessed the 
            ruin of many old commercial cities.</li>
        <li>The later Guptas, though they ruled in Magadha
till about the eight-century, were not genealogically
connected to the Imperial Guptas.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trade and Economy</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Kalidasa gives good description of the market
towns.</li>
        <li>The volume of trade with China greatly increased
during Gupta period and the Chinese silk was
called ‘Chinansuka’ in India.</li>
        <li>Indian muslin was said to have created a great
demand in the city of Rome.</li>
        <li>At Kaveripattinam, the Yavana section of the city
overflowed with prosperity.</li>
        <li>At Arikamedu, a sizeable Roman settlement and a
Roman factory was discovered (it was known for
Muslin).</li>
        <li>Barygaza or Broach was the largest port on the
western coast.</li>
        <li>Glass production started in the Gupta period.</li>
        <li>Indian embassies visited the Roman Empire in
the reigns of Aurelian, Constantine, Julian, and
Justinian, and Alexandria became an important
meeting place for the inhabintants and traders of
India and Rome.</li>
        <li>Varahmihira paid tribute to Greek astronomers by
saying that they deserve as much respect as our
own rishis.</li>
        <li>Indians were the fi rst in the world to advocate
the internal use of mercury. It is mentioned by
Varahmihira along with iron. The Indian surgeon
performed lithotomy and could remove the
external matter accidentally introduced into the
body e.g. iron, stones, etc.</li>
        <li>Gold coins were called Dinars and silver coins were
called Rupyakas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Organization</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In contrast to the Mauryas, the Gupta kings
adopted pompous titles such as ‘Parmeshwar’
‘Maharajadhiraja’ and ‘Param-bhattaraka’ which
signify that they ruled over lesser kings in their
empire.</li>
        <li>Element of divinity in kingship; kings compared
with different gods and were looked upon as
Vishnu, the protector and preserver.</li>
        <li>Kingship was hereditary, but royal power was
limited by the absence of a firm practice of
primogeniture.</li>
        <li>Council of ministers existed; evidence of one man
holding several posts like Harisena and posts
becoming hereditary.</li>
        <li>The most important offi cers were Kumaramatyas.</li>
        <li>The empire was divided into ‘Bhukti’ placed under
the charge of an ‘Uparika’.</li>
        <li>The sub-districts were called ‘Peth’ and the villages
were under ‘Gramika’ or ‘Mahattar’.</li>
        <li>The Guptas did not maintain a vast bureaucracy
like that of the Mauryas.</li>
        <li>‘Kumaramatyas’ were the most important offi cers
who were appointed by the king in the home
provinces.</li>
        <li>Chariots receded into the background and cavalry
came to the forefront.</li>
        <li>In judicial system, for the first time civil and criminal
laws were clearly defined and demarcated.</li>
        <li>The most salient feature of the Gupta rule is
personal liberty. The people were left largely
to follow their own ideas and pursue their own
intentions.</li>
        <li> The Vakataka empire in the Deccan was more
centralized and united than the Satavahanas,
though the Vakatakas continued the same
administrative system and practices as it was
during the Satavahanas.</li>
        <li>In the Gupta period land taxes increased in number,
and also those on trade and commerce.</li>
        <li>A large part of the empire was administered by
feudatories, many of whom had been subjected by
Samudragupta.</li>
        <li>The second important fedual development
in administration was the grant of fiscal and
administrative concessions to priests and
administrators. Salary was not paid in cash.</li>
        <li>Religious functionaries were granted land called
‘Agarhara’, free of taxes for ever, and they were
authorised to collect from peasants all taxes, which
could have otherwise gone to the emperor.</li>
        <li>Land revenue was about 1/7 of the produce
payable either in cash or kind.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Organization</i></strong></div>  


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Aryan pattern of society based on ‘Varnashram
Dharma’ made its fi nal assertion. Land grants to
Brahmanas suggest Brahaman supremacy.</li>
        <li>Caste proliferated into numerous sub-castes, fi rstly,
as a result of assimilation of a large number of
foreigners into Indian society, and secondly due to
absorption of many tribal people in Brahmanical
society through process of land grants.</li>
        <li>Though women were idealized in literature, mother
goddesses were worshipped, but in reality they
were accorded lower postion viz. pre-puberty
marriage, denial of education, treated as an item of
property, etc. Though they were allowed to listen
to the Epics and the Puranas, like the Shudras.</li>
        <li>The position of the Shudra somewhat improved
but number of untouchables and the practice of
untouchability increased.</li>
        <li>The first example of Sati came from Eran of 510
A.D. Sati system was very rare in the Gupta period,
almost the only recorded instance in the age being
that of the Goparaja’s wife in A.D. 510. came to
light from Eran (M.P.).</li>
        <li>The Vakataka period (roughly from about A.D.
250-250) coincided with the most creative period
of Mahayana Buddhism.</li>
        <li>Nagarjuna established the Shunyavada philosophy,
he infused a new life into Buddhism and helped
the eventual development of the Advaita school in
the Hindu Vedanta.</li>
        <li>It is very likely that Kaildasa lived for some time in
the Vakataka court, as a part of the ‘Meghadduta’
must have been composed there.</li>
        <li>Patanjali tells us that the maidservant and the
shudra women were meant for satisfying the
pleasure of upper classes.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religion</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Many legal text books were written during this
period such as the Bhagwad Gita, Yajnavalkaya
Smriti, Narada Smriti, Brihaspati Smriti, etc.</li>
        <li>Hinduism acquired its present shape, Brahma,
Vishnu & Mahesh emerged as the supreme deity.</li>
        <li>Devotional Hinduism got perfection and
Bhagvatism became more popular, centred round
the worship of Vishnu or Bhagvat. History was
presented as a cycle of 10 incarnations of Vishnu.</li>
        <li>Theory of Karma and idea of Bhakti and Ahimsa
became the foundation of Bhagvatism.</li>
        <li>Idol worship in the temples became a common
feature.</li>
        <li>Concept of incarnations or Avatara of Vishnu
preached.</li>
        <li>Various female deities such as Durga, Amba,
Kali, Chandi, etc. came to be regarded as mother
goddesses.</li>
        <li>Four ends of life were enumerated-Dharma, Artha,
Kama and Moksha, fi rst three collectively called
‘Triverga’</li>
        <li>Six schools of philosophy were perfected.</li>
        <li>Buddhism no longer received royal patronage in
the Gupta period.</li>
        <li>Fa-hien has given the impression that this religion
was in flourishing state.</li>
        <li>But really it was not so important in the Gupta
period as it was in the days of Ashoka and
Kanishka.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Science and Technology</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Gupta period is unparalleled for its achievements
in the field of mathematics and astronomy.</li>
        <li>Brahmagupta in 7th century developed rules foroperating with zero and negative quantities, he
began to apply algebra to astronomical problems.
He wrote Brahmasphutic Siddhanta in which he
hinted at the law of gravitation.</li>
        <li>Prominent astronomers were Aryabhatta
and Varahamihira. Aryabhatta was the first
astronomer who wrote Arya-bhattiyam, found
the causes of lunar and solar eclipses, calculated
the circumference of the earth in Suryasiddhanta,
which is still almost correct.</li>
        <li>Aryabhatta described the value of first nine
numbers and the use of zero in Aryabhattiyam.
He also calculatd the value of pie and invented
Algebra.</li>
        <li>He was fi rst to reveal that the Sun is stationary and
the earth revolves round it.</li>
        <li>Varahamihira ’s well - known work was
‘Brihatsamhita’, it stated that the Moon rotates
round the Earth and the Earth rotates round the
Sun.</li>
        <li>He also wrote ‘Panch Siddhantika’ which gives the
summary of fi ve astronomical books current in his
time.</li>
        <li>Romaka Siddhanta, a book on astronomy was also
compiled and was perhaps infl uenced by Greek
ideas.</li>
        <li>Vagbhatta was the most distinguished physician
of the ayurvedic system of medicine.</li>
        <li>Palakapya wrote Hastyagarved, a treatise on the
diseases of elephants.</li>
        <li>Dhanvantri was famous for Ayurveda
knowledge.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Literature</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sanskrit language and literature made much
headway during this period. This was the language
of scholars.</li>
        <li>From this time onward we fi nd greater emphasis
on verses than prose.</li>
        <li>Although we get a good deal of Brahmanical
religious literature, the period also produced some
of the earliest pieces of secular literature.</li>
        <li>The greatest Sanskrit poet and dramatist of
the Gupta age was Kalidasa, his important
works were-Meghdutam, Abhijana Shakuntalam,
Kumarsambhava, Raghuvamsa, Ritusamhara,
Malvikagnimitra, etc.</li>
        <li>Vishakhadatta produced the ‘Mudrarakshasa’ and
the ‘Devichandraguptam’.</li>
        <li>Apart from Kalidasa others were Sudraka who
authored Mrichchakatikam, Bharavi wrote
Kiratarjunia, Dandin’s Kavyadarshana and
Dasakumaracharita. To this period belong the
13 plays written by Bhasa. Most famous was
Charudatta.</li>
        <li>Vishnu Sharma wrote Panchatantra and
Hitopdesh.</li>
        <li>All the literary works of this period were comedies
and character of higher and lower classes did not
speak the same language: women and shudra
featuring in these plays used Prakrit.</li>
        <li>Both the Ramayana and the Mahabharata along
with various Puranas and Smrities were fi nally
compiled.</li>
        <li>Amarsimha wrote ‘Amarkosha’.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Art and Architecture</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Gupta craftsmen distinguished themselves
by their work in iron and bronze. Several bronze
images of the Buddha were produced.</li>
        <li>In the case of iron objects, the best example is the
famous Iron pillar found at Mehrauli. It has withstood
rain and weather for centuries without rusting.</li>
        <li>This period marks the beginning of temple
architecture.</li>
        <li>Dasavatara temple at Deogarh in Jhansi is the
finest square temple with a low and squat shikhara
(tower) above.</li>
        <li>The temple at Bhitargaon near Kanpur is made of

        <li>Metal sculpture of a high degree is testifi ed by
the over two metre high bronze image of Buddha
recovered from Sultanganj near Bhagalpur.</li>
        <li>Gupta stone sculptural art was related to the
Mathura school.</li>
        <li>Painting reached its zenith with regard to aesthetic
and technical standard as is furnished by the

        <li>Buddha sitting in Dharma Chakra mudra belongs
to Sarnath and the Buddha images of Bamiyan,
Afghanistan belong to the Gupta period.</li>
        <li>Images of Vishnu, Shiva and some other Hindu
