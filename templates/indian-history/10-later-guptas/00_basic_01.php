<h3>Later Guptas (7-12 Century A.D)</h3>

By the middle of the 6th century a line of Gupta
rulers with the same surname, but not connected in
the offi cial geneology with the line, ruled in Magadha.
In fact, the name ending “Gupta” may have been chosen and cherised by the Later Guptas in an attempt
to bring the family closer, in the eyes of the people,
to well-established Imperial Gupta dynasty. Krishna
Gupta (480-502 A.D.), the founder of the dynasty, and
his two successors, Harsha Gupta and Jivita-Gupta
may be regarded as feudatories of the main Guptas.
The dynasty came into its own with the accession
of Kumar Gupta, who made his kingdom more than
a mere principality. Malwa was the chief centre of
Later Guptas until the rise of Harsha.
Mahasena Gupta was the most famous ruler of this
dynasty, probably, he defeated the Maukharis. He associated himself with the rising Pushyabhuti dynasty and
giving in marriage his sister to Aditya Vardhan, the grand
father of Harsha. Thus, Mahasena Gupta, with the help
of Pushyabhuti, recovered his kingdom and got victory
over Kamarupa (Assam). Mahasena Gupta’s two sons
were sent to Thaneshwar to be companions of Harsha
and the third son remained at Malwa. Harsha’s empire
included Magadha which he entrusted to the Madhava
Gupta, the fi rst son of Mahasena Gupta.
Thus, actually two lines of Later Guptas came into existence. The Guptas of Magadha continued to prosper.
But the story of Malwa is different. The Gupta
ruler of Malwa Deva Gupta attacked Maukhari king
Graha Varman and killed him. Graha Varman had
married Rajyashri, the sister of Rajya Vardhan and
Harsha Vardhan. Rajya Vardhan marched to Malwa,
killed Deva Gupta and annexed the territory to his
dominions. Thus, the Malwa branch of the Later
Guptas came to an end.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Maukharis</i></strong></div>  

In the second half of the sixth century, Kanyakubja
(Kannauj) rose to the prominence as the capital of the
Maukharis. The fi rst three kings of this dynasty are
given the simple title of Maharaja. The fourth king
Ishana-Varman (550-560 A.D.) took the title of Maharajadhiraja. He followed an aggressive expansionist policy. After defeating the Andhras, the Sulivas
and the Gauda, he came into confl ict with the Later
Guptas of Magadha. He was succeeded by Sri Sarva
Varman, who fi rmly established Maukharis supremacy
in Madhya-desha. The next famous ruler of this dynasty was Graha Varman, who married Rajyashri of
the Pushyabhuti family of Thaneshwar. The wicked
king of Malwa killed Graha Varman and imprisoned
Rajyashri. The kingdom of Kannauj was combined
with that of Thaneshwar of Harsha Vardhan.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Pushyabhutis</i></strong></div> 

The first three rulers of this dynasty i.e. Nara Vardhan, Rajya Vardhan and Aditya Vardhan are given
the simple title of Maharaja. It shows that these rulers were initially feudal-lords under Gupta Kingdom
and subsequently the Huna kings. Aditya Vardhan’s
son Prabhakara Vardhan (A.D. 583-605) was the fi rst
ruler of the dynasty to assume the title Param Bhattarak Maharaja–dhiraja. He defeated Hunas, Sindhu
kings, Gurjaras, the Lord of Gandhara and the kings
of Malwa. His desire for conquest was eventually
carried out by his younger son Harsha Vardhan.
Prabhakar Vardhan had made a matrimonial alliance with the Maukharis by giving in marriage his
daughter Rajyashri to Graha Varman. As a result of
this engagement, the Maukhari nobles, on the death
of their last king Graha Varman, requested Harsha,
the reigning Pushybhuti king to unite his kingdom
with the Maukhari kingdom and rule from Kannauj.
Prabhakar Vardhan was succeeded by his elder son
Rajya Vardhan, but shortly he was killed in a battle
with Shasanka of Gauda (Bengal). He was succeeded
by Harsha Vardhan, his younger brother who was actually elected to the throne by the Mantri parishad.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Harsha Vardhana
(606-647 A.D.)</i></strong></div> 

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Hieun-Tsang informs us that Harsha was reluctant
to take the responsibilities of kingship.</li>
        <li>He belonged to the Pushyabhuti family and was
the son of Prabhakar vardhan, originally the
feudatories of the Guptas.</li>
        <li>Rajyavardhan succeeded Prabhakaravardhan.
Grahavardhan, the Maukhari ruler of Kannauj
and husband of Rajyasri (daughter of Prabhakara)
was murdered by Devagupta, the ruler of Malwa 
who in alliance with Sasanka, ruler of Gauda and
Bengal occupied Kannauj and imprisoned Rajyasri.
Rajyavardhan undertook a campaign against
Devagupta and killed him but was deceived and
killed by Sasanka.</li>
        <li>Harsha now succeeded his brother at Thaneswar.
He brought most of north under his control and
assumed the title of ‘Siladitya’.</li>
        <li>Originally belonged to Thaneswar, but shifted to
Kannauj which after his death was won from his
successors by the Pratiharas.</li>
        <li>Brought ‘5 Indies’ under his control – Punjab,
Kannauj, Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.</li>
        <li>Harsha used to celebrate a solemn festival at
Prayag, Allahabad at the end of every 5 years.</li>
        <li>He was a great patron of learning and established a
large monastery at Nalanda. Banabhatta, who adored
his court wrote Harshacharita, Parvatiparinay
and Kadambari. Harsha himself wrote 3 plays:
Priyadarshika, Ratnavali and Nagananda.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Buddhism during Harsha’s reign</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Puranavarman of Magadha, the last of the race of
Ashoka, was one of the vassals of Harsha. He is
reputed to have brought back to life the bodhi tree,
cut down to its roots by Shashanka, by watering its
roots with the milk of hundred cows.</li>
        <li>Harsha’s brother and sister were ardent Hinayana
Buddhists and he himself developed strong
leanings towards Mahayana Buddhism after he
came in contact with Hieun-Tsang.</li>
        <li>Though the Chinese traveller Hieun-Tsang counted
nearly 200,000 Buddhist monks, yet it is clear that
Buddhism was clearly on the path of decline against
the resurgent Puranic Hinduism.</li>
        <li>In Harsha’s time, Jainism was prevalent only in the
places like Vaishali and eastern Bengal.</li>
        <li>In spite of losses due to accidents and robbery,
Hieun-Tsang took with him to China 150 pieces of
Buddha’s bodily relics; many images of teachers in
gold, silver and sandalwood and 657 volumes of
manuscripts, carried upon 20 horses.</li>
        <li>In this period, Tantricism in both Hinduism and
Buddhism came to the forefront.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Organization and State
Administration</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Nothing is known of the city of Kannauj after the
death of Harsha until A.D. 730, when Yasovarman,
who may have been a Maukhari king, was ruling
there. Yasovarman was a famous monarch who
sent an embassy to China in A.D. 731.</li>
        <li>Samanta system emerged in the post-Gupta period
and by the time of Harshvardhan, it was widely
prevalent all over North India.</li>
        <li>Harsha relied more on personal supervision than
on an organized bureaucracy.</li>
        <li>There seems to have been a council of ministers,
which wielded real power on occasions.</li>
        <li>According to Hieun-Tsang, the offi cers received
their salaries in kind, in grants of land, and were
paid according to their work.</li>
        <li>Treason against the king was punished by lifelong
imprisonment. Taxation was light and 1/6 was the
royal share of the land revenue from the people.</li>
        <li>The existence of a department of records and
archives shows the enlightened character of the
administration.</li>
        <li>Harsha governed empire on the same line as the
Guptas did except that his administration had
become more feudal and decentralised.</li>
        <li>Land grants continued to be made to priests for
special services rendered to the state.</li>
        <li>In addition Harsha is credited with the grant of land
to the offi cers by charters as in case the Agrahara
lands.</li>
        <li>The Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang informs us that the
revenues of Harsha were divided into four parts.</li>
        <li>One part was earmarked for the expenditure of
the king, a second for scholars, a third for the
endowment of offi cials and public servants and a
fourth for religious purpose.</li>
        <li>He also tells us that ministers and high offi cers
of the state were endowed with land. The feudal
practice of rewarding and paying offi cers with
grants of land seems to have begun under Harsha.
This explains why we do not have too many coins
issued by King Harsha.</li>
        <li>In the empire of Harsha, law and order was not
well-maintained.</li>
        <li>The Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsang, about whom
special care may have been taken by the government,
was robbed of his belonging, although he reports
that according to the law of the land severe
punishments were infl icted for crime.</li>
        <li>Robbery was considered to be a second treason for
which the right hand of the robber was amputated.
But it seems that under the infl uence of Buddhism,
the severity of punishment was mitigated and
criminals were imprisoned for life.</li>
        <li>Harsha is called the last great Hindu emperor of
India, but he was neither a staunch Hindu nor the
ruler of the whole country.</li>
        <li>His authority was limited to North India, except
Kashmir-Rajasthan, Punjab, Utter Pradesh, Bihar and
Orissa were under his direct control, but his sphere of
influence spread over a much wider area.</li>
        <li>It seems that the peripheral states acknowledged
his sovereignty. Harsha was unable to extend his
power in eastern and southern India.</li>
        <li>In eastern India he faced opposition from the
Shaivite king Shashanka of Gauda, who cut off the
Bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya. But Shashanka’s death in
619 put an end to this hostility.</li>
        <li>Harsha’s southward march was stopped on the
Narmada river by the Chalukyan king Pulkesin II
in 620 A.D., who ruled over a great part of modern
Karnataka and Maharashtra with his capital at
Badami in the modern Bijapur district of Karnataka.
Pulskesin II bestowed the title of ‘the lord of the
entire north’, on him.</li>
        <li>Events towards the end of Harsha’s reign are
described in Chinese sources.</li>
        <li>T’ang Emperor of China Tai-Tsung sent an
ambassador to Harsha’s court in 643 and again in
647. On the second occasion the Chinese ambassador
found that Harsha had died and that the throne had
been usurped by an undeserving king.</li>
        <li>The Chinese ambassador rushed to Nepal and
Assam and raised a force with which the allies of
Harsha defeated the usurper, who was taken to
China as a prisoner.</li>
        <li>The kingdom of Harsha Vardhan disintegrated
rapidly into small states after his death. The
three border states of Assam, Nepal and Kashmir
resumed their independence. Northern India was
divided among several Rajput States.</li>
        <li>Village was divided into groups of 10 for the
purpose of assessment in the Deccan and in the
groups of 12 or 16 in the northern region.</li>
        <li>The power and privileges of the feudatories were
clearly on the rises in this period and the biggest
casualties were the lower classes and women.</li>
        <li>The relationship between the village authorities
and the feudatories was clearly defi ned. Brahmanas
were granted tax-free lands as well as many
privileges along with it.</li>
        <li>The beginning of the practice of making religious
grants roughly synchronizes with the date of the
earliest epic and the Puranic description of the
Kaliyuga or the age of social crisis.</li>
        <li>Grants of land were made to the priests and the
temples, and later to royal offi cers, along with fi scal
and administrative immunities, which undermined
the authority of the state.</li>
        <li>The fiscal concessions accompanying the land
grants included the royal right over salt and mines,
which were royal monopolies in the Mauryan
period and evidently signs of sovereignty.</li>
        <li>Now, villages were granted in perpetuity to the
beneficiaries, often with administrative rights.</li>
        <li>The recipients of land grants in north India were
empowered to punish thieves and other criminals;
in central and western India from the fi fth century
onwards, they were also given the right to try the
civil cases.</li>
        <li>The transfer of magisterial and police powers
together with fi scal rights to the donees not only
weakened the royal authority, but also led to the
oppression of peasants and inhabitants of the gift
villages who were asked to obey their new masters
and carry out their orders.</li>
        <li>Several inscriptions indicated the emergence of
serfdom, which meant that the peasants were attached
to their land even when it was given away. Perhaps
this began in South India in the earlier period because
a third century Pallava grant informs us that four
sharecroppers were asked to remain attached to their
land which was given to the brahmanas.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hieun-Tsang’s Account</i></strong></div>  

Hieun-Tsang (or Yuan Chwang) was the most
celebrated of all the Chinese pilgrims who came to
India. He visited India in the fi rst half of the seventh
century A.D. and spent about 15 years (630-645) in
the country. During this period he travelled all over
the country and observed everything very minutely.
No doubt he came to this country with the chief aim
of collecting the Buddhist scriptures and visiting
all those places connected with the Lord, but his
clever eyes left nothing unnoticed. He retuned to
his country with a lot of material concerned with
the Buddhist faith (such as Buddhist relics, images
of Buddha and about 657 volumes of manuscripts),
but above all he carried with him the memories of
this land. After reaching his homeland, he translated
all his memories in the book-form entitled ‘Si-yu-Ki’
or the Records of the Western world. This book is
an invaluable source of information regarding Harsha and the political, social, religious and economic
conditions of India during his reign (or in the fi rst
half of seventh century A.D.).
According to Dr. V.A. Smith, this book is a treasure house of accurate information, indispensable to
every student of Indian antiquity and has done more
than any archaeological discovery to render possible
the remarkable re-association (revival) of lost history.
From Hieun-Tsang’s account, the following important
information is derived regarding Harsha and the
condition of India during his time:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Kingdom of HarshaVardhan:</b> Hieun-Tsang spent
about eight years in Harsha’s court and consequently
he had written in detail about his character and
personality. According to Hieun-Tsang, Harsha was
a very generous king who used to give a major portion of 
his revenue in alms to the poor, the needy
and religious men. He had built a large number of
rest houses, hospitals, stupas, monasteries, and other
works of public utility. He was a very dutiful king
who never felt tired while serving his people. In the
very words of Hieun-Tsang, “He was indefatigable
and forgot sleep and food in the discharge of his
duties.” Again, “the day was too short for him. He
was the busiest of men and devoted all his time to
promote the welfare of his people.”
About Harsha’s religious views, he writes that in
the beginning he was a worshipper of Shiva and the
Sun and later on he became a follower of Buddhism.
Then, he devoted all his energies for the spread of
his faith. Hieun-Tsang writes that Harsha led a very
luxurious life and often bathed in vessels of gold and
silver. Harsha’s capital Kannauj was known all round
for its lofty structures, beautiful gardens, tanks to
clear water and museum of varieties collected from
strange lands. It was a great cosmopolitan town with
one hundred Buddhist monasteries and about two
hundred deva temples; it had greatly grown in its
importance under Harsha.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Political Condition and Administration:</b> HieunTsang has written in detail about Harsha’s administration and the political condition of India during his
times. He has every praise for Harsha’s administration.
Harsha fully knew that in order to make the life of
his subjects happy, a good deal of personal supervision was most essential, from time to time he himself
used to go from place to place in order to punish the
evil-doers and reward the good.
Harsha’s government was based on benign and
generous principles. Hieun-Tsang further writes,
“The government is generous, offi cial requirements
are few, families are not registered and individuals
are not subject to forced labour-contribution”. Taxes
were very light. The source of income was the landtax which was 1/6 of the total produce. The royal
income was spent in a very systematic way. Its onefourth part was spent on government, one-fourth on
the maintenance of the public servants, one fourth to
reward the learned and the rest portion was reserved
for distributing gifts among holymen.
The penal code was very severe and sometimes
hands, ears or nose were also cut off. Fines were also
infl icted and trial by ordeal was also known, though
it was awarded very rarely. Hieun-Tsang, however,
writes that roads were not so safe as he himself was
thrice looted and once even his clothes were snatched
away from him.
According to Hieun-Tsang, there was a special
department of keeping records of all the important
events of the state. In these records, good and bad
events were recorded and instances of public calamity and good fortune are set forth in detail. HieunTsang says that Harsha had maintained a powerful
and well-equipped army which was over two lakhs.
It was comprised of 50,000 infantry, 6,000 elephants
and 100,000 horsemen.
</li>
<li>
<b>Socio-economic Condition:</b> From certain casual
remarks of Hieun-Tsang, we can form an idea of
the social and economic conditions of India during
Harsha’s reign. About the dress and general appearance of the people, he writes that they wore simple
dress comprising inner clothing and outward garment
which did not involve any tailoring work. They were,
however, very fond of ornaments. Again, he writes
that most of the people go bare-footed and shoes are
rare. The food of the people was very simple and
pure. They generally took milk, ghee, rice, grain and
vegetables. Onions and garlics were rarely used and
the use of meat was not so common.
About the architecture or house planning of the
people, Hieun-Tsang writes that their walls were
generally built of brick, and often coated with chunam. The roofs were sometimes made of thatched
reed matting but generally there were wooden fl at
roofed rooms which were often covered with tiles,
burnt and unborn. Their fl oors were purifi ed with
cow dung and strewn with fl owers of the season.
Their houses, in short, were ‘sumptuous inside and
economical outside.’ According to Hieun-Tsang, the
architecture of public building and Buddhist monasteries was very remarkable.
The people in those days had a high sense of
cleanliness. According to Hieun-Tsang, “They are pure
on their own accord and not from any compulsion.
Before every meal they must have a wash, the fragment and remains are not served up again. The food
utensils are not passed on.” Persons who followed
unclean or disreputable occupations (like butchers,
fi sherman, executioners and scavengers) had to live
outside the city.
The people also led a high moral life. They were
hospitable, honest, generous and charitable. They were
afraid of doing any thing wrong and sinful. According
to Hieun-Tsang, they are of pure moral principle.
Hieun-Tsang has thrown a good deal of light on the
social customs of the people. The caste-taboos had become very rigid and usually the people married within
their castes. According to him, ‘Relations whether by
the father’s or mother’s side do not inter marry.’ The
accursed purdah-system did not exist but the practice
of sati was, however, practiced by the people. Harsha’s
own mother Yasomati died as a sati.
The chief occupation of the people was cultivation
of land, domesticating animals, adopting various other 
occupations including industries, trade and commerce.
Trade was carried on both by sea and land-routes
with many neighbouring countries, such as China
and Persia. The medium of exchange comprised not
merely gold and silver coins, but also cowries and
small pearls.
        </li>
        <li>

        <b>Religious Condition:</b> Hieun-Tsang was a religious
pilgrim and so he wrote in detail about the religious
condition of India in the fi rst half of the seventh
century A.D. There were three religions-Hinduism,
Buddhism and Jainism that were fl ourishing side
by side in India in the seventh century A.D. About
Buddhism, Hieun-Tsang nowhere writes that it was
on the decline, but from his account that ancient
seats of Buddhism like Gaya and Kapilvastu were
ruins, historians have derived the conclusion that
Buddhism was declining day by day. But still in
every big town there were many monasteries where
about 10,000 monks lived. There were many Indian
rulers (like Harsha) who patronized Buddhism. In
addition to the two main sects-the Hinayana and the
Mahayana-Buddhism had further been split up into
18 different sub-sects.
About Hinduism, Hieun-Tsang writes that it was
gaining strength. India was known in China as ‘the
country of the Brahmans.’ Hinduism had greatly
regained its superior status since the day of the Imperial Guptas. The predominance of Hinduism was
further demonstrated by the popularity of Sanskrit
which, according to Hieun-Tsang, had begun to be
commonly used both in speaking and writing. The
Buddhist teacher had also developed a great fondness
for this language of the gods.
Though Indian people followed different religions
according to their likings, yet they practiced complete
religious toleration. The followers of different faiths
lived peacefully. Harsha, no doubt, had become a
Buddhist, but he did not become a religious persecutor. While showering favours and distributing money,
he never made any distinction between a Buddhist
monk and a Brahman priest.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Educational System:</b> From Hieun-Tsang’s account,
we come to know that there was well-organised system
of education during the reign of Harsha. Elementary
education was given in temples and monasteries
where students resided with their teachers. The
higher education was provided by some well-known
centres of education which resembled more or less
the modern universities. Some of the well-known
universities then existing were those of Taxila, Ujjain,
Gaya and Nalanda.
The most important university was that of Nalanda which had its own six-storyed building. It
was a university of international fame and students
from various foreign countries usually came here
for study. There were about 1,510 Professors in all
who imparted knowledge to about 10,000 students.
No fees were charged from the students and even
food, accommodation and clothes were provided free
of cost to them. The expenditure of this university
was met by the rich donations made by many Indian
rulers and rich people. Moreover, about 100 villages
and their revenues were attached with this university
for meeting out its expenses. Harsha is also said to
have made rich endowments to this university. Such
a university perhaps did not exist any where else on
the surface of the world.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Harsha’s Assemblies:</b> Hieun-Tsang has given a vivid
description of Harsha’s assemblies. Harsha called a
special assembly at Kannauj to honour Heiun-Tsang
and to give wide publicity to the doctrines of the
Mahayana faith. In this assembly a heated discussion
took place between the Brahmans and Hieun-Tsang.
In the end, Hieun-Tsang won the day and a special
procession was organized to honour him on his success. Again Hieun-Tsang writes that Harsha used to
distribute alms among the learned, religious men, the
poor and the needy on a large scale. One of such assemblies was held in 643 A.D. which was attended by
Harsha himself. On the fi rst day, Harsha worshipped
Buddha, on the second day the image of Sun and on
the third day adoration was offered to Shiva.
After these adorations to various deities Harsha
began his work of distributing wealth and offering
gifts to the Buddhist monks, Brahman heretics, and
the poor, the orphans and the destitute. He exhausted
all his treasury so much so that he had to borrow his
personal clothes from his sister Rajyashri.
