<h3>Post Gupta Period in South India</h3>



From the middle of the sixth century A.D., the
history of South India is virtually the story of mutual
confl icts among three powers, each seeking constantly
to extend its empire at the expense of its neighbours.
This went on for about three hundred years. The three
powers were the Chalukyas of Badami, the Pallavas
of Kanchi and the Pandyas of Madurai.
All of them rose into prominence in the sixth century, but the Chalukyas quit the stage about a century
earlier than the two other powers, their place on the
political map being more or less exactly fi lled from
the middle of the eighth century by their successors,
the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta (Malkhed). Besides
the main house of Badami, the Chalukyas established
themselves in two other branches, more or less independent of the main line: the Chalukyas of Lata and
the Eastern Chalukyas of Vengi. Together with the
Gangas of Mysore, the Eastern Chalukyas took sides
in the confl icts of the three kingdoms, sometimes with
decisive results. The Cholas of the Tamil country had
practically disappeared except that a line of Telugu
rulers bearing their name and claiming a traditional
connection with their capital at Uraiyur ruled in the
area now known as Rayalaseema.
Political confl ict was, however, no obstacle to cultural growth. A vast and many-sided Hindu revival
checked the spread of Jainism and Buddhism, created
a great volume of soul-stirring devotional literature
and advanced philosophic speculations. Under the
stimulus of this religious impulse, remarkable advances were registered in architecture, sculpture,
painting and music. All these infl uences overfl owed
into the numerous Hindu colonies across the sea.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Imperial Cholas</i></strong></div>  

Vijayalaya Chola, who was probably a Pallava
Vassal, rose out of obscurity during the middle of
the 9th century C.E. Making use of the opportunity
during a war between Pandyas and Pallavas, Vijayalaya rose out of obscurity and captured Thanjavur
in 848 C.E.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sundara Chola</i></strong></div>  

The Chola power recovered during Sundara
Chola’s reign. The Chola Army under the command
of the crown prince Aditya Karikala defeated the
Pandyas and invaded up to Tondaimandalam in the
north. Uttama, son of the previous Chola king Gandaraditya forced Sundara Chola to declare him heir
apparent. Uttama Chola’s reign was conspicuous for
the lack of any major initiatives and he was replaced
by the great Rajaraja Chola in 985 C.E.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rajaraj Chola</i></strong></div> 

Although the early Chola monarchs had captured
parts of Tondai-nadu, Kongu-nadu and Pandi-nadu,
the empire had shrunk to the area around the Kaveri
Delta in the year 985, when the 7th Chola monarch, Rajaraja, born Arulmolivarman, assumed the throne.
Rajaraja immediately embarked on a campaign of
territorial expansion and captured Pallava and Pandya
territory. He successfully fought the Chera rulers of
Kerala and extended his rule over parts of modern
Karnataka. He captured the island of Sri Lanka as
a province of the Chola empire; it remained under
direct Chola rule for 75 years. Rajaraja built temples
in his own name in all these areas. He conquered the
Maldive Islands in the Indian Ocean and sent missions
to the Indonesian Shrivijaya empire. He encouraged
the Shailendra monarch of Java to build a Buddhist
monastery at the Chola port of Nagapattinam.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rajendra Chola</i></strong></div> 

Rajaraja’s son Rajendra (r. 1012-1044) further consolidated Chola power. He created a Chola viceroyalty
in Madurai, appointing his son as the fi rst CholaPandya viceregal prince. Rajendra next attacked the
Western Chalukyas and their allies. Rajendra’s reign
was marked by his expedition to the river Ganges
(c. 1019 C.E.). The Chola army dashed through the
kingdoms north of Vengi and engaged the Pala king
Mahipala and defeated him. The victorious Chola
army returned with the waters of the holy Ganges.
In a series of campaigns he marched to north as to
the river Ganga (Ganges). He brought back some of
its sacred water in golden pots, emptied these into
into a tank named Chola-ganga and adopted the title
of Gangai-konda (Capturer of the Ganges). However,
he did not assume control over the Ganges region.
The relationship with Shrivijaya deteriorated to the
point that Rajendra sent a naval expedition against
the kingdom in order to enforce acknowledgement
of Chola suzerainty. He sent two diplomatic missions to China.
In 1070, after three of Rajendra’s sons and one
grandson had succeeded him, a new line of ChalukyaCholas was established when the Eastern Chalukya
prince Rajendra II (r. 1070-1125) ascended the throne.
His mother and grandmother were Chola princesses.
Rajendra II assumed the title of Kulottunga (Star of
the Dynasty). During his reign, Sri Lanka gained
independence from the Chola rule. However, trade
fl ourished with Southeast Asia. Another Chola embassy was sent to China, together with 72 merchants.
Trade with Shrivijaya was active too. The reign of
Rajendra II was one of peace and prosperity.
The Chola empire held together well until the
end of the reign of Kulottunga III in 1216. However,
it was not as extensive as in the days of Rajaraja I
and Rajendra I.
As the Pandya monarchs to the south increased in
strength and a group of feudatory chieftains aggressively pursued power in the 13th century, the Chola
Empire shrank to the region around Thanjavur. The
Chola dynasty came to an end in 1279 when Rajaraja
III died and the Chola territory was easily absorbed
into Pandya rule.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chola Chalukya Wars</i></strong></div>  

The History of Cholas from the period of Rajaraja
was tinged with a series of confl icts with the Western
Chalukyas. The Old Chalukya dynasty had split in
to two sibling dynasties of the Western and Eastern
Chalukyas. Rajaraja’s daughter Kundavai was married to the Eastern Chalukya prince Vimaladitya.
Stemming from this Cholas had a fi lial interest in
the affairs of Vengi. Western Chalukyas however
felt that the Vengi kingdom was under their natural
sphere of infl uence. Several wars were fought and
neither could claim mastery over the other. Cholas
never managed to overwhelm the Kalyani kingdom
and the frontier remained at the Tungabhadra River.
These wars however resulted in a lot of bloodshed
and the death of at least one monarch (Rajadhiraja
Chola).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Administration</i></strong></div> 

The whole empire was divided into
‘Mandalam’(province) and these in turn into’Valanadu’
or Kottam and Nadu. Village was the basic unit of
administration. The cholas are best known for their
local self-government at village level. Each village had
an assembly to look after the affairs of the village.
The general assemblies were of three types:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Ur- a general assembly of the village consisting of
tax paying residents.</li>
        <li>Sabha or Mahasabha – consisted of a gathering
of the adult men in the Brahmana villages called
‘Brahmadeya’ and agarhara village granted to
the Brahmanas and of the and was restricted to the
Brahmans of the villages.</li>
        <li>Nagaram was found in trading centres alone.
The ‘Uttaramerur’ inscription (10th Century)
describes how the local Sabha functioned. There
was a close contact between the Central authority
and the village assemblies. The Chola officials had
only a supervisory role over these assemblies. The
Mahasabha possessed the proprietary rights over
community lands and controlled the private lands
within its jurisdiction. The judicial committee of the
Mahasabha, called the ‘nattar’ settled both civil and
criminal cases of dispute.
Famous committees of the Mahasabha:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Variyam: Executive Committee of Sabha</li>
        <li>Tottavariyam: Garden committee</li>
        <li>Pon-Variyam: Gold committee</li>
        <li>Eri-Variyam: Tank Committee</li>
        <li>Alunganattar: Executive Committee of Ur</li>
        <li>Nyayattar: Judicial Committee</li>
        <li>Udasin-Variyam: Committee of Ascetics</li>
        <li>Samstua-Variyam: Annual Committee</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chalukyas of Vatapi/ Badami</i></strong></div>  

This dynasty rose to power in the Deccan from
the 5th to the 8th century AD and again from the
10th to the 12th century AD. They ruled over the
area between the Vindhyachal and the Krishna River.
The Chalukyas were the arch enemies of the Pallavas,
another famous dynasty of the south.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pulakesin I</i></strong></div>  

A prominent ruler of the Chalukya dynasty was
Pulakesin I. He founded the city of Vatapi (modern
Badami in Bijapur district of Karnataka) and made it
his capital. He is said to have performed Ashwamedha
Yagna to attain supremacy as a ruler. The kingdom
was further extended by his sons Kirtivarman and
Mangalesa who waged many wars against the Mauryan rulers of the neighbouring Konkan region.
The best known specimens of Chalukyan art are
the Virupaksha temple, (built by Queen Lokamahadevi
in 740 AD to commemorate her husband’s victory
over the Pallavas), and the Mallikarjuna temple both
at Pattadakal, Karnataka.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pulakesin II</i></strong></div>

Pulakesin II, son of Kirtivarman was the greatest
ruler of the Chalukya dynasty, who ruled for almost
34 years. During his long reign, he consolidated his
powers in Maharashtra and conquered parts of the
Deccan stretching from the banks of the Narmada to
the region beyond the Kaveri. His greatest achievement was his victory in the 
defensive war against Harshavardhan (A north Indian emperor with his
capital at Kannauj) in the year 620 AD. In 641 AD,
the Chinese pilgrim Hiuen Tsang, visited the kingdom and paid glowing tributes to the king for his
efficient and just rule.
Pulakesin II was defeated and killed by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman in 642 AD. His capital
Vatapi was completely destroyed. Pulakesin was
succeeded by his son Vikramaditya who was also a
noble and just ruler. He renewed the struggle against
his enemies and managed to restore the former glory
of his dynasty to a certain extent. The Chalukyas
were ousted by a chieftain Dantidurga, who laid the
foundation of Rashtrakuta dynasty.
Considered the greatest of the Chalukya rulers
of Badami not only because of the problems he had
to face while coming to the throne, but also because
of his subsequent military as well as diplomatic
achievements.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>He had to wage civil war against his uncle,
Mangalesa, who refused to hand over the power.</li>
        <li>Though Pulakesin succeeded in defeating and
killing his uncle, this civil war shook the young
kingdom and rebellions began to appear on all
sides. But he was quite successful in the suppression
of these rebellions. He defeated the rebel feudatory,
Appayika, and pardoned his confederate, Govinda,
when the latter offered his submission.</li>
        <li>Establishment of his suzerainty over the neighbours
such as Kadambas of Banavasi, the Alupas of
south Kanara, the Gangas of Mysore, and the
Mauryas of north Konkan. Apart from the above
rulers, the Latas, Malwas and Gurjaras also offered
their submission to him because of their fear of
Harshavardhana of Kanuaj.</li>
        <li>His clash with Harsha, in which he was able to
check Harsha’s design to conquer the Deccan.</li>
        <li>Conquests in the eastern Deccan-southern Kosala,
Kalinga, Pistapura and the Banas of Rayalaseema
offered their submission after their defeat at the
hands of Pulakesin.</li>
        <li>Conflict with the Pallavas of Kanchi-his first
expedition against the Pallav kingdom, which was
then ruled by Mahendravarman I was a complete
success, and he annexed the northern part of the
Pallava kingdom. But his second expedition against
the Pallavas, however, ended in complete disaster
for himself as well as his own kingdom. The then
Pallava ruler, Narasimhavarman I, who succeeded
Mahendraverman, not only drove back Chalukya
armies, but also invaded the Chalukya kingdom,
killed Pulakesin II and captured Badami.</li>
        <li>Diplomatic achievement-he sent an embassy to
the Persian king, Khusrau II, in AD 625 and also
received one from him. The reception given to the
Persian mission is, in fact, depicted in one of the
famous Ajanta cave paintings.</li>
        <li>Visit of Hiuen Tsang – the description given by
this Chinese pilgrim of the kingdom of Pulakesin
is quite useful in knowing the social and economic
conditions under the Chalukya rulers of Badami.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chalukyas of Kalyani</i></strong></div>  

Another branch of the Chalukyas established their
supremacy under their ruler Tailpa II (973-997 A.D.),
who was probably a feudatory of the Rastrakutas.
He fought successful wars against the Latas of Gujarat, Kalchuries of Chedi, Parmars of Malwa and the
Cholas of the South. The Parmara ruler Munja died
fi ghting him. Tailpa II died in about 997 A.D. His
two immediate successors Satyasraya (997-1008 A.D.)
and Vikramaditya V (1001-1016), however, suffered
defeats at the hands of Rajaraja Chola and Bhoja Parmara respectively. The next Chalukya ruler Jayasimha
II (1016-1042 A.D.) routed Bhoja Parmara but was in
turn defeated by the Chola ruler Rajendra Chola I at
the battle of Musangi. It was Somesvara who laid the
foundation of a new town of Kalyani which henceforth
became the capital of the Chalukyas. Vikramaditya VI
won a great name for his dynasty by his allround conquests and cultural activities. He defeated the Hoyasala
King (Vishnuvardhana) of Mysore and Rajendra Chola
II and recovered some of the lost territories of his
dynasty. The famous poet Bilhana and Vigyanesvara,
the author of the well known work “Mitakshara”
fl ourished during his reign. After Vikramaditya VI’s
death in about 1126 A.D. the Chalukya power began to
decline rapidly. Many feudatory chiefs asserted their
independence and in about 1190 A.D. Somesvara IV,
the last ruler of this dynasty, was overthrown by the
Yadavas of Devagiri.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contribution of the Chalukyas</i></strong></div>  

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Art and Architecture</i></strong></div>  

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>They developed the Deccan or Vesara style in the
building of structural temples, which reached
culmination, however, only under the Rashtrakutas
and the Hoyasalas.</li>
        <li>It was the Chalukyas who perfected the art of
stone building, that is, stones fi nely joined without
mortar.</li>
        <li>Under their auspices, the Buddhists, the Jainas
and the Brahmins competed with each other in
building cave temples.</li>
        <li>Though the cave frescoes began earlier, some
of the fi nest specimens belonged to the Chalukya era.
The murals that were executed on the walls dealt
with not only religious themes but also with secular
ones. In the fi rst monastic hall at Ajanta, we notice
a painting depicting the reception given to a Persian
embassy by Pulakesin II.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Temples:</b> The temple-building activity under the
Chalukyas of Badami can be broadly divided into two
stages. The fi rst stage is represented by the temples
at Aihole and Badami. Aihole is a town of temples
and contains no fewer than 70 structures, of which
four are noteworthy.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Ladh Khan temple is a fl at roofed building.</li>
        <li>Durga temple was an experiment seeking to adopt
the Buddhist chaitya to a Brahmanical temple.</li>
        <li>Hucimaligudi is very similar to the Durga temple,
but smaller than it.</li>
        <li>The Jaina temple of Meguti shows some progress
in the erection of structural temples, but it is
unfinished.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


Of the temples at Badami, the Melagitti Sivalaya
is a small but fi nely proportioned and magnifi cently
located temple. A group of four rock-cut halls at
Badami (three of them Hindu and one Jaina) are
all of the same type. The workmanship in the caves
is marked by a high degree of technical excellence.
Though the front is very unassuming, the interior is
treated with great skill and care in every detail.
The second stage is represented by the temples at
Pattadakal. There are about ten temples here, four in
the northern style and six in the southern style. In
the Deccan both styles were used. There was even a
tendency to combine the feature of the two styles.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Papanatha temple is the most notable among
the temples of the northern style, it also reveals
attempts to combine northern and southern
features in one structure.</li>
        <li>The Virupaksha temple was built by one of the
queens of Vikramaditya II. Workmen brought from
Kanchi were employed in its construction. Hence
it is a direct imitation of the Kailasanatha temple
which had come into existence in Kanchi some
decades earlier.</li>
        <li>The Sangamesvara temple, which was built some
years before the above one, is more or less in the
same style.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pallavas of Kanchi</i></strong></div>  

The Pallavas were the first well-known dynasty
which came into power in the South after the fall of
the Andharas. But nothing defi nite is known about
their origin. For about two hundred years from 550
to 750 A.D., the Pallavas were the dominant power
in the South. Their rule extended over a vast region
including the modern territories of Madras, Arcot,
Trichnopoly and Tanjore but the whole of the South
was under their infl uence. There were several branches
of these Pallavas who ruled form different quarters
such as Badami or Vatapi, Ellora and Kanchi. The
most powerful dynasty of the Pallavas was the one
which had its capital at Kanchi. The earliest Pallava
ruler about whom we have some reliable information was Vishnugopa of Kanchi. With Simha Vishnu
(575-600 A.D.) begins the most glorious epoch of the
Pallava history. He is said to have defeated rulers of
the three Tamil States of Cheras, Cholas and Pandyas
and also the ruler of Ceylon. Mahendra Varman (600-
625 A.D.) had to fi ght a deadly and long drawn battle
with the Chalukyas. Mahendra Varman was a great
patron of art and literature. Formerly he was a Jain by
faith but later on he was converted to Shaivism and
then he built a large number of rock cut temples at
various places (Dalavanur, Pallavaram, Vallam, etc.)
in honour of Shiva, Vishnu and Brahma. Mahendra
Varman was succeeded by his son Narasimha Varman
(625-645 A.D.) in about 625 A.D. He is perhaps the
most important ruler of the Pallava dynasty. He defeated the Chalukya ruler Pulakesin II in about 642
A.D. and took hold of his capital Badami or Vatapi.
He also fought successful wars against the Cheras,
Cholas and the king of Ceylon. It was during his
reign, that the celebrated Chinese pilgrim Hieun-Tsang
visited Kanchi in about 642 A.D. and stayed there for
sometime. Narsimha Varman was a great builder like
his father. He built many rock-cut temples and laid
the foundation of a new city, which was known as
Mahabalipuram. He beautifi ed this city with many
wonderful shrines, the chief among them was the
Dharmaraja Ratha.
After the death of Narsimha Varman in about 645
A.D. the Pallava empire began to fall with a rapid
speed. The successors of Narasimha Varman continued their rule upto the end of 9th century A.D. when
under Aparajita Varman (876-895 A.D.) their territory
was annexed by the Cholas in about 895 A.D.
The Pallavas with their capital at Kanchipuram
were a hereditary Hindu dynasty. They ruled between
the 4th and the 9th Century. Under the Pallavas, their
vast kingdom was exposed to increased infl uence of
Sanskrit and the culture associated with it. During this
period the cults of Shavism and Vaishnavism became
deeply embedded in the Tamilian culture.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Art and Architecture</i></strong></div>  

The development of temple architecture, particularly Dravida style, under the Pallavas can be seen
in four stages.
<div>
<b>Mahendra Group:</b> The influence of the cave style
of architecture is to be seen in this group. Examples;
are the rock-cut temples at Bhairavakonda (North
Arcot district), and Anantesvara temple at Undavalli
(Guntur district).</div>
<div>
<b>Narasimha Group:</b> They comprise the rathas or
monolithic temples, each of which is hewn out of a
single rock-boulder. These monolithic temples are
found at Mamallapuram. The rathas, popularly called
the Seven Pagodas, are actually eight in number.
They are (1) Dharmaraja, (2) Bhima, (3) Arjuna, (4)
Sahadeva, (5) Draupadi, (6) Ganesa, (7) Pidari and
(8) Valaiyankuttai.</div>
<div>
<b>Rajasimha Group:</b> There are fi ve examples of this
group – at Mahabalipuram (Shore, Isvara and Mukunda temples), one at Panamalai in South Arcot, and
the Kailasanatha temple at Kanchi. Among all these,
the most mature example is the last one.</div>

<div>
<b>Nandivarman Group:</b> This group mostly consists of small temples except the Vaikunthaperumal
temple at Kanchi and in no way forms an advance
on the achievements of the previous age. But they
are more ornate, resembling the Chola architecture.
The best examples are the temples of Muktesvara
and Matangesvara at Kanchi, the Vadamalisvara at
Orgadam (near Chingalput), and the Parasuramesvara
at Gudimallam (near Renigunta).
The Pallavas also contributed to the development
of sculpture in south India. The Pallava sculpture
largely is indebted to the Buddhist tradition. It is
more monumental and linear in form, thus avoiding
the typical ornamentation of the Deccan sculpture.
The best example is the ‘Descent of the Ganga’ or
‘Arjuna’s Penance’ at Mahabalipuram.</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religion</i></strong></div>  

The Pallavas were orthodox Brahmanical Hindus
and their patronage was responsible for the great
reformation of the medieval ages. Most of the Pallava
kings were devotees of Shiva, the exceptions being
Simhavishnu and Nandivarman who were worshippers of Vishnu. Mahendravarman I was the fi rst to
be infl uenced by the famous Saivite saints of the age.
Besides worshipping Siva, he also showed reverence
to other Hindu gods. Pallavas were tolerant towards
other religions like Buddhism and Jainism. However,
some of the sects like Buddhism were losing their
former glory to Saivism. The Vedic tradition in general
bossed over the local tradition. Sankaracharya in fact
gave this stimulus to Vedic tradition.
Tamil saints of the sixth and seventh centuries
AD were the progenitors of the bhakti movement.
The hymns and sermons of the Nayanars (Saivite
saints) and Alvars (Vaishnavite saints) continued
the tradition of bhakti. Saivite saints were Appar,
Sambandar, Sundarar, and others. Most remarkable
thing about this age was the presence of women
saints such as Andal (an Alvar).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Education and Learning</i></strong></div> 

Education in the early days was controlled by the
Jainas and Buddhists. The Jaina institutions were located at Madurai and Kanchi. But soon Brahmanical
institutions superseded them. Ghatikas or Brahmin
institutions were attached to the temples and mostly
confi ned to advance study. In the eighth century AD
the maths also became popular. A math was an omnibus institution because of its being a rest-house, a
feeding centre and also an education centre. In all these
institutions, Sanskrit was the medium of instruction,
because it was also the offi cial language.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Early Pandya Kingdom</i></strong></div> 

The Pandya kingdom started its career about the
same times as the Pallava or a little later, but we
know little of the history of its fi rst two monarchs,
Kadungon (560-90) and his son Maravarman Avanisulamani (590-620). There is no doubt, however, that
they put an end to Kalabhra rule in their part of the
country and revived the Pandyan power. The third,
Sendan or Jayanta Varman, imposed his rule on the
Chera country and adopted the title of Vanavan. The
rock-cut cave temple at Malaiyadikurichi in Tirunelveli
district was excavated by him. His son was Arikesari
Parankusa Maravarman (650-700), whose inscription
has been recently found in the Vaigai bed at Madurai,
which points to his long and prosperous rule. He
is identical with Nedumaran, the victor of Nelveli,
celebrated in Tamil literature.
A great soldier, he fought many battles for the
extension of Pandya power, among which his conquest
of Nelveli is specially mentioned in epigraphs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political History</i></strong></div> 

Arikesari Parankusa was succeeded by his son
Koccadaiyan, also called Ranadhira (c. 700-30). This
monarch waged aggressive wars against his neighbours and extended the Pandya power into the Kongu
country. He also suppressed a revolt of the mountain
chieftain Ay who occupied the hilly country between
Tirunelveli and Travancore. His reign ended about
730, and his son Maravarman Rajasimha I succeeded
him. Early in his reign Rajasimha formed an alliance
with Chalukya Vikramaditya II, espoused the cause of
Chitramaya, and after infl icting a number of defeats on
Nandi Varman Pallavamalla besieged him in a place
called Nandigram, i.e., Nandi-puram, near Kumbakonam. The able Pallava general Udayachandra, who
encountered the Pandya forces in many battles, raised
the siege of Nandigrams, beheaded Chitramaya, and
thus made the Pallava throne secure for his monarch.
He also dealt with other enemies of Pallavamalla like
the Sabara king Udayana and the Nishada chieftain
Prithivivyaghra who were probably acting in collusion with the Chalukya, Vikramaditya II.
Rajasimha I was succeeded by Nedunjadaiyan,
popularly known as Varaguna Maharaja I, in the year
765 A.D. He gave a crushing defeat to Pallava ruler
Nandi Varman II and his allies. He had the credit
to annex the whole of the Kongn country. He also
defeated Adigaiman of Tagadur or Dharmapuri and
sent him into confi nement at Madura. He fi xed his
camp at Idavai in the heart of the Pallava kingdom.
Varaguna I had still other successes to his credit.
He led an expedition into Venad, South Travancore,
attacked the strongly fortified port of Vilinam and
brought the country under his rule.
He also waged successful war against the Ay
chieftain of the intervening mountainous country who
had perhaps been friendly to the ruler of Venad. As
a result of these wars, Pandya sway extended well
beyond Tiruchirapalli into the Tanjore, Salem and
Coimbatore districts, and all that lay South was under him. The expansion continued under his son and
successor Srimarra Srivallabha (815-62) who invaded
Ceylon in the reign of Sena I (831-51), ravaged the
Northern province and sacked the capital. Eventually
Sena made terms with the conqueror and the Pandya
forces quit the island. Srimara had next to deal with
a formidable combination formed against him again
under the leadership of the Pallavas. But he was
defeated on the bank of the River Arisil.
Srimara’s defeat at Arisil was, however, not an
isolated event. His aggressive campaigns which
had earned for him the title Parachakrakolahala
(Cofounder of the Circle of his Enemies) naturally
roused the hostility of his neighbours. Sena II (851-
855) of Ceylon, nephew and successor of Sena I,
had allied himself with the Pallavas and a Pandya
prince who sought his aid. This prince was probably
Srimara’s son whose claim to the throne had been
overlooked when his step-brother Viranarayana was
made yuvaraja (c.860). Sena sent an expedition into
the Madura kingdom at about the same time as the
battle of Arisil and the invasion was a complete
success. The capital was sacked, Srimmara died of
his wounds, and his son Varaguna Varman II was
enthroned in his place by the Simhalese commander
in chief (862). Varguna II had to acknowledge the
overlordship of Nripatunga.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vijaynagara Empire</i></strong></div> 

This was the most famous empire in the history
of southern India. The Vijayanagara empire lasted for
three centuries, thus indirectly checking the expansion
of Islamic powers in the region. According to legends
as well as historical sources, two brothers named
Harihara and Bukka (Sons of Sangama, a chieftain
at the court of the Hoysala rulers) had founded city
of Vijayanagara on the southern bank of the river
Tungabhadra in the state of Andhra Pradesh. Two
famous sages Madhav Vidyaranya and his brother
Sayana became the main source of inspiration for the
foundation of a Hindu empire in the region.
Harihar became the fi rst king of the newly founded
empire. After his death Bukka succeded him. Bukka
sent an emissary to China in 1374 as a diplomatic
move. After Bukka’s death, Harihara II (son of Harihar) ascended the throne. He expanded his domains
by conquering almost the whole of southern India,
including Mysore, Kanara, Chingalpet, Trichinopally
and Kanchivaram (modern Kanchipuram). A staunch
worshipper of Lord Shiva, Harihara II was fairly
tolerant towards the followers of other faiths too. He
became the fi rst king of the Vijayanagara empire to
assume the title of Maharajadhiraj Rajaparmeshwara
(the mighty, sovereign, king of kings).
In 1486, Vir Narasimha of Chandragiri, (who belonged to the Tuluva dynasty) took over the reigns
of the Vijaynagar empire. His son Krishanadev Raya
has been acclaimed the greatest ruler of Vijayanagara
and one of the most famous kings in the history of
India. A great warrior, he almost invariably won
the wars which he waged throughout his period of
kingship. He was known to have treated even his
vanquished foes with honour.
During the period 1511-1514, he captured southern
Mysore, Shivasamudram fortress and Raichur (Karnataka), defeated Gajapati, the erstwhile king of Orissa
and captured Udaigiri (Orissa), in that order. Still
later, he captured Vishakhapatnam and abolished the
authority of the rulers of Orissa. His most outstanding achievement was the defeat infl icted on one of
the Bahamani rulers, Ismail Adil Shah on 19th March
1520. This landmark event put an end to the Muslim
dominance in the southern part of the country.
During his later years, Krishnadeva Raya strongly
focused on the organization of his empire and improving its administration. In order to maintain friendly
relations with foreign powers (who were beginning
to gain a foothold in India) particularly the Portuguese, he granted some concessions to the Portuguese
governor Alphonsde de Albuquerque.
The reign of Krishanadev Raya also witnessed
tremendous growth and development in the spheres
of literature, music, art and culture. Raya himself
was an accomplished poet, musician, scholar and extremely well-versed in Sanskrit, Telugu and Kannada.
He patronized many poets and authors notably the
Ashtadiggajas (literally: poets of a gigantic stature)
of Telugu language.
The famous scholar and wit Tenali Rama adorned
his court. During this period there was also a spurt
in art and architecture. The famous Vithalswami
temple and the Hazara temple (literally a thousand)
both at Hampi built during his reign are magnifi cent
specimens of Hindu Temple architecture, executed in
the Vijaynagar style of architecture.
The Vijayanagar empire witnessed the arrival of
European traders (especially the Portuguese) in India.
Krishnadeva Raya encouraged foreign trade which
necessitated the use of currency. The coins of the Vijayanagara Empire were chiefl y made with gold and
copper. Most of the gold coins carried a sacred image
on one side and the royal legend on the reverse. Some
gold coins bore the images of Lord Tirupatis.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bahamani Kingdom</i></strong></div>  

According to historical records, a rebel chieftain
of Daulatabad, near Ellora, Maharashtra, which
was under Muhammad Bin Tughalaq, founded the
Bahamani kingdom. This chieftain, Allauddin Hassan, who was a man of humble origins, assumed
the name of Gangu Bahamani, in memory of his
Brahmin mentor. His kingdom comprised parts of
present day Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Andhra
Pradesh. South of his kingdom lay the Vijayanagara
Empire against which it had to fi ght continuous wars
for political reasons.
The most remarkable ruler of the Bahamani
kingdom was Firuz Shah Bahamani (1397-1422
AD), who fought three major battles against the
Vijayanagara Empire without any tangible results.
He was a great scholar, well-versed in religious and
natural sciences. He wanted to make the Deccan the
cultural centre of India.
According to his court poet Ferhishta, Firuz Shah
was a true Muslim in spirit, notwithstanding his
vices - fondness for wine and music, both strictly
forbidden by Islam. Firuz Shah was compelled to
abdicate in favour of his brother Ahmad Shah I, who
successfully invaded Warangal and annexed most
part of it to his empire. The conquest of Warangal
proved to be a shot in the arm of the Bahamanis.
The kingdom gradually expanded and reached its
zenith under the prime ministership of Mahmud
Gawan (1466-1481 AD).
Mahmud Gawan arrived and settled down in
Bidar from Persia in the year 1453. A great scholar
of Islamic cultural traditions, he established and
funded a Madarassa (college) which was modelled
along the lines of the universities of Samarkand and
Khorasan (both in Central Asia).
One of the major problems faced by Gawan was
the unending dispute among the Bahamani nobles,
who were divided into Deccanis (old timers) and
Afaqis or Gharibs (newcomers).
Since Gawan himself was a newcomer (of Persian
origin), he failed to win the confi dence of the Deccanis.
His policy of conciliation failed to stem the ongoing
strife amongst the noblemen. In 1482, Gawan,a septugenarian was executed by Sultan Muhammad Shah,
the last ruler of the undivided Bahamani Empire.
After Gawan’s death, the raging internal factions
grew more intense and various governors declared
their independence. The kingdom fi nally got fragmented into fi ve parts--- the Adil Shahis of Bijapur,
the Qutub Shahis of Golconda, the Nizam Shahis of
Ahmednagar, the Barid Shahi of Bidar and lastly the
Imad Shahis of Berar.
The fi ve kingdoms came together to wage a war
against the mighty Vijayanagara Empire and infl icted
a death-blow to it in 1565. A few years down the
line, the Imad Shahi kingdom was conquered by
Nizamshahis in 1574 AD; the Barid Shahi kingdom
was annexed by Adil Shahis in 1619 AD.

These kingdoms continued to play a dominant role
in the politics of the region till they were eventually
merged in the Mughal empire in the 17th century.
After the death of Shivaji, Aurangzeb, the Mughal
emperor, marched southwards, fi nally annexing Bijapur in 1686 A.D and Golconda in 1689 A. D; this
sounded the death knell of the Bahamani kingdom.
The Bahamani period witnessed the upsurge of
secularism and communal harmony. Hazrat Banda
Nawaz (1321-1422 A.D) the great Sufi saint was patronized by the Bahamani kings and his Dargah located
at Gulbarga in Karnataka, is a famous pilgrimage for
both Hindus and Muslims alike.
 In the fi eld of architecture, the Bahamani rulers
evolved a distinct style by drawing heavily from
Persian, Turkey, and Arabic architectural styles and
blending it with local styles. One of the largest and
most famous domes in the world, the Gol Gumbaz
at Bijapur and the majestic gateway Charminar at
Hyderabad and the Golconda Fort near Hyderabad
are the hallmarks of Bahamani architecture. The main
source of income of the Bahamanis was the cultivated
land, with the administration revolving around the
assessment and collection of land revenue.
The Bahmanis of the Deccan ultimately left behind
a rich, composite cultural heritage of Indo-Islamic art,
language, besides Islamic faith and traditions.
