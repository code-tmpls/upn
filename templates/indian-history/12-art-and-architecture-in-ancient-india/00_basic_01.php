<h3>Art and Architecture in Ancient India</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Art of sculpture</i></strong></div>  

Ancient India witnessed remarkable progress in
the art of sculpture. The three important schools
namely- Gandhara, Mathura and Amravati grew
and progressed during ancient India. Each of these
schools has occupied a commanding place in the fi eld
of Indian sculpture and has contributed towards its
growth and fulfilment.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gandhara School</i></strong></div>  

The Gandhara Art (50 B.C. - 500 A.D.) has been
called by several other names, i.e., Greeco-Roman,
Greeco-Buddhist, Indo-Greek etc., because it clearly
exhibits the infl uence of Roman, Greek or Hellenistic
art. The patrons of this art were not the Greeks but
the Shakas and the Kushanas, who carried on and
protected the traditions and culture of their Hellenistic
predecessors in this region. The art fl ourished in the
North Western frontier of India, the region called the
Gandhara Pradesh and therefore, it has been named
as the Gandhara School of Art. And as the Hellenistic
infl uence on this art is undeniable, it has been called
the Greeco-Roman or Indo-Greek Art. Besides as it
was inspired by Buddhism, it has also been called
Greeco-Buddhist Art. Thus the impression of this art
was primarily Buddhism and its creators were mostly
Indians, though it was infl uenced by foreign art.
The art pieces of Gandhara School have been
found at Bimaran, Hastnagar, Sakra Dheri, Shah-ji
ki dheri, and at the various sites of Taxila. Most of
them have been kept in the museum of Peshawar
and Lahore. Amongst these art pieces the image
of the Buddha are the best specimens. The other
earliest specimens are the headless standing image
of Buddha and standing Hariti figure. They were
executed in stone, stucco, terracotta and other types
of day, and appear to have been invariably embellished with gold leaf or paint.
Viewing them from a critical point, it is concluded
that the Gandhara School progressed during 150 years
of its beginning; it deteriorated in the second century
A.D. In its later stage it was affected by the Mathura
school and, when finally grown up, it affected the
art of sculpture in China and Central Asia. Its chief
characteristic is the realistic representation of human
figures, distinguished muscles of the body and transparent garments. It is marked by the representation of
thick drapery with large and bold foldings. It is also
known for rich carving, elaborate ornamentation and
complex symbolism. The images of the Buddha were
so beautifully made that they look like the image of
Apollo, the Greek god of beauty.
Now the majority of the scholars believe that the
Mathura School stands higher than the Gandhara
School and that it was free from the infl uence of
Gandhara Art. Yet the Gandhara School of art has
been recognised as one of the best school of Indian
sculpture and the images of the Buddha which were
built under its patronage are among the best possessions of Indian art. Dr. A.L. Basham comments “The
Buddhas of Gandhara School though perhaps lacking
in the spirituality of those of the Gupta period, are
gentle, graceful and compassionate, while some of
the plaques are vivid and energetic.”

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mathura School</i></strong></div>  

The school of art that developed at Mathura (U.P.)
has been called the Mathura School (150-300 A.D.).
Its origin has been traced back to the middle of the
second century B.C., but it was only in first century
A.D. that its genuine progress began. It fl ourished
here for centuries and acquired the highest position
in the fi eld of sculpture. It was so popular that at a
later stage the images, which were built here, were
exported to Taxila and even Central Asia in the
West and to Shravasti and Sarnath in the East. It
also provided the basis for further progress of the
art of sculpture. The art of sculpture of the Gupta
Age, has been accepted as a developed form of the
Mathura School. The Mathura School was somewhat
influenced by the Gandhara School in the first half
of second century A.D. The images of the Buddha of
the Gandhara Art were copied here but in a more
refined way. The Gandhara composition is also evident in certain reliefs and decorative motifs. In turn,
it also infl uenced the Gandhara School of art. The
school was directly infl uenced by Roman art as well
because of its direct links with the Roman Empire
by sea route. But whatever foreign infl uence it had,
it was slowly given up by the coming of the Gupta
Age. It was perfectly free from it.
A standing female figure of Amohini, the standing
statue of Kanishka kept in the museum of Mathura,
the statue of a slave girl kept in the museum of
Benaras and a large member of figures and images
in stone of the Buddha and Boddhisattavas, Yakshas
and Yakshinis, males and females found at Mathura
and its nearby region, have been regarded as the fi nest piece of the art of sculpture. In the early stages
the school was inspired by Jainism. Afterwards the
images of the Buddha replaced them, which clearly
exhibits the infl uence of Buddhism on it. Not only
were statues of emperors prepared by sculpture, but
the great majority of their creation consisted of nude
or seminude figures of female Yakshinis or apsaras in
erotic attitudes. The Mathura artists also carved out
images of Brahmanical divinities. Popular Brahmanical
gods, Shiva and Vishnu were represented alone and
sometimes with their consorts, Parwati and Laxmi
respectively. Images of many other Brahmanical deities
like Brahma, Surya, Balram, Agni, Kartikeya, Kubera
etc. were also executed in stone. The distinguishing
feature of the Mathura School was that the stone
which the craftsman used was mostly spotted red
sandstone found at Fatehpur Sikri near Agra.
The royal statue of Kushana kings were found near
Mathura exhibit foreign infl uence. The most striking
statue is that of emperor Kanishka, though it lacks
its head. It is drapped in the dress of central Asia,
a long coat and quilted boots. It is grand and solid
from the physical point of view, though technically
it lacks a sense of depth. The same way, the early
Buddha and Bodhisattavas of Mathura School are
fleshy figures and possess no expression of spirituality. But, afterwards, religious feeling and spirituality
were exhibited in them. Then the images exhibited
not only a firm, masculine and energetic body, but
also one with grace and religious feeling. The attempt
to display spiritual strength by a circle behind the
faces to the images began with Mathura School. Yet
the most remarkable piece of the Mathura Art are
its beautiful female figures. Most of these figures
are nude or semi nude, have full round breasts, full
heavy lips and slender waists. Besides, posture of
their body, head and hands and legs are defi nitely
erotic. Thus, their aim is frankly sensual.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Amravati School</i></strong></div>  

In the region between the lower valley of the rivers
Krishna and Godavari in the South are the districts
of Amravati and Guntur where another school of
sculpture called the Amravati School (150-400 A.D.)
fl ourished. The region had become an important
centre of Buddhism as early as 2nd century B.C. and
it provided the first incentive to this school. By the
middle of the 2nd century A.D. the school matured
itself and beautiful sculptural pieces were created. The
school exerted great infl uence not only on the later
South Indian sculpture but as its productives were
carried to Ceylon and South-East Asian countries, it
also infl uenced sculptural art of those countries. The
Amravati School serves as a link between the earlier
arts of Bharhut, Gaya and Sanchi on the one hand
and the later Gupta and Pallava Art on the other.
Accepting freely the principle of art for the sake
of art, the craftsmen of Amravati School created
beautiful human images, of course, images of the
Buddha were built and the great stupa of Amravati
was adorned with limestone reliefs depicting scenes
of the Buddha’s life and surrounded by free standing
figures of Buddha, but figures and statues of males and
females exceed them in number and quality. The same
way, though this school successfully depicted lone,
compassion, devotion and sacrifice yet the physical
beauty and the sensual expression commanded its art.
The figures and statues carved under this school have
been regarded as the best among the contemporaries
not only from the point of view of their size, physical
beauty and expressions of human emotions, but also
from the point of view of composition. The figures
and images are so composed that they seem to be
inter-linked with each other and present before an
onlooker not distinct figures and images but a well
composed painting depicting a scene or an event.
The art of Amravati is frankly naturalistic and sensuous. The female figures in different moods and poses
(standing, sitting, bending, flying, dancing etc.) are its
best creations. The forms of Yakshinis and the dancing
girls have full breasts, heavy lips and living flesh and
they exhibit infi nite love, grace and beauty. Even men,
animals and vegetations have been treated elegantly.
And images and figures of even more than sixteen feet
in height were built here. Here feminine beauty has been
depicted more successfully than compared to Mathura.
Its main centres were Amravati, Nagararjuna Konda
and Jaggayapeta. Its artists mainly used white marble
for the construction of figure and images.
The school of Mathura and Amravati closed that
chapter in the art sculpture which had started at
Bharhut, Gaya and Sanchi. The school of Mathura
accepted a human being as a distinct entity and emphasis was laid on the depiction of physical beauty
through art. The Amravati school forged ahead it.
While the Mathura school failed to exhibit sensuous
desires markedly, the Amravati School succeeded
in that. Thereby, for the first time, Indian Art of
sculpture came closer to the physical and emotional
need of man. By now, Indian Art had reached in a
new stage in which physical, sensual and emotional
elements found expression. Hence, the primary
aim of the art no longer served religion but human
beings. Art is the mirror of any society. The change
of attitude in art was a part of change in attitude of
society in general.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cave Architecture</i></strong></div>  

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ajanta Caves</i></strong></div>  

Concurrent with the emergence of the production
of Hindu structural temples throughout the Gupta
domains, Mahayana Buddhists entered into an extraordinarily active period of cave excavation at a number
of sites, primarily in the Western Ghat mountains of
the Deccan. The initial resurgence of cave monastery
excavations occurred under the Vakatakas.
Under their ambitious and successful King Harisena
(c.460-478), these princelings of Central India became
powerful contenders in the constant struggle for political supremacy. The king was probably not a Buddhist and it is not known whether or not he actively
patronized the creation of monastic establishments, but
his ministers and some of his feudatory princes were
devoted followers (upasakas) who lavishly provided
for the sangha. Harisena, having secured much of the
Western Deccan, established a peaceful set of conditions for a brief but spectacular fl orescence at the site
of Ajanta, where more than twenty caves, many of
them major achievements of architecture, sculpture
and painting in their own right, were excavated during the Vakataka period. Dramatically cut into the
curved mountain wall above the Waghora River, the
caves constitute virtually complete monastic entities,
including living quarters, devotional areas and assembly halls. Although the ephemeral objects used by the
monks in their daily lives are gone, the caves provide
important insights into Buddhist theory, practice and
religious expression in art of the period.
Except for the few caves belonging to an early
phase of activity, all the caves belong to the Vakataka
period. Walter Spink, the leading authority on
Ajanta’s later phase, argues convincingly that other
writers are erroneous in their contention that such
extraordinary achievements must have taken many
decades, if not centuries, to produce; instead, he suggests that a brief intense period of fervent activity
corresponding primarily to the relatively short span
of Harisena’s reign accounted for the production of
all the later caves. In general, the earliest Vakataka
artist activity occurred near the centre of the site
(the pre-Vakataka nucleus) and the latest activity
took place towards the two extremes.
Only two Chaitya halls were excavated during the
Vakataka phase at Ajanta. Since one of them, cave
19, was primarily completed towards the beginning
of the Vakataka resurgence and the other, Cave 26,
towards the end, they may be used to demonstrate
the general artistic direction during this brief span
of time. Cave 19 is fairly securely dated to the first
part of the Vakataka fl orescence on the basis of an
inscription on the veranda of Cave 17 that refers to
gandhakuti (fragrant hall) to the west of it, which
must be Cave 19. The Cave 17 inscription also refers
to Harisena as the ruling prince, clearly indicating that
the excavations were carried out while he was in full
power, in contrast to the inscription in the later apsidal
chaitya hall, Cave 26, which suggests that Harisena’s
position was considerable weakened. The epigraph
further describes the donor’s lavish expenditure on
Cave 17 as “such that little should men (the poor?)
could not even grasp in their imaginations, “ and
indeed, this statement might be used in general to
describe the munifi cent patronage that Ajanta enjoyed
during the latter half of the fifth century.
Cave 19 consists of a courtyard with accompanying cells as well as the chaitya hall itself. Its elaborate
façade contains a single entrance into the cave, marked
by a pillared portico that projects from the wall of rock.
The large circular window above the portico with its
rock-cut rafters reveals the heritage of early chaitya
halls that had been based on wooden proto-types,
Cave 9 at this very site must have served as a model.
However, the decoration around the opening, with its
ornamented crest and the “fl aps” at the side, reveals
that the window is in the form of the fully developed
chandrasala seen frequently on Gupta temples.
Little trace of the earlier Chaitya hall façade is
visible on the rest of the exterior, however, for its
decorated pilasters, cornices and other architectural
features create a kind of grid within which are numerous sculptures, primarily of Buddha figures.
Symmetrically placed attendants fl ank the arched
window. Delicately posed and beautifully dressed,
the figures suggest the highest achievements of fifth
century art. Below, two panels to each side of the
door are created by carved pilasters, the two inner compartments and two outer niches containing
comparable but not identical subjects. Nearest the
entrance the cave on the right, a large representation
of Sakyamuni Buddha offers his rightful inheritance
(that is, the promise of Buddhahood) to the small
figure of his son, Rahul. To the left of the door, a
comparable Buddha makes a similar gesture, again
offering the promise of Buddhahood.
However, in this case, the identity of the scene is
not certain. It may depict the Buddha’s descent from
Trayastrimsa, and thus the promise of Buddhahood
to Utpali, the female nun turned male devotee who
was the first to greet the Buddha upon his descent.
Or, it might represent Dipamkara Buddha, a Buddha of the remote past who predicted to the future
Sakyamuni, then a youth named Sumedha, that he

would attain Buddhahood in a future life.
In either narrative, the underlying message in
the promise of Buddhahood, a poignant message
to the monk worshipper whose life was devoted to
attain the state. In their positions fl anking the door
and facing inward, the figures seem to offer the
same gift the right to Buddhahood to the devotee
entering the cave. A crown held above the head of
each of the two Buddhas indicates their nature as
manifestations of the Universal.
The figures themselves are gracefully posed in
relaxed attitudes of the type seen in Gupta formulations of approximately the same date at other sites. Like
Buddhas at Sarnath and Mathura, they wear clinging,
diaphanous garments revealing the forms of the bodies
beneath. Huskier and fuller bodied than their north
Indian counterparts, however, these figures refl ect a
Western Deccan convention and figure type.
Next to these compositions are reliefs that also
portray comparable although not identical subjects.
The scene to the right of Rahula’s inheritance shows
a similar architectural construction containing another
standing Buddha, but in this case, instead of rounded
from the stupa above, there is a seated Buddha. This
interchangeability or equivalency between the Buddha
and the stupa was seen in Andhra Pradesh at Nagarjuna-konda, where paired chaitya halls contained
respectively a Buddha and a stupa.
The interior of the cave appears lavish compared
to the stark interiors of early Chaitya halls. Thick pillars, closely set and carved with vertical or diagonal
fl utes, crowd the interior, while above sculpted panels
showing Buddha figures rim the hall. Rafters, still
suggestive of the structural prototypes of the rock-cut
halls are carved in the ceiling above. The main objective of veneration, the stupa, differs greatly in form
from those of earlier periods, which where generally
simple domes atop a one-or-two-stepped drum.
Much more vertical in appearance and with an
almost spherical dome, the stupa rests on a base
with offset sides. At the front, a pilastered torana
encloses a sculpted representation of a standing
Buddha, while the remaining surface of the stupa
is carved into units that may have once contained
painted representations.
Above the dome, the harmika contains a depiction
of seated Buddha and above are three chattras that
in turn support a miniature stupa. Around the hall,
the Buddha figures in the frieze and in the centre of
the bracket capitals of the pillars may represent some
of the Buddhas of the various buddhalokas (Buddha
worlds) presumed by Mahayanists to exist throughout
the universe. Orderly in their arrangement, the figures
are part of a highly decorative scheme, elaborately
carved with foliated and architectural motifs. All of
these were originally fully polychromed, as was the
entire interior of the cave.
The decoration of Cave 26 demonstrates the final
burst of exuberance at Ajanta. An inscription identifi es
the donor of the cave as the Bhikshu Buddhabhadra
who dedicated it to the deceased Bhaviraja, a Minister
of the Asmaka feudatories of the Vakatakas.
The reference to the Asmakas in the inscription
and the lack of mention of the Vakatakas suggest
that while these ambitious rivals had perhaps not yet
overthrown the Vakatakas, they were on the brink of
doing so, thus putting the date of the dedication of this
cave very near to the end of Ajanta’s fl orescence.
Much larger and more elaborate than Cave 19, Cave
26 anticipates the Buddhist and Hindu monuments
that were created later in Western India during the
sixth century with their colossal scale and dramatically
ambitious schemes. Sprink has shown that the cave
itself was only part of a much grander conception, for
it served as the focal point of a scheme that included
two upper wings and two lower wings.
The façade of Cave 26 has suffered considerable
damage, but it is still possible to reconstruct something of its original appearance. Instead of a portico
like that at Cave 19, a series of steps leads upto a
low plinth and what would have been a covered veranda (now largely destroyed) serving as a transition
between the courtyard preceding the cave and the
chaitya hall itself. A chandrasala window and rows of
carved figures decorate the façade and are similar to
those elements of Cave 19. The interiors of the two
caves also reveal major differences. Scale alone creates
a vastly granduer impression on the visitor to Cave
26, while the treatment of the pillars, carved frieze,
and beamed ceiling are highly reminiscent of similar
features in Cave 19; the grander scale permitted even
greater richness. Carved representations of Buddhas
and bodhisattvas and architectural features decorate
the stupa, in contrast to the plain (but perhaps once
painted) surfaces of the stupa in Cava 19.
The Buddha on the front of the stupa sits in pralambapadasana, the so-called “European pose” characterized by the pendant legs. This pose seems to be
associated with the figures carved towards the end
of the Vakataka phase at Ajanta, although the reasons
behind the introduction of this form remain unclear. It
is possible that such figures are depictions of Maitreya,
the future Buddha, who is characteristically shown in
this pose when serving as a major icon.
An examination of the frieze above the pillars
confirms the greater elaboration and detail of this
cave as compared to that of Cave 19. A relative
reduction in the scale of the Buddha figures and

their niches allowed for greater multiplicity of the
figures as well as increased ornamentation of the
surrounding elements.
The walls of the ambulatory passage around
the perimeter of the cave are also resplendent with
numerous carvings, many of which probably constitute votive offerings by individual donors. The most
impressive sculpture in the pradaksinapatha is a
reclining figure showing the Buddha’s great decease
(parinirvana) extending for seven meters along the
left sidewall. This colossus, surrounded by mourners,
has a profound effect on the visitor to the cave and
anticipates the increasingly grand scale that dominates
cave architecture of subsequent centuries.
Another impressive scene from the life of the
Buddha in the ambulatory passage is a depiction of
the Maravijaya. In contrast to the more simple compositions seen at Cave 19, this scene is fi lled with
numerous subsidiary details. Mara’s hosts surround
the central Buddha figure, who is, curiously, depicted
with his right hand in varadamudra, not the expected
bhumisparsa. Undoubtedly more costly than Cave 19,
Cave 26 with its ubiquitous carving and plentitude
of detail is indicative of the final phase at Ajanta,
which was brought to a close due to the declining
fortunes of the Vakatakas and clearly not a diminution of vigor in the art.
Like the chaitya hall, the vihara was transformed
during the Vakataka phase at Ajanta. In contrast to
early Buddhist viharas, the later examples display
a wealth of sculptural and iconic forms. The most
notable addition to the vihara concept is the creation
of shrine areas at the rear of the viharas that contain
impressive images of Buddha figures.
The incorporation of the Buddha shrine into the
vihara format transforms the excavation from a mere
dwelling place for monks into a metaphor for a
Buddhist paradise in which a Buddha preaches the
dharma to the resident bodhisattvas who are in the
process of attaining perfection and are awaiting their
final rebirths. In Mahayana Buddhism monks take
the vow of a bodhisattva (relinquishing their own
attainment of Buddhahood until all sentient beings
are saved) and progress through the various stages
of bodhisattvas (which they have become through
the process of taking the vows), reside listening to
the teachings of the Buddha.
This interpretation is supported by certain passages
in the veranda inscription of Cave 16, a vihara, which
states that Varahadeva, the minister of Harisena, realizing that life, youth, wealth and happiness are transitory. For the sake of his father and mother, caused to
be made this excellent dwelling to be occupied by the
best of ascetics (the dwelling) which is adorned with
windows, doors, beautiful picture-galleries, ledges,
statues of the nymphs of Indra and the like, which is
ornamented with beautiful pillars and stairs, and has
a temple of the Buddha inside, [Resembles] the places
of the lord of gods [Indra] and is similar to a cave in
the lovely Mandara mountain. The comparison of the
vihara to a palace, especially that of Indra, which is
located signifi cant, for the paradisiacal metaphor of
the viharas is carried out in their decoration, especially
in painted ceilings.Even within the brief period of the
Vakataka fl orescence at Ajanta, the vihara underwent
a number of modifi cations.
Cave 17, approximately contemporary with Cave
19 on the basis of the Cave 17 inscription and the
internal evidence of style, is a standard Mahayana
vihara, having a pillared veranda as a transition
between the exterior and the interior and a squared
central space surrounded by cells. The slight irregularity of the disposition of the monk’s cells seems to
refl ect the cave’s chronological position at the start
of Ajanta’s Vakataka phase, as does the fact that the
enshrined Buddha is completely detached from the
walls so that it could be circumambulated.
While essentially similar to Cave 17, the plan of
the later Cave 2 demonstrates the modifi cations that
took place during this brief but active period. Here,
the arrangement of the walls has become standardized and the Buddha in the main shrine is now set
against the rear wall of that chamber, precluding
circumambulation. Growing complexity, perhaps
associated with the religious functions, is also seen
in the multiplication of cells at the front of the cave
where double-chambered shrine areas are created in
place of the single cells as in the Cave 17.
The culmination of these developments is visible
in the plan of the upper storey of Cave 6, which has
the essential features of Cave 2, note the increasing
ritualism in religion had led to the creation of shrine
areas, complete with antechamber and interior cell,
in the of the side walls. Other cells have also been
converted into shrines, such as at the right front and
right rear of the hall where sculpted Buddha groups
have been added to the cells although there is no
doubling up of cells.
The increased complexity of the religious message
is also visible in the main shrine of this cave where,
in addition to the central Buddha image and his
bodhisattvas and other attendants, representations of
the six manusi Buddhas who preceded Sakyamuni in
his final incarnation are now placed along the side
walls of the interior of the shrine so that the devotee
is virtually surrounded by large Buddha figures.
An interior view of Cave 2 shows the general

appearance of a Mahayana vihara at Ajanta. Lavishly carved pillars and doorways decorate the interior and carry out the iconographic message. All
architectural features, including walls, ceilings and
pillars were fully painted.
The shrine doorway, carved with panels containing
mithuna couples, ressembles in format those found
on contemporary Hindu temples, even to the presence of river goddesses at the top of each jamb. The
enshrined Buddha sits in vajraparyankasana and displays. The specifi c form of the mudra has the thumb
and forefi nger of the right hand forming a circle that
joins the little fi nger of the left hand. By analogy with
mudras of a slightly later date, it may be suggested
that the little fi nger on the left hand pointing to the
circle formed in the right indicates the fourth, or most
esoteric, level of the teachings.
Like other Buddhas from Ajanta’s late phase,
the figure suggests ties to Gupta modes at Sarnath,
Mathura and other sites, but has the very full,
rounded body proportions typical of the Central
Indian and Western Deccan modes.
An interesting feature of Cave 2 is the presence
of sculpture groups in the shrines fl anking the main
Buddha shrine along the rear wall of the cave. The
shrine at the right rear of the cave bears large sculpted
images of Pancika and Hariti, while that to the left
contains figures of two male yakshas. These small
shrines demonstrate the complete integration of the
architectural, sculptural and painted realms at Ajanta,
for not only were the carved images fully polychromed
with the same paint used in the murals on the side
walls, but the murals themselves depict subjects that
complement the sculptured forms. In this case, the
painted figures on the sidewalls seem to approach
the central carved figures. This somewhat illusionist
use of the painted walls creates a dramatic effect on
the human visitor to the shrine, who feels himself an
active participant in the drama being portrayed by
the painted and sculpted forms. Nowhere is it more
clear that paint served a vital role in completing the
iconographic programs and decorative schemes of
South Asian monuments, in spite of the fact that it
has rarely been preserved.
Because of the preservation of its paintings, Ajanta
is a virtually unique document in the history of
pre-Muslim Indic art. Enough painting remains in
many of the caves to indicate that the iconographic
program of the paintings was systematic and an
integral part of the overall scheme of the cave and
not simply decorative.
A number of styles of painting may be discerned in
the caves, demonstrating that a variety of techniques
and methods were employed by the artists. Rather
than indicating that the painting was done at different periods, however, the variety of styles suggests
individual hands of artists.
In general, signifi cant differences exist between
ceiling paintings and wall paintings in format, coloration and even technique. The central spaces of
the vihara ceilings that have survived are painted in
grid-like patterns containing fl oral and abstract motifs
as well as some animal and human scenes. The stylized format is probably a reference to the paradisiacal
realms, laid out in garden-like divisions.
White is abundantly used in the ceilings, although
not on the walls, and this may have been to help
refl ect light in the dim interiors. In contrast to the
predominance of earth tones used in the wall paintings, the ceilings are more brightly coloured. The
animal and plant forms depicted on the ceilings are
frequently painted in a fl at manner, with little modeling or shading, and the forms thus appear almost
as silhouettes against the background. Directly above
important images, in antechambers, and at certain
other specifi ed locations round mandalic patterns with
concentric bands of foliated and fl oriated patterns are
found. An especially fi ne example from Cave 2 bears
pairs of vidyadharas at the four corners.
The programs of wall paintings include, in various
caves, scenes of Buddhas, attendants and jataka tales.
In general Buddhas are represented in or near the
ante-chamber to the shrines, while Jatakas occur in
the main hall. A scene showing Buddhas with groups
of devotees located in the antechamber to the shrine
in Cave 17 suggests a strict hierarchic arrangement
created by the use of three registers like divisions.
<br>
<b>The Buddhas may be identifi ed as forms of
Maitreya:</b> in the top register, he is shown preaching
in his heavenly paradise, Tusita, in the centre, he is
depicted descending from Tusita and welcoming his de
votees into his earthly paradise, Ketumati; below, he
is seen preaching in Ketumati. As in other ante-chamber paintings, this composition appears more formal
than those of the more free-fl owing Jataka scenes of
the main cave area, a feature that may relate to their
greater iconic rather than narrative function.
Light coloured figures are silhouetted against
the dark background and a separation between the
Buddha’s space and that of the attendant figures is
maintained. An interesting feature visible here and in
numerous other painting at Ajanta is the treatment of
landscape, especially mountain forms, in crystalline,
cubical shapes similar to those seen approximately
contemporaneously in sculpture. These, however, seem
to project into the viewer’s space rather than recede
behind the picture plane, creating a dynamic relationship between the viewer and the painted world.
In contrast to the more formal arrangement of the

ceilings and antechambers, the walls of the main halls
are alive with very free fl owing compositions and
figures arranged in asymmetrical, crowded groupings.
Earth tones, many of which were derived from local
minerals found in the region around Ajanta, harmonize
the forms and provide the main totality.
Several means of creating form seem to have been
available to the Ajanta artist. For example, the body
of the bodhisattva to the right of the entrance to the
antechamber to the main shrine in Cave I, is created
primarily by the use of modulation of colours rather
than through use of line. Highlighting of certain areas,
such as the nose or brow, helps to bring forth the
form of the dim interior although light and shadow
are not used in what might be called a scientifi c
manner or to elucidate three-dimensionality. That is,
shading and highlighting were used at will by the
artists to enhance their creations without regard for
light as a phenomenon of the physical world, subject
to certain empirical laws.
Even the forms of the bodhisattva’s body are beyond
the rules of the material world, and indeed, by freeing
the figures from such regulation, the artists seem to
capture the essence of the Buddhist religion, with its
skepticism toward phenomenal existence. While clearly
human in inspiration, the part of the bodhisattva’s body
are likened to other objects; his brow, for example,
takes the shape of the archer’s bow, his eyes are like
lotus petals, and his torso is shaped like that of a lion.
Such metaphors appear in textual descriptions and
were often quite literally translated into visual terms.
Similar metaphors are sometimes used in the creation
of parts of the body of Buddha figures.
Numerous Jataka tales are represented on the
walls of the Ajanta caves. Some, which must have
been important in the specifi c sectarian beliefs of the
monks in residence, are repeated a number of times
in the various caves and many of them treat human
rather than animal incarnations of Shakyamuni Buddha. Often, several episodes from specifi c stories are
shown, although these are generally not arranged in
sequence on the walls.
A detail from the Mahajanaka Jataka depicted in
Cave I shows Prince Mahajanka surrounded by a bevy
of beautiful women, crowned and bejewelled and thus
representing the epitome of princely life and possibly
refl ecting contemporary patterns of dress and life
during Gupta and Vakataka times. However, the Buddhist message of the story is clear, since Mahajanaka
relinquishes his princely life in favour of the life of a
recluse. With his hands in gesture of discourse similar
to Dharma-chakara mudra, he is depicted announcing
his intention to give up his kingdom.
The facial features of the figures, with the highly
arched brows and elongated lotiform eyes, resemble
the treatment of the bodhisattva at the rear of the cave
and may refl ect an ideal based on contemporaneous
concepts of beauty. The forms of the body are outlined with a darker chroma of the same hue as the
body itself. The animated positions and stances of the
figures lend liveliness to the composition, typical of
the Jataka representations at Ajanta in general.
Often, scenes at Ajanta take on an almost secular
character, although all may be justifi ed as being part
of a Jataka or other Buddhist context.
A woman on a swing in Cave 2 belongs to a
depiction of the Vidhurapandita Jataka and may be
identifi ed as Irandati, the Naga princess central to the
story. Here, the highlighting technique used freely
at Ajanta creates the impression of a glow over the
surface of her skin. The narrow waists, full breast and
hips of the women in the composition display the
same feminine ideal that is found throughout most
periods and styles of Indic art. As is true throughout most of the Ajanta paintings, the three quarter
facial view is preferred in this composition, creating
a suggestion of depth and volume for the forms.
The brownish red back ground strewn with fl owers
serves as a conventionalized landscape in this and
other scenes, but as in most of South Asian art, the
artist depends on the figures to tell the story, to create
a sense of life, and to carry the mood; architectural
and landscape elements are employed only to add
a setting or structure to the scene, not to create an
ambience or to stimulate the physical world.
In addition to walls and ceilings, virtually every
portion of the caves was painted, including doorframes and pillars. Flat surface without carving were
often completed in paint, which, when lost, leads us
to forget that these portions were important parts of
the decorative scheme.
A Pillar from Cave 17 shows a pair of music making dwarves inhabiting the square base. Different in
treatment from the figures already discussed, these
dwarves are created by the use of a prominent black
outline that defi nes the contours and details of their
forms. Such line drawings are found throughout the
Ajanta paintings, sometimes appearing in compositions that make use of the shading and highlighting
techniques and thus it seems that such a method was
simply one of the techniques available to artists to
use as they chose. The skill of the Ajanta artist as
draftsmen is evident in compositions such as this.
As vital documents of Buddhist art, the Ajanta
caves can hardly be overestimated. In a short burst
of incredible artistic activity, the patrons, together
with the sculptors, painters and iconographers, provided a concise illustration of the general tendency

in Indic art towards embellishment and elaboration
of the highest quality.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bagh Caves</i></strong></div>  

A closely related and contemporaneous group of
cave at Bagh provides further evidence of Mahayana
cave architecture. Although some distance away in the
Narmada Valley, architectural, sculptural, and painting affi nities, with the caves at Ajanta are probably
much more than purely coincidental since, according
to the Dasaku-maracharita (the ten princes) written
by Dandin in the seventh century, the Vakataka King
Harisena had a son who ruled over the Bagh region.
Spink claims that this son must have ruled prior to
480 A.D., for by that time, one Maharaja Subandhu,
who is known from a copper plate inscription found
at Bagh, was ruling the region and the Vakataka line
had collapsed. Spink estimates period of fl orescence
at Bagh to have occurred between 470 & 480 A.D.
Much ruined due to water seepage and rock falls
affecting the soft, friable sandstone, the caves preserve
little of their former beauty. In plan, Cave 2 greatly
resembles Mahayana viharas at Ajanta, although four
central pillars are present, undoubtedly included for
structural purposes due to the weakness of the rock.
The central pillars, much more massive appearing
than pillars at Ajanta, are treated differently from
others in the cave, having a spiraled fl uting and being round rather than being square or consisting of
square and round sections.
The specious antechamber to the shrine bears
sculptures of Buddhas and bodhisattvas on the side
and rear walls. In style, these figures are part of the
broadly defi ned Gupta mode, but differ from their
Ajanta counterparts in their more slender bodies and
more attenuated appearance. Instead, they seem more
closely allied to northern and north-central Indian
styles of the Gupta period. This is not surprising
considering Bagh’s location nearer to the epicentre
of the Gupta art traditions.
A very important characteristic of this and other
caves at Bagh is the presence of a stupa rather than
a Buddha image as the main object of veneration
in the shrine. This feature has led some scholars to
conclude that the Bagh excavations predated those at
Ajanta and that they represent a state of transition
between the use of a stupa and that of a Buddha
image as an object of veneration.
However, it is clear from images such as that in
the shrine of Cave II at Ajanta, where a representation
of the Buddha is part of a stupa, that the symbols are
identical and interchangeable and do not necessarily
have chronological implications, at least by this date,
when both Buddhas and stupa’s abundantly survive
as part of the standard, artistic vocabulary.
The paintings at Bagh, known today only in fragments and from copies, bear a great deal of resemblance to their contemporary counterparts at Ajanta.
Indeed, Subandhu’s inscription found in the debris
of Cave 2 calls the monastery Kalayana (Abode of
Art), suggesting something of the original splendour
of the site.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kanheri Caves</i></strong></div>  

During the late fifth and sixth centuries, artistic
activity at Kanheri was resumed. A number of old
caves were modifi ed and many new excavations
were begun, bringing the total number of caves at
the site to over one hundred and making Kanheri
the most extensive caves site in India. It is likely
that the resurgence of artistic activity was initiated
due to patronage by the Traikutakas, who came
into control of the region upon the collapse of their
former overlords, the Vakatakas, as a copper plate
inscription found in front of Cave 3 and datable to
around 494 A.D. suggests.
A pair of colossal Buddhas, one at either end of
the verandah of this great second century chaitya
hall, was part of the refurbishing of that cave during
the late fifth century, a date suggested by the style
of the images as well as the paleography of an associated inscription referring to one such dedication.
More than seven meters in height, each figure stands
in an arch with vidyadharas bearing garlands above,
and each displays veranda mudra, the gesture of gift
bestowal or offering, which may be interpreted as an
invitation to enlightenment.
Stylistically, the figures refl ect the massive, full
form of Ajanta representations and it is possible that
artists who had worked at Ajanta, or their descendants
had moved to Kanheri to begin work there.
While architecturally many of the new caves
excavated during this phase at Kanheri are rather
plain, a number of extremely important images were
produced, serving as vital documents of developments
in the Buddhist religion. Cave 90, a monument of
perhaps the early to middle sixth century is a simple,
single, chamber abundantly carved with sculptures
and could have been donated for merit rather than
as a hall for initiations or rituals.
The original shrine images are lost, but on the side
walls two important sculptures show in graphic form
arrangements that had been developing for a long
time. On the viewer’s left wall is a Buddha scene,
while on the right wall is a depiction of Avalokitesvara as protector of the faithful. As an iconographic
statement, each marks a signifi cant departure from
earlier examples.
Properly speaking the composition of the Buddha
scene is a specifi c schematization through which the
religious practitioner achieves both understanding

and reintegration with the Universal. In this case, the
central figure demonstrates the dharmakaya aspect of
Buddhahood, the Universal, and is perhaps properly
called Sarvavid (universal knowledge) Vairocana. This
identifi cation does not negate the interpretation of this
figure as the historical Buddha Sakayamuni as well,
since the two are identical in the ultimate sense.
In the four corners of the composition, four smaller
images identical to that in the centre represent the four
Jinas who, together with the central Buddha, comprise
of the fi ve Jina mandala (panchajina). These Buddhas
are the personifi cations of the essence of the Universal
(jnana) who emerge from the four quarters (that is, all
directions) to impart knowledge to the initiate.
They represent the so-called sambhogakaya (or
bliss body), which together with the nirmanakaya
and the dharmakaya comprise the three kayas of the
Buddhist trikaya system. As imparters of knowledge,
they represent the teaching modality of Buddhism.
These Buddhas, in later art differentiated by specifi c
mudras and vahanas, are Aksobhya (east), Ratnasambhava (south), Amitabha (west), and Amoghasiddhi
(north), each shown here in dharmachakra mudra
and pralambapadasana.
Along each vertical side of the composition is a
row of four Buddhas, together representing the eight
manusi Buddhas, the nirmanakaya, who are charged
with the responsibility of teaching the Buddhist religion to the beings of the mundane world.
Beneath the central figure, attending the stalk
upon which his lotus pedestal reset, are depictions of
Indra and Brahma with female consorts, and nagas
and nagins below, both groups shown as essentially
subordinates of the main figure. Flanking the Buddha
is a pair of bodhisattvas, each also having a female
companion. By the sixth century, female images had
emerged as an important part of Buddhist Mahayana
iconographic conceptions, at Kanheri as well as at
numerous other sites in South Asia. In Buddhist
theory, the female personifi es the concept of prajna,
or transcendental knowledge, while the male denotes
upaya, the practice necessary to lead the practitioner
to the attainment of that knowledge. The combination
of two is the Buddhist enlightenment, symbolized
in later Buddhism by yuganaddha (sexually joined)
couples. Thus, the concept of mithuna, which had
long been a motif in Buddhist art, is integrated into
an expression of one of the most essential and fundamental beliefs in the religion.
The icon of Avalokitesvara as protector of the faithful is of a type that occurs widely in the western caves
in a similar format. However, this version is unique
in that it depicts Avalokitesvara as protector against
ten perils (rather than the usual eight) and includes
numerous subsidiary figures. Above the head of the
central figure is the primo generic source of the entire
icon, the dharmakaya, in this case Vairocana, attended
by two bodhisattvas. Avalokitesvara is fl anked by his
two female consorts, Tara (to his right) and Bhrkuti
(to his left). Tara, whose name means “star,” and
the North Star implicitly, represents the fi xed point
of universality towards which the devote progress,
while Bhrkuti name, ‘abundantly full hall,’ refers to
the achievement of the fully enlightened mind.
In this litany, Avalokitesvara offers the devotee
promise of salvation from the various perils depicted
on the sides of the composition, including attack by
elephants, lions, robbers and similar disasters. While
the lay worshiper might accept these perils in a literal
sense and invoke Avalokitesvara for protection against
the specifi c threat, an advanced practitioner would
understand these on a metaphorical level, each danger representing a potential hindrance on his path to
Buddhahood. The wild elephant, for example, would
be seen as the wild mind in need of taming, that is,
the mental discipline necessary to achieve the Buddhist goal. Such litany scenes served as proto-types
for examples found in Inner Asia, China, Japan, and
the Himalayan regions.
A representation of a highly unusual form of
Avalokitesvara attending a seated Buddha in Cave
41 indicates advanced and esoteric Buddhist practices
at Kanheri.
Dating from approximately the late fifth or early
sixth century, the images show the bodhisattvas in
an eleven headed (ekadasamukha) form which while
found frequently in later Buddhist art outside of
South Asia as in Nepal, Tibet, China and Japan, is
not known in the Indic realm except at a rather late
date in Kashmir and the eastern regions. This image is
thus the only artistic documentation for the view that
this iconographic type originates in India. It may be
inferred from art as well as literature that the eleven
heads, consisting of ten bodhisattva heads topped by
a Buddha head, represent the dasabhumikas, or the
ten stages of achievement of the bodhisattva along
with the final attainment of Buddhahood.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Aurangabad Caves</i></strong></div>  

Not far from Ajanta, at Aurangabad, a number
of Buddhist caves were carved during different periods, while two of these caves (1 and3) belong to the
Vakataka period and were excavated contem-poraneously with the late Mahayana phase at Ajanta, others
were created in the latter half of the sixth century and
thus represent a stylistic and iconographic advancement from the earlier monuments. Spink suggests
that these caves (6,7 and 9) were carved when the

region had come under the control of the Kalachuris,
who, he believes, were also responsible for the major
Hindu excavations at Jogesvari, Manda¬-pesvara and
Elephanta. Cave 7, dating from around 560, seems
to combine the ritual need for circumambulation
seen in the early Vakataka phase at Ajanta with the
preference for placing the shrine Buddha against the
rear wall of the chamber by creating an ambulatory
passage around the entire shrine.
The sidewalls of the passage-way open into a series
of cells while the rear wall contains two subsidiary
shrines. The ground plan suggests that the principal
shrine had simply been moved forward into the main
hall of a typical Mahayana vihara, although this may
not in fact be the way in which this form evolved.
The shrines at the rear of the prakadsinapatha, as
well as the primary shrine, each contain a sculpture
of a Buddha seated in pralamabapadasana and displaying dharmachakara mudra.
The caves of the post-Vakataka phase carry out the
iconographic program and larger monumental figures.
The front wall leading into the circumambulatory passage from the veranda, for example, bears a sizable
panel of a litany of Avalokitesvara to the left of the
central door of another bodhisattva to the right.
These figures demonstrate a stylistic departure
from the earlier Vakataka style, having a new tautness to the contours of their bodies, fuller shoulders
and swelling hips.
They are best compared to figures such as the
dvarapalas from Mandasor, the sculptures at Elephanta or others of the sixth century. The hair style
of Avalokitesvara, with its tendril like curls and high
piled up appearance, is characteristic of sixth century
conventions, further showing departure from Gupta
and Vakataka trends, in addition, the treatment of the
lintel of the doorway with its multitude of miniature
shrines anticipates the architectural elaboration seen
in several later North Indian regional styles.
 Similar stylistic developments may also be seen
in the treatment of female figures, as in the important
panel of the left of the door to the central shrine or
the figure group inside the shrine, along the left wall.
The voluptuous figures are full breasted, round hipped
and have swelling thighs. In the group inside the
shrine, the figures seem life-like, a feeling enhanced
by the suggested movement and animation of their
poses, which marks a departure from the quietude
of figures in the Gupta and Vakataka periods and
anticipates the active, dynamic figures of subsequent
centuries. The elaborate coiffures are again characteristics of the sixth century.
It may be noted that the vidyadharas are set against
clouds that are indicated by a scalloped form that
is seen widely throughout the Deccan in the sixth
century and is especially a characteristic of Early
Western Chalukya sculptures. In some respects, the
female figures are also very close to those seen in
Early Western Chalukya Art.
The presence of prominent female imagery, especially females as attendants to bodhisattvas or Buddhas, demonstrates the growing importance of sexual
symbolism in Buddhism, associated with Tantric or
Vajaryanic sects. The group to the left of the central
shrine door shows Tara, the principal consort of
Avalokitesvara, accompanied by two female refl ections or aspects of her who are in turn accompanied
by dwarves.
The dwarf at the left is very similar to the Saivite
dwarves attending the Maheshvara image at Elephanta
reinforcing the suggestions of the approximate contemporaneousness of two monuments. This figure,
the only male in the entire composition, has a hair
arrangement consisting of fi ve topknots that represent
the fi ve bijas (sound essences) of the panachajina
mandala (the mandala of the fi ve Buddhas). In both
his maleness and his ascetic quality, he represents
upaya, the action necessary to attain Buddhahood,
and the other dwarf, a female to Tara’s left, personifi es prajna (wisdom), which is part of jnana, the
knowledge needed for Buddhahood.
The image thus reiterates the basic Mahayana
concept, but it is one step further removed, since
the practitioner must unite Tara with Avalokitesvara
to achieve karuna, and only then can he integrate
Avalokitesvara with Vajrapani to reach bodhi. In
another sense, the central figure of Tara is not different from a Buddha, with garland bearing vidyadharas above and personifi cations of knowledge and
compassion at her side.
The spectacular female group consisting of a dancing woman accompanied by six female musicians on
the left wall of the main shrine is dramatic evidence
for female and sexual symbolism in Buddhism. The
shrine is based on the type that was developed in the
last phase at Ajanta with the central Buddha figure
accompanied by sculpted depictions of the six manusi
Buddhas, but goes beyond the earlier formulation with
the addition of this important panel and the figures
on the opposite wall consisting of a Bodhisattva, his
female companion and a dwarf. In one accepts the
musicians in the group on the left wall at face value,
as accompanists to the dancer, the main figure that
needs interpretation is the dancer herself.
Bharatnatyam, the classical form of Indian dance
was in advanced stages of development by the sixth

century and already included an extensive vocabulary
of gestures, each with a relatively explicitly meaning to be interpreted by the audience. According to
Bharatnatyam literature, the gesture made by the
left hand of the Aurangabad dancer is ardha pataka,
‘half fl ag,’ with the palm upwards, a sign that has a
dual meaning: at one level, it represents two, both,
or any sort of duality, but on another, it symbolizes
a long or tall, slender object that would be known
from the context of the story line being portrayed
in the dance. Since the gesture is directed towards
the genital area, it may be intended to suggest the
male member and perhaps the sexual act itself. In
light of this and other evidence at the site, it is clear
that tantric forms of Buddhism were in practice at
Aurangabad in the sixth century.
Sexual imagery, which eventually culminates in
the representation of figures in inter course (yuganaddha) was long misunderstood by scholars as a
degeneration of Buddhist ideals. However, the total
emotional and physical involvement of the individual
with the partner during sexual activity is a metaphor
in Indic religious thought for the mystical union with
the Universal; the combining of the male and female
into a totally integrated unity was seen to symbolize
the active path to enlightenment.
In practice, sexual activities did become part of
the religious rituals of certain Buddhist and Hindu
sects, but these were kept secret and were restricted
to esoteric practices since it was feared that imitations
would lack understanding and might misinterpret
the activities as simple orgiastic pleasure seeking.
Indeed, it was recognized that one of the pitfalls of
the path of yuganaddha was to sink into a lustful
quest for pleasure.
It is appropriate that the female figure is dancing, since, in Indic thought, dancing is one of the
arts necessary for the accomplished sexual partner
and constitutes one aspect of sexual foreplay. The
full-fl edged forms of the females suggest their desirability, the intensity of desire being likened to
the fervor with which the religious goal should be
pursued. In texts, the female partners are described
as being sixteen years of age and in the full bloom
of youth. It is evident that the artists attempted to
convey such a notion in their sculpture.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ellora Caves</i></strong></div>  

The final phase of development of Buddhist caves
in Western India is seen at Ellora, a site near Ajanta
and Aurangabad that had already become an important Hindu centre in the last half of the sixth century.
Although the specifi c patronage of the Buddhist
caves is not known, they were probably excavated
during the seventh century, when the Early Western
Chalukyas had achieved supremacy in the Deccan,
though not necessarily in this region.
A number of the Buddhist caves at Ellora seem
to recapitulate some of the basic architectural and
iconographic formats found at other sites, but others
suggest innovative and advanced Buddhist thinking.
Cave 5, the earliest Buddhist cave at Ellora, is a large
rectangular hall, about thirty-fi ve meters in length,
with surrounding small cells, a shrine in the centre
of the rear wall, and two other shrine areas in the
centres of the side walls.
The expansion of the two side shrine areas may
be seen as further development of the plan of Cave
6 (upper) at Ajanta, although here the main hall has
become elongated. Both the rectangular, axial format
and the addition of cross-axis shrines are features that
developed in Hindu monuments of the preceding
century, such as the Shiva cave at Elephanta. The
treatment of the pillars with their cushion capitals
further suggests such a connection.
A key feature in this cave (found also in a similar cave at Kanheri, but preserved nowhere else in
South Asia) is the double row of stone benches
extending almost the full length of the hall, within
the rectangle of pillars. Such benches are typical of
the seating pattern used in ritual recitation in later
Tantrism and Zen Buddhism outside of India and
suggest that benches made of ephemeral materials
might possibly have been used in vihara and chaitya
type caves or free standing buildings for centuries,
but that their memory is preserved only in the rockcut examples at Ellora and Kanheri.
The vast scale and ambitiousness of the later Buddhist caves is seen in Cave 12, the so-called Tin Thal,
a three storey excavation, each fl oor of which is larger
than any single cave at Ajanta. Its plain and austere
façade belies the richness of sculptural decoration
within. This cave complex, one of the last Buddhist
excavations to be carried out at Ellora, may have been
created in the late seventh or even the early eighth
century. It is entered through a rock-cut gateway that
leads to a spacious courtyard preceding the cave.
Each fl oor of the cave is different in plan and format. The first fl oor consists of a rectangular pillared
hall entered on the long side with a large pillared
antechamber and shrine extending on axis with the
entrance to the rear. Small cells are placed at the sides
and rear of the main hall. While the second storey is
essentially similar in concept (although not in details
such as the number of pillars or cells), the cross-axis
leading from the front centre of the cave to the shrine
at the rear is emphasized by the treatment of pillars
and the addition of an extension of that axis towards
the façade side of the cave. A veranda has also been

included along the front of the cave to provide access from the staircase at the front left to the centre
of the cave for proper entrance. The top fl oor has
pillars arranged in a transverse manner, lacks subsidiary cells, and has a relatively small antechamber
preceding the shrine.
The main shrine on each fl oor contains the now
familiar set of images, a Buddha attended by two bodhisattvas (Avalokitesvara on his right and Vajrapani
or Manjuvajra, a form of Manjusri, a bodhisattva who
personifi es wisdom, who carries a vajra on a lotus,
on his left). But in addition, the eight bodhisattvas
often grouped together in a confi guration known
as the eight-bodhisattva mandala (astabodhisattva
mandala) also appear in the shrines, four on each
side on the central Buddha.
Each bodhisattva is clearly identifi ed by the attribute held in his left hand. Other representations
of the eight bodhisattvas, identical in meaning, but
taking on a much more mandalic appearance, are
found in other locations in the cave. In these, the
eight bodhisattvas surround a central Buddha in a
nine square diagram.
The presence of three storeys or levels is one of
the most signifi cant features of this cave. While earlier
excavations in the Western Deccan might have had
multiple storeys, these were not necessarily harmonized
into a single scheme. Cave 6, at Ajanta, for example,
consists of two separate excavations that are different
in date and may have had little inherent unity.
In Ellora Cave 12 and its neighbour Cave 11 are
the result of single, unifi ed, pre-planned arrangements, possibly related to Buddhist practices in
which three stages might be identifi ed: an initiation
or introductory phase, as more advanced practice,
and finally, the stage for the true acharyas, or highly
developed spiritual masters. Such use of levels in
architecture is found in Nepali Buddhism, and it is
probable that the Nepali practice was based on an
Indic precedent such as this.
The full range of the iconographic program that
is richly carved on all three levels of the cave can
only be sampled in a brief survey such as this; the
complexity and richness is an indication of the late
phase of Mahayana cave architecture and developments that had been occurring in the Buddhist religion.
For example, the upper story of Cave 12 has large
images of Buddhas along the side walls representing the Buddhas of the ten directions (four cardinal
directions, zenith, nadir and the four intermediate
points) a standard reference in Buddhist literature
to the universality of Buddhahood- who comes to
an initiate during abhisheka (“head sprinkling,” or
initiation) to confer jnana on him.
One example shows a typical figure, deeply
carved so that it is almost in the round, surrounded
by a tableau of figures, including bodhisattvas and
vidyadharas. Increasingly, after the painted caves at
Ajanta, sculpture was used to create a greater effect
on the devotee who was literally surrounded by
human size and much larger religious images as he
moved through such caves.
To either side of the entrance to the shrine antechamber are representations of the manusi Buddhas.
In contrast to the earlier Vakataka depictions, these
figures have a stiff, dry, inanimate quality characteristic of much of the later Mahayana sculpture at
Ellora, thus representing the crystallization of form
that characterizes many post-Gupta artistic idioms,
and indicating that perhaps something had been
sacrificed in the fervor to achieve gigantic scale.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Temple Architecture</i></strong></div>  

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Stone Temples</i></strong></div>  

As part of the growing popularity of Hinduism,
temples dedicated to various Hindu deities were constructed throughout northern and north-central India
during the Gupta period. Usually, these structures
are classifi ed according to certain physical characteristics as well as their relationship to later forms.
Regional patterns may have accounted for some of
the differences between temple types, but, in addition, ritual needs of growing Hindu religion, as well
as sectarian differences, necessitated the development
of individual types.
Some of the forms refl ect structures that must have
existed prior to the fifth century but which have been
lost, and others may have been completely innovative.
A few selected examples suggest the richness of the
developing forms.
One such example is the Vishnu temple at Deogarh
commonly (and mistakenly) called the Dasavatara because it was originally thought that the iconographic
program referred to the ten incarnations (dasavatara)
of Vishnu. Although the patrons and donors involved
in its erection are not known, on stylistic grounds, the
structure may be dated to the early sixth century. In
many ways, the form of the temple shows considerable
advancement in the development of Hindu temple
architecture, a factor that has led some to conclude
that its date is much later.
The form of the tower is one of the most interesting and highly debated features in this regard, since
it’s tall apparently curvilinear shape anticipates the
developed northern style sikhara. Its damaged state,
however, precludes full analysis, and thus the place
of this temple in the development of the northern
style sikhara may never be known.

The main shrine occupies the centre of a square
plinth that is accessible on all four sides by staircases
with semicircular base sometimes referred to as moonstones. Originally, four smaller subsidiary shrines were
present, one at each corner of the plinth, so that the
temple is of the panchayatana (fi ve-shrine) variety.
Each shrine was probably dedicated to a different
Hindu deity, although their identities are unknown
because the structures are totally destroyed except for
their bases. Further, it is impossible to determine the
original forms of the buildings, although they may
have been miniature versions of the main temple.
The temple is oriented to the west, where the
impressive, decorated doorway to the shrine is located. In contrast to the early Gupta-type entrance
seen at Udayagiri, the Deogarh doorway is a greatly
elaborated ensemble. The lintels and jambs have been
multiplied, and these are replete with well-ordered foliate motifs, mithunas, guardian figures, and the river
goddesses, Ganga and Yamuna placed respectively
at the top left and right of the doorway and clearly
defi ned by their makara and tortoise vehicles.
At the centre, above the entranceway, is a panel
showing Vishnu in an unusual form, seated atop the
coiled body of a serpent with the open serpent hood
behind his head while Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu
massages his foot, and two other forms of Vishnu
himself appear, the man lion or the Narasimha and
the dwarf or the Vamana. The multiple figures in this
small relief demonstrate the growing complexity of
Vaishnavite iconography, and perhaps provide a clue
to the original dedication of the temple.
Before entering the single-celled shrine through the
decorated doorway, ritual practice probably required
the devotee to circumambulate the temple to view the
three major sculptural panels on the exterior. Each
of the three relieves decorating the main body of the
temple is placed in a niche that consists of decorated
lintels and jabs flanked by pilasters.
The subject matter of the sculptures reveals of the
order in which the devotee would view them. In this
case, the viewing order of the major sculptures would
be the relief of Vishnu Narayana as Anantasayana or
Sesasayana on the South, that of Nara and Narayana
on the east, and the sculpture of Gajendramoksa on
the North, thus moving the devotee in a counter
clockwise direction (Prasavya). This assertion, which
is contrary to the commonly held belief that in Hindu
worship circumambulation is always performed in
a clockwise manner (pradaksina), is based on the
internal message of the reliefs, their accompanying
elements, and an analysis of circumambulation practices in Hindu rituals.
An indication that the devotee began his worship on the South is clearly seen in the depiction of
Ganesha, the elephant-headed God, on a pilaster to
the left of the Anantasayana relief.
As the ‘Overcomer of Obstacles,’ Ganesha is
invoked at the start of worship, and became a standard element in the iconographic programs of Hindu
temples and painting cycles throughout South Asia.
The Ananatasayana subject itself signifi es the beginning, for it is concerned with the birth of Brahma
from the navel of Vishnu.
Since Brahma is the creator of the universe, his
own birth signifi es the beginning of the creations of
the creator. In this form, Vishnu is called Narayana
(Moving on the waters, or abode of man) as He rests
on the serpent in the primeval waters, and He is
described as older than the oldest. In the relief, the
four-armed Vishnu seems to rest comfortably on the
coiled body of the serpent Sesa (Remainder), who is
also called Ananta (endless), and whose hood arches
behind Vishnu’s head like a halo. The God’s wife
Lakshmi (Goddess of fortune) is considered to be the
mediator between the devotee and the Lord.
Garuda stands just to the viewer’s right of Lakshmi, wearing his snake ornaments. In the centre, above,
Brahma can be identifi ed his antelope skin garment,
his three faces (the fourth is implied) and his sitting
atop a lotus after having just emerged from Vishnu’s
navel. He is fl anked by the airborne figures of Indra
and Karttikeya to his right, respectively mounted on
their vahanas, the elephant and peacock, and to his
left, Shiva, with his wife Parvati on his vahana Nandi
and another unidentifi ed figure.
Below, a separate slab bears deeply carved representations of fi ve males and one female. These
are Madhu and Kaitabha at the left with the four
personifi ed attributes of Vishnu at the right. Madhu
and Kaitabha were two demons that sprang from
Vishnu’s ear, while he was asleep, and were about
to kill Brahma (who was emerging from Vishnu’s
navel), when Vishnu destroyed them. In this relief, the
four personifi cations of Vishnu’s weapons (ayudhapurusas) are juxtaposed with the two demons as if
to show Vishnu’s might against them, although the
elegant positioning and grace of the figures hardly
suggest an impending battle. From the right, the
personified weapons are Gadadevi, (the female,
recognized by the mace emerging from the top of
her head), Chakrapurusa (recognized by his chakra
(wheel) hair ornament), Dhanuspurusa (who positions
his right arm as if it were a bow), and Khadgapurusa
(who prepares to draw his sword). On the east, the
major reliefs show two saints Nara (viewer’s right)
and Narayana (viewer’s left), who bring the message of divine love and devotion as an instrument
of spiritualization.

These two, who are considered to be the fourth of
the twenty-two minor incarnations of Vishnu, were
the sons of Dharma (Righteousness) and his wife
Ahmisa (Non-violence). They performed austerities
as part of their devotions, and their ascetic nature is
indicated in the relief by their lack of jewellery and
by the wearing of their hair in topknots (jatamukuta).
Like other ascetics who have forsaken the comforts
of society, they appear in a wilderness setting suggested by the rocky landscape with deer and lions
beneath and bowers of tree above. The figures hold
peaceful attributes in their hands, including the rosary, as symbols of their devotion. A female figure in
the centre above is Urvashi, who was created when
Narayana struck his thigh to demonstrate that he
could not be tempted by celestial nymphs and that
he was steadfast in his devotion.
The niche on the North depicts the story of Gajendramoksa, concerning a king who had been changed
into an elephant (Gajendra) as a curse. One day,
while wadding in a lotus pond, a water beast seized
the leg of the elephant and a tug of war ensued between them that lasted for a thousand years. Finally,
the elephant invoked Narayana and was saved. The
moment just after deliverances is depicted clearly in
the relief, for the water beast (here a naga accompanied by his nagini) is depicted in anjali mudra,
paying respect to the victors. Essentially, the story
is a parable about a devotee who had been cursed
because his untrained intellect was like an elephant’s
and his subsequent deliverance through faith, which
represents the attainment of moksha and serves as
a model to the worshipper at the temple. A crown
born aloft by vidyadharas above signifi es this final
achievement.
The overall message of the temple is thus clearly
indicated in the sculptural program, revealed through
a sequential arrangement of the reliefs, for the
Anantasayana represents the beginning, Nara and
Narayana denote the means through which moksha
may be achieved, and the Gajendramoksha story
expresses the final result.
In contrast to earlier Gupta temples, sculpture has
a much more important role in the overall scheme
of the monument, including the major reliefs as well
as the decoration of the doorway. Still, sculpture is
confi ned to certain areas of the temple and a balance
is struck between ornamentation and the simplicity
of the architecture.
The rather large blocks of stone used to construct
the temple are easily visible, as there has been no
attempt to disguise them with the temple decoration. The beauty of the monument is carried out in
the grace and delicacy of the sculptures themselves,
which represent a high point in the development
of Indic art, reflecting what has come to be known
as the Gupta ideal. Smooth body contours, relived
by moderate amounts of jewellery, peaceful facial
expressions, graceful poses and elegant hairstyles
characterize the figures. Each composition is carefully
balanced, and seems to come alive with the deep,
three-dimensional carving.
The so-called Parvati temple at Nachna-Kuthara
is approximately contemporaneous with the Vishnu
temple at Deogarh, c. A.D. 500 or perhaps slightly
later, and like it, is a notable achievement of Gupta
Art. The name Parvati is undoubtedly a late appellation, for the temple was probably originally
dedicated to Shiva, its forms offer insight into a
completely different temple format in use at the
time, however, for it is a double-storied structure
resting on a plinth with an enclosed passage, the
outer walls of which are lost.
This building is apparently the earliest surviving
example of a structural temple with an enclosed
circumambulatory passage, and thus it is the oldest
known temple of the sandhara class of Hindu temples
that are in fact characterized by this feature. Light
was admitted into the ambulatory by three windows,
one on each side except that of the entrance, which
was open, and some light was also admitted into the
main shrine through windows in the ambulatory passage wall. The second story covered only the temple
shrine (not the passageway) and may have contained
a representation of a deity. Perhaps specifi c ritual
needs necessitated the double story form.
No signs of a sikhara or other high superstructure
exist although the original forms of the roofs of the
temple are unknown. The doorway of the structure,
which is oriented to the West, is among the fi nest in
all Gupta Art, and in general, the trellis like carved
windows and miscellaneous sculptures found at the
site testify to a high quality of workmanship. An
interesting feature of the plinth is the deliberately
rusticated blocks of stone that have been carved to
resemble a rocky landscape, complete with animal life.
The depiction of such stylized landscape, although
unusual in this location, is also seen in the paintings
of Ajanta and in carved renditions of stylized landscape, for example, in the Nara-Narayana relief at
Deogarh. Here, a reference to the temple as a replica
of Kailasha, the mountain abode of the God Shiva,
seems to be implied.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Brick Temples & Terracottas</i></strong></div>  

Although brick and terracotta have been popularly
used since the early discovery of pottery techniques
in ancient India, the fragile nature of the material
has led to the construction of a number of important
monuments, some of which have survived.

The bricks temple at Bhitargaon is one of the bestpreserved examples, in spite of the fact that it was
damaged by lightning in the last century. Its date
is diffi cult to fix as there is no inscriptional or other
evidence of its dedication, but on stylistic ground,
a date of the first half of the fifth century might be
suggested. Burnt bricks joined by mud mortar were
used in the construction of the building, and the walls
reached a thickness of more than two meters.
The temple faces east, as may be determined by the
remains of a portico on that side, and it rests upon a
square plinth (jagati). Each side of the temple has a
projecting bay, creating what is known as a triratha
(three ratha) design. The number three is obtainend
by counting the two sections to the left and right of
the bay, which form the wall of the structure itself,
as well as the outer surface of the bay, which runs
parallel to them. In fi ve rathas, seven rathas, and other
systems where additional bays extend out from the
centre of each preceding bay, the count expands to
include the length of all new parallel wall sections
formed. Such offsetting of the walls of a temple
became a standard feature in many later schools of
architecture. A secondary shrine chamber is present
above the main shrine, although this feature is not
readily apparent from the exterior because of the
rising, vertical shape of the sikhara, which is one
of the earliest extent examples of a northern style
tower. Niches on the exterior of the body of the
temple and the superstructure contained sculpted
panels, some of which are missing and many of
which are partially destroyed. An interesting feature
of the construction in this building is the use of true
arches in the shrines and the porch in preference to
the usual Indic corbelled vault. From examples like
this, it is evident that ancient Indians knew of the
arch at an early date, but elected to use it only on
certain occasions, preferring trabeated forms. The
type of sculptural decoration used in such a temple
is perhaps best seen in a number of terracottas that
are better preserved from other temples, such as that
at Ahicchatra.
Most impressive among them are the nearly human size representations of the river goddesses, the
entrance to the Shiva temple, probably dating from the
late fifth or early sixth century. Although these figures
have been heavily restored, their original animation,
which perhaps exceeds that seen in contemporary
stone carving and may be due in part to the nature
of the terracotta medium, is preserved.
Their positions, turning inward towards the devotee who would enter a doorway, provide a sense of
immediacy to the viewer. The costumes, with the
heavy drapery folds and tight bodies, and the very
fully modelled facial features suggest a departure
from the more tranquil, delicate forms of Gupta stone
sculpture. Each goddess, now easily recognized by
her respective vahana, the makara and the tortoise,
holds a water vessel and is attended by a diminutive
figure holding chattra aloft.
Other terracotta recovered from Northern India
hint at what must have been the widespread and
highly develops art of terracotta sculpture in the
Gupta period. In contrast to the surviving terracotta’s
from the prehistoric and early historic periods, Gupta
terracottas are often large (though not always as large
as the two river goddesses from Ahicchattra).
Many formed panels that were used as decoration
on temples. One such architectural fragment shows
the God Vishnu riding atop his winged vehicle, the
birdman Garuda. Only Vishnu’s two left arms are
preserved, one holds a bow while the other brings
his characteristic conch to his lips, as if the god is
blowing it like a trumpet. The conch, whose fl eeting
sound sometimes serves as a symbol of the transience
of the physical world, here probably indicated a war
call, for the god and his companion seem to be in
battle ready positions that suggest that the relief represents an attack on an unseen adversary. Although
its fi nd spot is not known, the piece is of a type
generally identifi ed with the Uttar Pradesh region,
and such works are generally attributed to the site
of Ahicchatra or, alternatively to Bhitargaon, two of
the most well known and well preserved sites that
have yielded Gupta-period terracottas in Northern
India. But it is likely that the monuments at these
two centres were not unique at the tie of their creation, and that sculptures like this may document a
broadly-based style and art from current throughout
North-Central India.
The curly hair-style of Garuda suggests aesthetic
associations with stone art of the Gupta period,
though the techniques used by the terracotta artist
differ considerably form those of his fellow craftsmen
who worked in stone. The outlines of the eyes and
eyebrows, for example, have been created simply by
using a sharp tool to incise in wet clay, creating a
sense of dynamism and calligraphic line that is not
apparent in works produced by the slower and more
pains taking process of stone carving.
A second terracotta sculpture also probably intended to be used as architectural adornment and
also probably from the Uttar Pradesh region, shows
Rama, the hero of the Ramayana and his younger
brother, Lakshmana, as if in conversation. Rama came
to be considered the seventh incarnation of Vishnu
and stories narrating events involving him are commonly included in the repertoire of subjects adorning

a Vaishnavite temple. However, as a cult deity, he
never achieved the stature of other depicted in art,
and he is generally shown, as here, in a two-armed
form that stresses his human, rather than his godly,
characteristics.
The panel apparently records the period narrated
in the Ramayana when, after Rama had been banished
from the kingdom to which he was rightful heir, he
lived in the company of forest dwellers, rather than
princes; their earlobes, stretched from years of wearing heavy ornaments, are unadorned, and their hair
is tied into simple topknots. The figures are strikingly
naturalistic and life-like, an impression perhaps partly
created by the terracotta medium.
One of the most dramatic and realistic of all the
terracottas surviving from the Gupta period represents
a Shaivite deity. The relief, broken at the waist of
the figure, is from Saheth-Maheth, Shravasti, Uttar
Pradesh, and shows an ascetic whose divine nature is
indicated by the presence of four arms. His emaciated
body, matted locks and pile up hair style (jata), as
well as his lack of jewellery (especially noticeable due
to the distended, pierced earlobes that conspicuously
lack earrings), all signify his ascetic nature.
A very problematic monument that may be discussed along with terracotta remains of the Gupta period is the Mahabodhi temple at Bodh Gaya. Much of
its present appearance is due to renovations as recent
as the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although
the essential elements may have been determined as
early as the late-Kushana or Gupta periods.
As it now stands, the temple consists of a large
central shrine surmounted by a large tower, surrounded by four smaller shrines. These are thought
to have been added fairly recently, although certainly,
the concept of the panchayatana format was welldeveloped by the Gupta period as demonstrated by
the Vishnu temple at Deogarh.
The present tower is probably much taller than
the original superstructure, and its pyramidal profi le,
which differs from the typical, curved, northern-style
sikhara, is possibly also the result of later modifi cations. The type of brickwork and use of certain vaulting
techniques suggest ties to Iranian methods, possibly
introduced into the Indic region by the Kushanas.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chalukya Art</i></strong></div>  

The most splendid achievement of the Chalukyas
was recorded in the realm of art and architecture.
They evolved a new style, which is known as the
“Chalukyan architecture”. It has been described as
belonging to the Vesara style, a combination of the
South Indian or Dravida and the North Indian or
Nagara Styles. The Chalukya art zone of Karnataka
has been described by K. V. Soundara Rajan as “The
Prayaga of coalescing formal trends in temple styles.”
Moreover, the building activities of the period were,
as Percy Brown observes, “clearly the result of an
enthusiasm which was religious in origin and in
intensity of purpose.”
The Chalukya monuments are broadly grouped
into two classes: (a) the rock - cut halls, and (b) the
structural temples. The excavated rock - cut halls are
found at Badami and Aihole. There are four such
cave temples at Badami. Of them the earliest and the
largest is cave No. III excavated during the reign of
Mangalesa and dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The other
caves are of smaller dimensions, and the Cave No.
IV is a Jaina temple. The Badami caves have three
common features, namely, a pillared verandah, a columned hall and a small square cellar or Garbhagriha,
cut deep into the rock.
The cave temples of this age contain some impressive sculptural specimens like Tandavamurti,
Harihara, Ardhanarishvara, Nataraja, Mahishasura
Mardini and so on. The depiction of Vishnu in his
Varaha incarnation is so full of vitality, vigor and
charm that Zimmer wrote, “The age in which it was
fashioned was one of those rare moments in the
history of art in which versatility and restraint were
perfectly balanced”. There are two excavated temples
at Aihole, one Shaiva and the other Jaina. It is said
that the Chalukya genius in excavating cave temples
inspired the Pallavas.
Structural temples were built in large numbers
during this period. The boom in temple building
activity, which the Chalukya rule witnessed is said
to have continued right up to the 13th Century A. D.
The three important centres of Chalukyan architecture
are Aihole, Badami and Pattadakal. Of these Aihole
has been described as “the cradle of the Indian architecture”, and it alone consists of 70 temples. The
Gaudaragudi and the Ladhkhan temple are the oldest
buildings of the Aihole group. The Ladhkhan temple
is a comparatively low, fl at - roofed building, fi fty feet
square. There of its sides are completely enclosed by
walls, and from its fourth side, forming its eastern
front, there is projected an open-pillared porch.
The Durga temple, according to Percy Brown, “is
a Brahmanical version of the Buddhist Chaitya hall,
adopted to suit the service of the former creed”. It
contains a new feature, namely. A vestibule or antarala, which is an intermediate chamber between the
cell and the main hall. It also had a shikhara over
the Garbhagriha, but now it has fallen. The Huchchimalligudi is something of an abridged form of the
Durga temple. There are other important temples
in Aihole, which represent various stages of archi-

tectural evolution, like the Kontigudi, Allibasappa
temple, the Meguti temple, Huchchappayya gudi
and Tarappagudi.
At Badami there are a few important structural
temples like the Naganatha temple and the Malegitti
Sivalaya. At Pattadakal there are ten temples - four
in the northern style and six in the Dravidian style.
Important temples of Pattadakal are the Papanatha
temple, the Sangameshvara temple, the Virupaksha
temple, Mallikarjuna temple, the Galaganatha temple,
the Kashi Vishveshwara temple, the jambulingeshvara
temple and the Kadasiddeshvara temple. Among
them the most famous is the Virupaksha temple. It
was built at the orders of Lokamahadevi, the senior
queen of Vikramaditya II to commemorate his victory
over the Pallavas. It has many features similar to the
Kailasanatha temple of Kanchi.
The Chief architect of the temple was Sri Gundan
Anivaritachari, who held such titles as “Anikapuravastu Pitamaha” and “Tenkanadesiya Sutradhari”. According to Percy Brown, “There is a bold beauty in
the appearance of the Virupaksha temple as a whole,
which is best seen in the exterior”. The main building
measures 120 feet, and the studied grouping of its parts
produces a very pleasant total effect. The heaviness
of the stone work is relieved by an increase in the
amount and quality of the sculpture, which includes
the representations of Shiva, Nagas and Naginis and
the scenes from the Ramayana. As Percy Brown observes, “The sculpture fl ows into the architecture in a
continuous yet disciplined stream…. The Virupaksha
temple is one of those rare buildings of the past in
which the spirit still lingers of the men who conceived
it and wrought it with their hands”.
The scholars have identifi ed a few examples of the
Chalukya painting. “The Temptation of the Buddha”
and “the Persian Embassy” in Cave No. I at Ajantha have been assigned to this period. The Caves of
Badami too have a few fragments of paintings to offer.
But they are not well - preserved. Nevertheless, they
enrich the proud heritage of Chalukyan art, which
has so much to present in terms of variety, novelty,
grace and beauty.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Pallava Art</i></strong></div>  


As in case of many other ruling families in South
Asia, the Pallavas were known in history long before
they rose to prominence. They may be traced as far
back as the second century A.D., but it is not until the
latter half of the sixth century that the family and its
history become less enigmatic, with both inscriptions
and art monuments in stone appearing to initiate a
steady tradition that lasted approximately two hundred years. The Pallavas were heirs to the Andhra
region, but expanded their territories to include much
of the Tamil area to the South.
At times, their empire also reached into the
Deccan and to the frontier of Orissa. The figure
style visible in their art shows clear ties to the
earlier Buddhist traditions developed under the
Satavahanas and Iksvakus, although the Pallavas
were Hindus, primarily Shaivite. The origins of their
architectural forms, however, are more diffi cult to
assess, since precedents in ephemeral materials
are unknown and earlier stone monuments in the
Pallava regions are scarce.
It has been suggested that a strong, traditional
use of stone as a medium for funerary monuments
in the South, as seen in the long megalithic tradition, led to a reticence to employ it in temple
architecture prior to the Pallava period. Perhaps
a study of some of the caves in the Vijayavada
region may some day-shed light on the origins of
Pallava stone monuments.
The burst of artistic energy under the Pallavas,
however, cannot be understood simply in terms
of precedents, for the Pallava empire was blessed
with a number of strong rulers, several of whom
imposed their personalities on the production of
art. Religious developments, particularly Bhakti
cults, must have played a major role in providing
impetus to artistic developments.
In particular, the Alvars, a group of Tamil
Vaishnavite poet saints, and the Shaivite Nayanars
stimulated religious thought, which may have affected the production of art and temple architecture.
Four of the Alvars came from the Pallava country
and their devotional (bhakti) hymns, which were
concerned with the personal experience of the deity rather than metaphysics, must have had great
impact on the society.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Early Phase</i></strong></div> 

        It is usually assumed that the early phase of
Pallava architecture consisted primarily of rock-cut
monuments, while the later phase is dominated
by structural buildings. As a general rule, this is
true, at least in terms of the surviving examples.
However, there is evidence to suggest that structural monuments were produced virtually from the
inceptions of the Pallava tradition and perhaps the
two phases should be considered shifts in emphasis
rather than total abandonment of one from and
the supplanting of another.
Various stylistic designations of Pallava art
and architecture are traditionally associated with
specifi c rulers, who may have been responsible for
the inception of certain stylistic changes.
In general, the developments of the Pallava period include a progression from rather simple forms
to ones of greater complexity. This progression has

been attributed to the growing accumulated skill on
the part of the artisans over the centuries in working
the hard granite stone native to the region. However,
it is likely that the increased complexity in style and
growing elaboration of detail and iconographic forms
were also part of the pan-Indic development of postGupta periods, which in general may be said to be
characterized by such a transformation. Compared
to northern developments, however, the southern
style maintains a much greater simplicity and the
changes are subtler.
The earliest body of surviving architectural monuments of the Pallava period belongs to the reign of
Mahendra Varman I, whose rule in the first three
decades of the seventh century coincided with that
of Pulakesin II of the Early Western Chalukyas.
Originally a Jain, Mahendra Varman was converted
to Shaivism by Saint Appar, and this fact is visible
in the primarily Shaivite dedications of monuments
associated with him.
One monument of the reign of Mahendra I is a cave
temple at Manappattu, which is called Laksitayatana
(temple of Laksita) in its dedicatory inscription. The
name Laksita is a well-known epithet (biruda) for
Mahendra I, and thus, the royal patron, who is also
called Vichitrachitta (curious Minded) in the epigraph,
may be identified.
The inscription further reveals that the cave was
dedicated to the Hindu trinity- Brahma, Vishnu- and
Shiva and calls it a brickless, timberless, metalless and
mortarless mansion. The latter statement is generally
taken to mean that the usual temple would have been
a structural building, made of some of the materials
enumerated in the inscription, and thus it appears
that Mahendra I was the initiator of a new stone
tradition. Whether or not this is the case, the use of
stone was truly unusual at this time, judging from
the lack of extant remains.
The façade of the cave has a low wide, rectangular
appearance with two central pillars and a pilaster
at each side fl anked by large sculpted representations of door guardians. The niches in which the
guardian figures appear repeat the shape of the
space between the columns of the facade with their
square bottoms and tops, octagonal central portions
and bracket like capitals.
A second row of pillars and pilasters within
the cave divides the interior of the main hall into
two lateral sections, while three identical shrines
for housing the images of the trinity (no longer
present) to whom the cave is dedicated are placed
along the rear wall.
The shallowness of the excavation, though not so
pronounce as in other Pallava examples, and the lateral
sectioning is reminiscent of Early Western Chalukya
examples and also suggests ties coast of India, such
as the Undavalli caves or, further North, much earlier
examples from Khandagiri/Udayagiri in Orissa.
The simplicity of the cave and lack of decorative
carving in general characterizes this early Pallava
phase, for the dvarapalas comprise almost the sole
sculptural enhancement. These slender, animated
figures show stylistic affi nities to the earlier traditions
of the Satavahanas and Ikshvaku, demonstrating that
the Pallavas were indeed the heirs to the Andhraregion traditions.
Characteristic of Pallava dvarapala depictions, the
difference between the left and right guardians is
pronounced, for they are placed in different postures.
The near profi le positioning of the body of the left
guardian, possibly deriving from the highly mobile
postures of Ikshvaku representations, anticipates the
still more animated and freely moving figures to be
seen in the Pallava Art.
Also characteristic of Pallava dvarapala type is
the fi erce appearance of the figures, most easily
visible in the bulging eyes of the sample to the left
of the façade.
Also safely attributable of the reign of Mahendra
I on the basis of inscriptional evidence is the upper
cave temple at the hill fort in the heart of the city
of Tiruchirappalli called Lalitankura’s cave after another biruda of Mahendra’s. Its façade, which faces
South, is essentially a refi nement of the Mandagappattu type, with an extra pair of pillars, a broader
intercolumniation (which makes the pillars appear
very slender), and carved medallions decorating the
facts of the pillars.
Although the devotee enters the cave between two
central pillars, the main axis of the temple extends
laterally. This was apparently done so that the shrine
could be placed on the east, in spite of the fact that
the façade was on the south. Such problems in orientation, which were often extremely complex in rock-cut
architecture, may have been one of the reasons for
the eventual abandonment of cave excavations by the
Hindus in favour of structural temples, although not
before they went on to produce some of the most
remarkable achievements of South Asian Art.
The plan shows that the cave consists of two chambers: a larger pillared hall (Mandapa) and a cubical
shrine. A pair of dvarapalas fl anks the entrance to
the shrine, each figure appearing in the animated,
slightly twisted posture typical of Pallava examples.
At the opposite end of the hall, to the west, located
where the entrance would probably have been if
this were a structural example is a relief showing
Shiva as Gangadhara (Bearer of the Ganges River).

As Gangadhara, Shiva is shown receiving in his hair
the heavenly Ganges River as it came to earth as a
result of the penance performed by one Bhagiratha,
who wished to use the holy water to purify the
ashes of his deceased uncles. The lengthy inscription in the cave located on the pilasters adjoining
the Gangadhara panel suggests through the use of
double entendre that the choice of this subject was
deliberate and significant.
In particular, a play on the word Kaveri, which
refers both to the Kaveri river in full view of the cave
and to a courtesan, suggests a parallel between Shiva
and Mahendra I, for Kaveri is described as the beloved
of the Pallava king just as Ganga was the beloved
of Shiva. This implies equation between Shiva and
Mahendra I and their respective river goddesses is
signifi cant in light of other Pallava inscriptional and
artistic evidences.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mamalla Phase</i></strong></div>  

        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
 

The most famous phase of Pallava Art was that
apparently inaugurated during the reign of King Narasimha Varman I, who is known most popularly by
his epithet Mamalla I. This son of Mahendra Varman
I succeeded his father around the fourth decade of
seventh century.
A memorable ruler, Mamalla I sent naval expeditions to Sri Lanka, defeated the Early Western Chalukyas under Pulakesin II, and captured Badami in
642 from the Chalukyas (in retaliation for his father’s
earlier defeat by Pulakesin II), in addition to defeating
other South Indian ruling families. During his reign,
the Chinese pilgrim Hieun-Tsang visited Kanchipuram, then a major Pallava city and capital.
Although the seaport city of Mamallapuram was
named after Mamalla I, he was not its founder, for
Roman coins found in the area and descriptions
by early classical writers much as Ptolemy indicate
that the town had been famous as a seaport at least
since the beginning of the Christian era. In addition,
although it has often been assumed that the majority
of monuments at the site belong to his reign, this
idea has been increasingly challenged.
However, he should be credited with stimulating
the development of Mamallapuram (City of Mamalla)
as a great seaport, vital in the dissemination of South
Indian culture to South-east Asia and commercially
important in the Indian Ocean trade network. Most
of the monuments at Mamallapuram are rock-cut,
carved out of the boulders and cliffs that abound in
the area. These include caves, monoliths and large
sculpted reliefs, although some structural buildings
were also erected.
The site, which covers several square miles, is
virtually a stone city in which boulders and rock faces
have been carved into buildings, animals, sculpted
reliefs and other forms. In spite of the popularity of
the site as tourist resort, and its mention in virtually
every general book on South Asian Art, it has never
been thoroughly studied, analyzed and examined in
order to determine the sequence of monuments and
their place in the development of Pallava art and
architecture.
The vibrancy and animation of Pallava Art is
perhaps nowhere better seen than in the Varaha
mandapa at Mamallapuram. Thought to belong to
the period of Mamalla I, this cave exhibits both the
elaboration of sculptural and iconographic elements
and the refi nement of architectural features associated
with the reign.
A feature of Pallava architecture seen here, and one,
which comes to fruition in Early Chola monuments,
is the presence of tank preceding (or later, surrounding) the monument itself. The use of tanks or other
artifi cial reservoirs of water seem to have played an
important role in Pallava iconographic.
One aspect of such symbolism may have been a
reference to one of the practical aspects of kingship,
that of providing public irrigation reservoirs. Here, the
tank extended across the entire front of the cave, so
that when it was full of water, the devotee would have
had to cross the water to reach the cave. The façade
is based on earlier examples, such as those from the
reign of Mahendra I, but here the pillars and pilasters
are slandered, providing a more open appearance,
and bear cushion-type capitals reminiscent of Early
Western Chalukya types. The seated lions at the bases
are a typical Pallava characteristic, and may be seen
as a precedent for the later animal pillars of South
Indian temples. The cave consists of the rectangular
hall and a shrine that projects forward into the space
of the hall bearing representations of dvarapalas on
the front surface, each of which is contained in a
niche as is typical of the South Indian style.
The simplicity of the architectural features, such
as the plain niches with large figures, characterizes
the Pallava style, which, in contrast to the usual
Northern and Deccan styles, is virtually devoid of
subsidiary elements like vine scroll, gem motifs and
similar designs.
Four major sculptural panels dominate the interior
of the cave. Following a pattern visible in Hindu
art as early as the Gupta period, the reliefs seem to
have double meanings, referring both to the deities
represented as well as to achievements of the king,
presumably Mamalla I. The left wall of the cave
bears a representation of Varaha resting the earth
goddess on his upraised knee. Vishnu as Trivikrama
is depicted on the right wall.

In the Trivikrama incarnation, Vishnu assumed
the form of the dwarf Vamana, who extracted a
promise from Bali, King of Asuras, that he could
have territorial control over the amount of space he
could cover in three paces. Vamana then assumed a
gigantic form and covered the earth world with his
first stride, the mid-world between heaven and earth
with his second and with his third, stepped upon
the head of Bali, thereby sending him to the nether
world of the Asuras. As metaphors, the Varaha and
Trivikrama subjects, while not unique to Pallava Art,
might have been deliberately chosen to refer to specifi c achievements of the king, presumably the defeat
of Pulakesin and the avenging of the defeats to the
Pallavas under his father. The rear walls of the cave
bear images of Gajalakshmi on the left and Durga
on the right, suggesting the notions of prosperity
(Gajalakshmi) and once again victory (Durga). An
interesting aspect of the Durga relief is the figure at
the front left of the composition who is in the act
of self-immolation by decapitation. Such figures are
found during the Pallava period and later in South
Indian art, generally in relationship to Durga images
and may be related to rituals detailed in at least one
Hindu text.
Each relief is characterized by essentially naturalistic scaling, in contrast to what is often seen in Indic
sculptures and by considerable special complexity. In
this latter sense, strong ties to the Iksvaku tradition
are suggested.
This earlier Indian dynasty from the Andhra
region inherited by the Pallavas used sophisticated
devices to imply illusionistic space that were perhaps
originally or partially inspired by Roman art, in the
Varaha relief, this complexity is seen in the two figures at the left who turn inward and are shown in a
rear/profi le view. In the relief of Durga, one figure
is shown from the rear while another is depicted
in profi le. Although arbitrary adjustments of scale
to suit the hierarchic needs prevail in South Asian
Art, essentially naturalistic means are used here to
achieve emphasis.
In the Gajalaksmi panel, for example, the central
figure is emphasized by being placed above the
others on a throne but is depicted in the same scale
as other figures. In all the reliefs the elements are
carved in a fairly three-dimensional manner; space
exists around each figure and the effect is almost as
if the deities and their attendants were indeed in the
presence of the worshipper. The slender figures, with
their narrowed, tapered limbs, betray the Andhra
heritage of Pallava Art and anticipate the typical
style of the South Indian Tamil area to be continued
into the reign of the Cholas and even to the still later
Vijaynagar kings.
Each of the caves at Mamallapuram is unique. The
variety of iconographic types represented in them
indicates an already established wealth of imagery.
This suggests that these excavations were modelled
after structures that no longer exist but which might
have revealed the formative stages of architectural
development.
The Trimurti cave, for example, consists of three
similar shrines entered directly from the exterior with
no porches or mandapas, but unifi ed by the carving
of the exterior of the rock into temple facades with
architectural niches containing fi gurative sculpture.
The name Trimutri literally means ‘triple form.’ But
here it refers to the Hindu trinity of Shiva, Vishnu
and Brahma. Shiva is the most prominent of the
three in this conception, since His is the central
shrine, fl anked by those of Brahma (viewer’s left) and
Vishnu (viewer’s right). The slightly larger size of the
central shrine and its projecting form emphasize its
preeminence. A fourth worship area is designated
at the right of the façade where a set of steps leads
to an image of Durga, although an excavated shrine
is not present.
Durga is shown in an eight-armed form standing
frontally and atop the buffalo head of the defeated
Mahisa in a format typical of Pallava representations
of the subject. Each door to the three shrines is fl anked
by a pair of male figures who serve as dvarapalas.
The back wall of each of the small rectangular shrines
is decorated with a large relief representing the deity
to whom the shrine is dedicated. In the case of the
Shiva shrine, a stone linga is also placed on the fl oor
in front of the image.
This practice of caving the rear wall of the shrine
is typical of Pallava monuments and contrasts with
often bare-walled shrines found throughout Northern
architecture.
In Pallava shrines the linga is usually carved of
a different stone than that of the shrine itself, and
in the case of cave monuments, the linga is added
rather than rock-cut. The façade of this excavation
contrasts with that of the Varaha cave in that it is
not pillared. Instead, it replicates an actual vimana,
that is, a shrine with its superstructures, and is better compared to the freestanding monoliths found
nearby at Mamallapuram. The date of this cave is
unknown but its form suggests that it was excavated
in the middle to late seventh century.
A highly unusual cave has been excavated not far
from the heart of Mamallapuram about fi ve kilometers away at Saluvankuppam, a village that certainly
lies within the ancient boundaries of Mamallapuram.
This excavation, the so-called Yali (Vyala) cave is
distinguished by the eleven vyala (horned lion) heads

that form a kind or ring around the central excavated
chamber and its two fl anking niches. To the viewer’s
left of this area but also on the face of the rock are
carved elephants shrines atop their backs. Although
the main show no trace of any original images within,
these small shrines each bear a much worn depiction
of a four-armed deity.
The original purpose and meaning of the cave,
however, remains unknown. Further, the date of the
excavation is uncertain, although it is probably a monument of the late seventh or early eighth century.
In addition to the variety of architectural types
seen in the caves of Mamallapuram, numerous religious subjects were interpreted anew by the Pallavas
in sculpture and other were introduced for the first
time. A representation of Durga battling the demon
Mahisa in the so-called Mahisasuramardini cave, for
example, is unlike any other depiction of this scene
known in earlier Hindu art. Durga sits astride her
lion vahana while Mahisa, depicted as a human
figure with a buffalo head, appears at the right, as
if recoiling from her attack.
Fallen warriors of Mahisa’s army appear at the
right and lean in the direction of retreat, while
Durga’s forces advance from the left. The naturalistic
rather than hierarchic scaling of the figures, including Durga herself, who is not even as large as her
opponent, heightens the sense of emotion and drama
of the scene. In addition, the figures are in animated
and logical poses that further increase the sense of
actuality. In composition such as this, the Pallava
sculptors achieved a striking balance between the
world of nature and the realm of the divine.
The most impressive sculptural composition at
Mamallapuram is the famous relief that has been
alternately identifi ed as the descent of the Ganga
River or Arjuna’s Penance. This striking work is
believed to have been carved during the reign of
either Mahendrvarman I or that of his son Mamalla.
Measuring nearly thirty meters in length and approximately fi fteen meters in height, it contains a myriad
of figures, animals and other subjects, all of which
are carved on approximately life sized scale. A major
aspect of the composition is the natural feature, which
has been skillfully incorporated into the design and
subject matter of the carving.
Arguments for the interpretation of this impressive scene as either the Descent of the Ganga River
or Arjuna’s Penance are convincing in each case.
Both stories are found in Indian literature, although
different versions appear in various texts.
A strong case for the Descent interpretation is
presented by the central cleft of the composition, with
its naga inhabitants, as a representation of the holy
river, the Ganga itself, in the rainy season, a now
lost receptacle is believed to have fi lled with water,
which could then fall down the cleft into a tank as
a kind of living reenactment of the sacred descent.
Some scholars believe that the tank, at the base of
the relief, would have served as a royal bathing pool
for the king himself.
The arguments for the Arjuna story are less compelling, thought still substantial. In this tale, Arjuna,
one of the fi ve Pandava brothers of the Mahabharata,
performed served austerities in order to enlist Shiva’s
aid (literally, his weapons) in achieving victory in the
pending war between the Pandavas and the Kurus.
Since Arjuna’s penance was performed on the bank of
a river, the arguments can be made that this subject
is represented in the Mamallapuram relief.
Both the Descent and Arjuna’s Penance interpretations would be served well by the figures at the top
of the relief, just to the left of the cleft. The penanceperforming individual, with arms raised and balanced
on one leg, could represent either Bhagiratha, whose
penance brought the Ganga to earth, or Arjuna, whose
penances earned him the aid of Shiva’s weapons.
Shiva, who appears next to the ascetic in a four
art form, attended by his dwarves (ganas), performs
the varada mudra, or gift bestowal gesture, with his
front left hand, a gesture that would be appropriate
to either story.
In each case, too, secondary meanings relating
to the Pallavas themselves, of the type inferred in
other contexts for Pallava art, might be suggested. A
later Pallava inscription mentions that the Pallavas
resembled the Descent of the Ganga as it (too) purifi ed the whole world.
Considering the prominence already accorded the
Gangadhar a murti icon in Pallava art, considerable
credibility is given to this interpretation. Alternately,
Arjuna, the hero of the Mahabharata and leader of
the Pandavas, might serve as a symbol of the Pallavas
themselves for just as Arjuna sought Shiva’s aid in
the war against the Kurus, the Pallavas sought victory in their continuing competition with the Early
Western Chalukyas.
In light of such strong but confl icting evidence, it
might be argued that both meanings simultaneously
were intended by the creators of this remarkable
relief. However, this suggestion, too, would need
further substantiation.
Important features of the relief included the large
elephants at the lower right, the small shrine with
a representation of a deity, the ascetics worship at
the shrine if to converge at the cleft. Considerable
naturalism in pose and individuality in facial features
is seen in the figures, refl ecting some of the concern
with naturalism seen elsewhere in Pallava Art.

As is generally true in the Indian art, the figures
are the principal elements of the compo-sition; it is
the figures that create the volumes and dynamism,
rather than arbitrary devices, such as systems of
perspective or landscape elements, which could be
used to render a context.
Other monuments at Mamallapuram include
the nine freestanding monolithic building scattered
throughout the site. A series of fi ve concentrated in
one group near the sea gives the visitor the remarkable sense of waling through a petrifi ed city.
The origin of the idea of producing complete
replicas of structural buildings, complete both inside
and outside. But, apparently, this mode never became
as popular as the cave format, which did not require
the completion of exterior details other than that of
the façade. Usually, these monoliths have been called
rathas; a complete misnomer since they are clearly not
intended to represent temple carts (rathas), but are
more properly termed vimanas, for each is a distinctive
shrine. The major group of fi ve monoliths has been
traditionally named for the fi ve Pandava brothers (two
of whom have been assigned to one shrine), and their
common wife, Draupadi, although this iconographic
interpretation is clearly erroneous.
Each monolith is unique, yet the fi ve seem to form
a coherent group and must have been carved at about
the same time, probably during the reign of Mamalla
I. Four of the buildings were apparently carved out
of what was once a single outcropping of stone, not
separate boulders, as has often been stated. The fifth,
which is not in a line with the others, was carved
out of a smaller adjoining boulder.
Three large animal sculptures of a lion, an elephant, and a reclining bull, are also associated with
the vimanas. The highest part of the major boulder
was at the South, where the so-called Dharmaraja
ratha is located, and then, the form tapers to the
smaller, so-called Draupadi shrine at the other end.
From unfi nished examples of rock-cut shrines at
Mamallapurm, it may be inferred that the workmen
proceeded from top to bottom, completing each section as they went and using the uncut rock beneath
as a platform upon which to work.
The buildings are important not only their own
right but as documents of what must have been the
contemporary freestanding temple architecture of
the Pallavas.
As such, they provide vital information regarding the genesis of South Indian architectural forms
and indicate that within a short time after the Gupta
period, clear distinction between northern and southern modes were already present, although all of the
stages in these development have not been traced. It
should not be inferred that Mamallapuram examples
represent the beginning of the tradition; rather, they
are manifestations of what must have been already
widespread forms.
The smallest and simplest of the group is the
Draupadi monolith, which is in fact a shrine dedicated
to Durga, distinguished by its curved roof, which is
believed to have been modelled after that of a thatch
proto-type. Square in plan, this single celled, one story
shrine shares a low plinth with the adjacent Arjuna
ratha. The exterior wall decoration consists of pilasters
at each of the four corners and niches containing image. The two niches fl anking the door to the interior
contain life-size female door guardians (dvarapalikas).
The single niches on the three remaining sides, each
contain a representation of Durga. The rear wall of the
interior of the shrines bears a panel showing Durga,
standing, being adored by worshipers, one of whom
is performing a self decapitation like that seen in the
Durga relief in the Varaha cave.
The freestanding lion vahana of Durga is located
outside the shrine. The distinctly feminine nature of
the sculptural program of this small temple contrasts
with the other monoliths, which are male oriented and
suggests the growing emphasis on female imagery.
In the Trimurti cave, Durga’s importance is apparent from the fact that a separate niche had been
provided for her. Here, an entire shrine is allotted
to her worship. Ultimately, South Indian architects
create a separate temple dedicated to the female
principle within the compound of the main temple,
the so called Amman shrine, already visible in nascent form in Pallava monuments. As in Buddhism
of post-Gupta ages, Hinduism of the later periods is
characterized by increasing emphasis on the female
principle or female energy (shakti).
Arjuna’s ratha is not much larger than the Durga
shrine sharing its plinth but it is signifi cantly different in appearance. The pillared front of this square
shrine is reminiscent of the format seen in Pallava
cave architecture. However, the super-structure clearly
refl ects the form of a structural building. The twotiered roof is pyramidal in shape and is capped by
a dome-like element called a sikhara, which is, in
this case, octagonal.
In South Indian architecture, the term sikhara
refers only to this crowning member and not, as in
northern India, to the entire tower comprising the
superstructure of the vimana. Each of the levels of
the roof is decorated with a design of miniature barrel
vaulted roofs (sala) interspersed with chandrasalas
(essentially a rounded arch of the type formed by
the end of a sala), as well as plastered niches, some
of which contain half-length figures. These figures

give the impression that they are partially hidden
due to the viewer’s perspective from below, and like
the freely moving figures in the other niches, again
show the realism characteristic of Pallava Art.
The two sides and rear of the lower story are
carved into a series of niches containing figures, each
separated by pilasters with bracketed capitals. This
format, of figures contained within niches separated
by pilasters and in fact, the plastered wall in general,
is typical of South Indian temple architecture from
this period forward, contrasting strongly with the wall
treatment that characterizes North Indian monuments
of the later periods.
The two sidewalls have six niches each, although
in both cases, the panel nearest the front has been left
unsculpted, while the rear has only fi ve niches.
Male attendants appear at the corners of each,
while the central niches contain images of principal
deities of the iconographic program: Vishnu in the
North, Shiva leaning in Nandi in the South and a
male figure riding an elephant in the East.
This figure has been traditionally identifi ed as Indra
on his elephant mount or sometimes, Subrahmanya
(known also as Murugan), son of Shiva, who is associated with the elephant in South India. While both
of these interpretations bear some credibility, another
suggestion is that the figure represents Aiyanar-Sasta,
a hunter god, known only in South India.
Not only does Sasta commonly ride an elephant,
but also the depictions of Shiva and Vishnu on the
shrine reinforce the Sasta, interpretation since the
god is believed to be the son of Shiva and Vishnu, a
birth which occurred when Vishnu took the feminine
form known as Mohini.
The suggestion of the union between Shiva and
Vishnu, which led to the birth of Sasta, is strengthened
by the presence of mithuna couples in the niches fl anking the principal niches. While mithunas are common
in many other regional schools of South Asian Art,
their near absence in Pallava depictions suggest that
their inclusion here was for the specifi c purpose of
amplifying the iconographic program of the shrine.
Bhima’s ratha is a two storied, oblong building
with a barrel-vaulted roof. The main image within,
although never fi nished, was intended to be a representation of the reclining Vishnu Anantasayana for
which such an elongated structure is appropriate.
Entered on the long side rather than the short
side, this building provides a completely different
effect than the barrel-roofed Buddhist pillared halls;
the somewhat similar roof form may imply only a
common architectural proto-type rather than direct
infl uence of one religion upon another. As in the case
of the Arjuna ratha, chandrasalas and miniature barrel-vaulted shrines decorate the upper levels of the
monument. The pillared façade, with seated lion bases,
typifi es one Pallava architectural format. Even though
it is unfi nished and contains virtually no sculpture,
this monument provides valuable information about
a rare form in Hindu architecture.
The Dharmaraja ratha is the tallest of the group,
but it too remains unfi nished. The inscriptions on
the shrine present confl icting evidence regarding the
date of its excavation, for while the name Narasimha
and a number of birudas suggest that the monument
was begun during the reign of Narasimha Varman
I (Mamalla I), other epigraphs refer to later kings.
However, it is possible that the additional names
were inscribed after work on the shrine was abandoned, for the rather unifi ed style of the monument
suggests that it was the product of a fairly concentrated effort, and thus a monument of the reign of
Narasimha Varman I.
Similar in concept to Arjuna’s ratha although larger
and more elaborate, this shrine also depicts in the
rock-cut form what must have been a popular style
of free standing monument and demonstrates what
was a fully developed southern style of architecture
during this period.
Each of the four sides, if completed, would have
had a pillared façade fl anked by niches containing
sculptures. The southern style superstructure has three
stories that diminish in size as they ascend, forming
a pyramidal profi le, each roof is decorated with the
barrel-vaulted shrines (sala) and chandrasalas and the
whole is capped by an octagonal sikhara.
Like the Arjuna ratha, this building is a clear
replica of the vimana of a southern-style structural
temple, which would, in general, be preceded by
a mandapa and which might typically be enclosed
in a rectangular compound. This form the basis for
what will be seen in Chola, Vijyayanagar and Nayak
period monuments.
While decidedly shaivite in iconography and dedication, the overall scheme of the monument has yet to
be established. One image depicts Narasimha-Varman
I himself, identifi ed by an inscription. It is possible
that his presence was signifi cant in determining the
purpose of the building, for although the king appears
in a two-armed form befi tting his human nature; he
stands in the stiff frontal manner appropriate for
deities, with no fl exion to his body (Samabhanga).
Other portraits of Pallava kings, sometimes even
accompanied by their wives, occur in the art of Mamallapuram. But those at the Adivaraha cave, more
relaxed postures and as accompaniments to the divine
subjects carved in the other compositions of the cave.

Here, Narashimha Varman is almost indistinguishable
in his general demeanor from the deities carved as
part of the same iconographic program. His depiction,
then, must have served a role that was integral part
of the meaning of the monument as a whole.
The placement of his image on the south face of
the building may be revealing in this respect, for in
Hinduism, South is the quadrant of Yama, the god
and judge of the dead. Later South Indian inscriptions of the Cholas reveal that specifi c funerary
monuments called pallippadai were erected for royal
personages. Although conclusive evidence is lacking,
this Pallava building may be an early example of just
such a building.
Another important image of the Dharmaraja ratha
is a sculpted panel in the shrine of the third storey,
which shows Shiva with his wife, Uma (a form of
Parvati), and their son, Skanda, in a group known
as Somaskanda. Here, images of Brahma and Vishnu
fl ank the figures.
The Somaskanda subject becomes a popular Pallava icon that in later contests served as a metaphor
for the Pallava royal family. Since this is the earliest
Somaskanda image known, it is possible that it was
introduced as part of the royal symbolism associated
with this monument in general. The roughly carved
surfaces of this sculpture seems to indicate that the
work would have been completed by plastering and
painting as well.
The last of the group, the Nakula-Sahadeva ratha,
is not in line with the other four, and unlike them,
it faces South, not West. Because it lacks figure carving, it is not possible to determine anything about
its iconography and how it relates to the other four
shrines. However, its forms are extremely important
for the understanding of the development of South
Indian architecture. Its apsidal shade documents a
rare type among the surviving examples of Hindu
temples, but one that is clearly related to Ikshvaku
proto-types like the temple at Chejerla.
That this building is decidedly southern in styles is
seen in the plastered walls (here, with empty niches)
and in the tiered roof with chandrasalas and barrel
vaulted salas. A sala roof caps the whole. It may be
noted that although the exterior rear of the shrine is
rounded, the interior cell is squared.
The rock-cut monuments of Mamallapuram, which
have only been sampled here, demonstrate conclusively a well-developed architectural and iconographic
vocabulary by the 7th century A.D.
This implies a tradition of some long standing
that must predate such remains. The variety of
architectural types, seen in the different roofs, wall
treatments (including plastered wall with and without
sculptures,) and other features all suggest that these
forms had been developing in the early Pallava period
and earlier, although the complete evolution is not
known. Yet, as preserved, like petrifi ed replicas of
vanished monuments, they provide important basis
for the understanding of South Indian developments
to follow.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rajasimha Style</i></strong></div>  

Freestanding structural temples of the Pallava
period provide further information about religious
and artistic developments. The so-called Shore Temple
at Mamallapuram is thought to be a product of the
reign of Narasimha Varman II Rajasimha, who ruled
from about 700 and who is credited with giving a
minor impetus to the production of structural temple,
consisting as it does of three distinct worship areas,
suggest that it was not the product of a unifi ed or
added to after its initial construction, although possibly still within the reign of the one king.
A plan of the temple shows a small square Shiva
shrine, containing a linga and representation of Somaskanda, on the western side of the temple, complex
and slightly to the north.
The main temple also dedicated to Shiva and
containing a linga and relief of Somaskanda in the
central shrine, faces east and consists of a rectangular
walled enclosure, the main shrine and its antechamber,
and a circumambulatory passage between the wall
and the central building.
A third shrine, dedicated to Vishnu as Anantasayana, is aligned with the central shrine and is located
at the western end of the main temple, connecting
two Shiva shrines into a single unit. The sculpture
of Anantasayana was carved in situ from an existing rock and this may explain part of the peculiarity
of the plan. Access to the Vishnu shrine is possible
only from the southern side of the circumambulatory
passage around the large Shiva shrine. The temple
(if this term may be used to describe all three units
as a whole) is thus oriented both to the east and the
west and is apparently dedicated to both Shiva and
Vishnu. Obviously, the east-facing Shiva shrine is the
most important as indicated by its size and the fact
that it has the highest superstructure.
A much smaller tower appears atop the western
Shiva shrine, while none is present over the Vishnu
shrine. An entrance through the temple wall on the
east and another leading into the rectangular temple
compound on the west may be proto-types for the
monumental gateways (gopura) that will characterize South Indian temples in later periods. The compound itself is much ruined due to the ocean spray
and blowing sands that poses a continual threat to

the monument but enough remains on the west to
suggest that water had been channelled into a series
of passages and pools. A related use of water was
seen at the varaha mandapa, and both of these anticipate Chola-period designs. The Shore Temple is
decidedly southern in style, as may be seen in the
pyramidal shape of the superstructure and plastered
wall treatment. The towers in this case are far taller
and slenderer than the superstructure of the Dharmaraja ratha, although this may not indicate a general
trend of the period. Sculptures of dvarapalas, lions
and other figures were fairly abundant at the Shore
Temple, but the sea air has rendered all of them into
virtual shadows of their original forms.
Another monument, more securely attributable to
Narasimha Varman II Rajasimha’s reign, some fortykilometer away from Kanchipuram, is less enigmatic.
Inscriptional evidence on this Shiva temple clearly
indicates that Narasimha Varman II Rajasimha was
the builder of the structure and that he named the
deity enshrined in it (and by implication, the temple)
after him, calling in Rajasimha Pallavesvara, in keeping with a practice that was to become very popular
in South India.
Commonly called the Rajasimhesvara, it is also
known as Kailashnath (referring to Shiva as Lord of
Mount Kailasha), a name that may have arisen from
a verse in one of its inscriptions, which states that
the temple touches the cloud with its top and robs
Kailasha of its beauty.
The temple scheme includes a large rectangular
enclosure containing more than fi fty chapels surrounding the main structure. A second row of small shrines
at the east end of the temple compound suggests that
at some time, perhaps after Rajasimha’s initial period
of construction, a second compound was to have been
built, but this was never completed. At the eastern
end, aligned with the front of the inner compound
wall, a smaller shrine, also dedicated to Shiva, was
built by Rajasimha’s son Mahendra Varman III.
Like his father, Mahendra Varman named the deity of the structure he had built for himself, and it
is called Mahendrasvara or Mahendravarmanesvara
in an inscription. Unlike the separate elements of the
Shore Temples, this smaller shrine was probably part
of the original conception of the temple, for here a
clear break has been allotted for it in the wall, and it
is probable that the son had the shrine built, while his
father was engaged in the original project. Mahendra
Varman’s structure is topped by a sala roof, but the
main sanctuary, Rajasimha’s dedication, bears a typically tired southern form tower. The main building
consists of a principal central shrine with its linga and
enclosed circuma-mbulatory passage, surrounded by
nine smaller shrines, with the two at the eastern end
now accessible only through a pillared hall that was
added at a later date. A detached mandapa to the east
of shrine area was part of the original conception but
is now attached to the main building owing to the
addition of the intermediary mandapa.
An important feature of this temple complex is the
presence of gopuras (gateways) and proto-types in the
enclosure walls. On the west, the central pavilion is
in fact a gateway (although sealed off at present) and
is distinguished from the other pavilion in the row
by its decoration and sala form. Directly opposite the
central shrine in the walled enclosure on the south
and north are chapels that are also visibly different
from the others in the row in their shape, size and
the presence of the sala roof.
These are clearly shrines, not gateways, but serve
as precedents for what will ultimately be the placement of gopuras in line with the main shrine and
for the evolution of the gopura form out of shrines
with sala roofs. The largest of all the chapels aligned
with the main shrine, Mahendra Varman’s temple
on the east, also has a barrel roof and serves as the
equivalent of the other three pavilions, although
much grander.
In contrast to later gopuras, this structure cannot
be traversed; instead, the devotee is diverted to one
side or the other in order to enter the main courtyard. A small gopura on the east provides access to
the fore court of this shrine. The alignment of the
four chapels-cum gopuras is clearly with the main
shrine of the temple rather than with the centre of
the respective walls of the rectangular compound; this
practice explains the often asymmetrical appearance
of the placement of gopuras in later monuments.
In contrast to early Pallava monuments, which
are generally rather simple in their architectural and
sculptural embellishment; this temple complex is
rather lavishly decorated. One major sculptural motif
particularly associated with Rajasimha’s reign is the
rampant lion, which appears almost ubiquitously as
part of the façade decoration of the shrines in the
compound wall. Plaster and paint on the chapel walls
in particular from post-Pallava redecorations of the
temple have obscured much of the other sculptural
work. However, a panel showing ganas and other
creatures on the base of the temple and only thirty
centimeters in height demonstrates the high quality of
carving that must have characterized the workmanship at the temple. These animated figures, crisply
carved and delicately modelled, may be classed with
the fi nest of Indic sculptures.
By far the most common icon enshrined in the
walls of chapels is Somaskanda. While this subject

may have been introduced into Pallava art earlier, it
was certainly popularized during the reign of Rajasimha. A clue to the importance of Somasakanda in
the art of Rajasimha’s time occurs in an inscription
at the temple stating that ‘just as Guha (Skanda, also
called Subrahamanya or Kumara) took birth from
the supreme lord (Shiva)’ thus from lord Ugradanda
there took birth a very pious prince (subrahamanyahkumarah), the illustrious Atyantakama, the chief
of the Pallavas. This the Pallava king Paramesara I
and his son Rajasimha, each referred to by one of his
alternate names, are likened to Shiva and his son in
what appears to be another Pallava synthesis of the
divine and kingly realms.
The Rajasimhesvara temple at Kanchipuram
displays any of the essential characteristics of the
evolving southern architectural style. Some of this
contrast sharply with those of the developing idioms
of the north and Deccan. The storeyed pyramidal
form of the tower above the shrines, the use of a
rectangular enclosure wall with gopuras, and distinctive wall treatment using niches with or without
figures and pilasters are all-important features. These
characteristics form the basis of later southern styles,
although their treatment could be elaborated upon
and modifi ed.
Historically, another aspect of this temple deserves
mention. Inscriptions of the pillars of the deatched
mandapa record that the Early Western Chalukya
king, Vikramaditya II, visited the temple, and was
apparently so impressed by it that he did not carry
off its treasures as spoils of war but instead allowed
them to remain at the temple.

<b>Points to remember</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Under Ashoka (or the Mauryas) all branches of the
fine arts — architecture, sculpture, art of polishing,
art of engineering and art of jewellery —made a
great progress.</li>
        <li>The buildings that were constructed by the Mauryas
put the foreign travellers to mere astonishment,
because of their beauty, design and execution.</li>
        <li>These buildings were mostly that of wood and so
most of them could not come down to us but the
Greek writers have left us impressive accounts of
them.</li>
        <li>They tell us that the royal palaces constructed by
the Mauryas were 'the finest and grandest in the
whole world.'</li>
        <li>The Chinese traveller Fahein also remarked, that
these palaces are so beautiful and excellent that
they appear to be the creation of gods rather than
of men.</li>
        <li>The Mauryas, and especially Ashoka, built a large
number of stupas throughout their empire to
enhrine the relics of Buddha.</li>
        <li>Buddhist traditions credit Ashoka with building of
84,000 stupas.</li>
        <li>A stupa is a dome- like structure which is resting
on a round base and is made of brick or stone.</li>
        <li>Some of these stupas still survive and rouse our
curiosity even upto this day.</li>
        <li>The most famous are those of Sanchi and Barhut.</li>
        <li>The Sanchi Stupa is at present 77½ feet high and
121 ½ feet in diameter.</li>
        <li>A massive stone railing, supposed to be added later
on encloses the whole structure.</li>
        <li>Ashoka is also credited to have built many
monasteries and cave dwellings for the monks.</li>
        <li>The caves were cut out of hard rocks but their walls
were softened and polished in such a manner that
they still shine like a mirror.</li>
        <li>According to Kalhan, the author of Rajtarangini, it
was Ashoka who laid the foundation of Srinagar.</li>
        <li>Another town supposed to have been buit by
Ashoka was Devapattan in Nepal.</li>
        <li>The art of sculpture (or stone-cutting) reached a
high watermark under Ashoka.</li>
        <li>The pillars, figures of animals and birds, and
statues cut out of solid rocks are also exquisite in
their beauty that they have won general admiration
throughout the world.</li>
        <li>Ashoka’s pillars are perhaps the best example of
the Mauryan art.</li>
        <li>These pillars are 50 to 60 feet in height and about
50 tons in weight.</li>
        <li>How such high and heavy pillars were chiselled
out of one single rock is still a wonder.</li>
        <li>The stone is chiselled and cut with such an accuracy
that it is generally said that they appear to have been
designed by giants and executed by jewellers.</li>
        <li>Each pillar is surmounted by a capital or a head
which is decorated with figures of animals like the
lion, the bull, the elephant or the horse.</li>
        <li>The high artistic merits of the figures, which exhibit
realistic modelling and movements are of a very
high order.</li>
        <li>The Capital of the Sarnath pillar is the most
magnificent.</li>
        <li>The figures of four lions, standing back to back,
are so natural and exquisite that they have been
praised all over the world.</li>
        <li>According to Dr. V.A. Smith, “It would be diffi cult
to find in any country an example of ancient animalsculpture superior or even equal to this beautiful
work of art, which successfully combines realistic
modelling with ideal dignity and is finished in
every detail with perfect accuracy.”</li>
        <li>This sculpture of four-lions has been adopted by
the modern Indian currency.</li>
        <li>The walls of the caves, that have been found near
Gaya, are so brightly polished that they shine like
a mirror.</li>
        <li>The pillar which now stands in Feroze Shah Kotla
bears such a fi ne polish that some observers have
been misled to the belief that it was made of metal
rather than of stone.</li>
        <li>For instance, Bishop Habere remarked after
seeing this pillar, “It was a high black pillar of
cast metal.”</li>
        <li>During the reign of Ashoka huge blocks of rocks
were cut and chiselled into monolithic and
exceptionally fi ne pillars, some of which were 50
tones in weight and about 50 feet in height.</li>
        <li>These huge blocks of rocks were perhaps cut from
the Chunar hills of hard stone.</li>
        <li>How these pillars were taken to such distant places
is nothing less than a miracle.</li>
        <li>A high degree of knowledge of engineering must
have been required both in cutting these huge
blocks and later on removing them hundreds of
miles away, sometimes to the top fo a hill.</li>
        <li>In 1356 A.D. Feroze Shah Tughlak decided to
remove the Topra pillar from Ambala district to
Delhi.</li>
        <li>It is said that he had to prepare a special carriage
with 48 wheels and employ about 8,400 men to
carry this one single pillar.</li>
        <li>In other words, he employed about 200 men to
move a single wheel.</li>
        <li>This example would clearly indicate that the art of
engineering had greatly developed in the Mauryan
period.</li>
        <li>The art of jewellery also made a great progress
during the Mauryan period.</li>  
        <li>In the Taxila ruins some very fi ne specimens of
ornaments belonging to the Ashoka’s period were
found.</li>
        <li>Their study revealed artistic beauty of the highest
order.</li>
        <li>The Greeks had a great hand in the development
of the so-called Gandhara School of Art which
developed on the North-West.</li>
        <li>Now, in place of symbols for depicting Lord
Buddha, his life like statues and images began to
be made in large numbers.</li>
        <li>The later Gandhara school, depicting on stones,
scenes from the life of Buddha is beyond doubt
inspired by Hellenic ideals.</li>
        <li>The Gandhara art is sometimes called the Greeco
Buddhist art because while its subjects and ideas
remained Indians, its style, physical features and
dress were all after the Greek fashion.</li>
        <li>It has been pointed out by some historians that
the Indians also learnt the construction of caves
especially the rock-cut caves from the Greeks.</li>
        <li>Some of such caves can still be found in this country
especially in the North-West of India.</li>
        <li>The Indian architecture is supposed to be some
what affected by the Greeks but nothing defi nite
can be said in this direction because no notable
building belonging to the Indo-Bacterian or IndoParthian rulers has yet been unearthed except
some 'unembellished (unde-corated) walls of some
houses and a temple at Taxila.'</li>
        <li>Some decorative styles were no doubt adopted by
the Indian architects and builders from their Greek
contemporaries.</li>
        <li>The Gandhara school of art occupies a high place in
the history of the Indian Art.</li>
        <li>At one time it was thought that India had only one
school of art, and that was the Gandhara school
of Artd.</li>
        <li>It is even believed that this school of art produced
far-reaching effects on the art of such distant
countries as China, Japan and Central Asia.</li>
        <li>As most of the statues and sculptures made under
this school have been discovered in Gandhara, this
art has come to be called Gandhara school of Art,
after the name of the country of its origin.</li>
        <li>The Gandhara style might have been originated
under the Indo-Bactrian and Indo-Parthian rulers
but it was under Kanishka that it made a rapid
development.</li>
        <li>Under this school of art life-like statues of Buddha
began to be made in large numbers whereas under
the older schools (of Sanchi and Bharhut) no statues
and images of Buddha were made.</li>
        <li>His existence was shown only by symbols such
as foot-prints, the Bodhi-tree, a vacant seat or the
umbrella.</li>
        <li>Much attention was paid in depicting each and
every fold and turn of the dress.</li>
        <li>Rich ornaments, costumes and drapery were used
most enthusiastically in this school and much
attention was paid to imparting physical beauty
to the artistic specimens.</li>
        <li>A great importance was attached to refineness and
polish in the Gandhara School of art.</li>
        <li>The technique and forms applied were Greek in
nature but the ideas, inspirations and subjects
were all Indians.</li>
        <li>Chalukya rulers were not only great conquerors
but also great builders and patrons of art. They
were mostly Hindus by faith and so they build a
large number of beautiful temples in honour of the
Hindu gods- Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, etc.</li>
        <li>Some of these temples have life- like statues of these
deities, which are superb both in their design and
execution.</li>
        <li>The Chalukya rulers built various types of
temples- some of them are excavated out of soil
rocks. Some are brick- temples while there are
others which are ‘structural buildings of stone
fi nely joined without mortar.</li>
        <li>The Vishnu temple at Badami, the Jain temple at
Meguti, the Vishnu temple at Aihole, the Shiva
temple at Pattadakal, the temple of Kasivivesvara
at Lakkundi, the Mahadeva temple at Ittagi and
the Saraswati temple at Gadag are some of the
most important temples built by the Chalukya
monarchs.</li>
        <li>Almost every little town within the Chalukya empire
has got some remains of one temple or the other.</li>
        <li>According to Prof. N.N. Ghosh “There is hardly a
village (within the Chalukya boundaries) that has
not some remains of the Chalukyas, both the early
and the later ones, were great builders.”</li>
        <li>All these temples referred to above have special
qualities of their own. The one built at Badami
presents one of the earliest examples of the
Chalukya art.</li>
        <li>The temple, which was built by Mangalesa
Chalukya towards the end of the 6th century A.D.
in honour of Vishnu is completely excavated out of
solid rocks and shows the Chalukya art at its great
height.</li>
        <li>Another stone temple of great merit is at Meguti.
According to Prof. Ghosh “It shows the art of stonebuilding in its perfection.”</li>
        <li>The Vishnu temple at Aihole is not only the best
preserved temple but it is also the most important
temples from the historical point of view.</li>
        <li>It contains the famous Aihole Inscription of
Vikramaditya II, which has thrown a good deal of
light on the Chalukya dynasty.</li>
        <li>This temple is also known for its extraordinary fi ne
sculptures and tow superb high flying statues of
Devas which are excellent in design.</li>
        <li>The Virupaksha temple at Pattadakal, according toHavell, 'combines the 
            statelines of the classic design of Europe with ferried (burning) imagination of
Gothic art.'</li>
        <li>This temple also bears an inscription of great
importance.</li>
        <li>The Mahadeva temple at Ittagi also bears an
inscription and has elaborately designed pillars.</li>
        <li>The Kasivisvesvara temple at Lukkundi and
Saraswati temple at Gadag are two other elaborately
decorated temples of the Chalukyas.</li>
        <li>An important characteristic of the Chalukyan
temples is that every attempt is made to decorate
every part of them and consequently there is
'crowded abundance of minute details which
covers the surface'.</li>
        <li>The Chalukya rulers also patronised the art of
painting. Both Ajanta and Ellora were situated in
their dominions, and at least some of the famous
Ajanta cave frescoes were probably executed in the
time of the Early Chalukya rulers.</li>
