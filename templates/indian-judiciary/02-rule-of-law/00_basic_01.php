<h3>Rule of Law</h3>

The Rule of Law- is a basic requirement for a
democratic government. And for the maintenance
of rule of law, there must be an independent and
impartial judiciary. It is embodied in the concept
of rule of law that equality before the law or equal
protection of the laws is ensured to all citizens,
and every citizen is protected from arbitrary
exercise of power by the State. Thus in a state
professing the rule of law, the aim should be to
provide for a system which secures to its citizens
adequate procedure for the redress of their
grievances against the state before forums which
are able to administer justice in an impartial
manner without any fear or favour.

Each country has devised its own system to
ensure the maintenance of the rule of law. The
Indian Constitution embodies the modern concept
of the rule of law with the establishment of a
judicial system which should be able to work
impartially and free from all influences. The rule
of law pervades over the entire field of
administration and every organ of the State is
regulated by the rule of law. The concept of the
rule of law would lose its vitality if the
instrumentalities of the state are not charged with
the duty of discharging their function in a fair and
just manner. It has been held that the rule of law
pervades the Constitution as its basic feature and
cannot be taken away even by an amendment of
the Constitution.

Fundamental Rights: Indian Constitution
enshrines the fundamental rights to individuals
which operate as limitations on the exercise of
powers by the government. If there is an
infringement of the Fundamental Rights of a
citizen, the rule of law requires that there should
be a proper forum for the address of his grievances.
For this purpose, it is provided that an aggrieved 
person may even move the Supreme Court directly
by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of
his fundamental rights. The rule of law under the
Constitution thus serves the needs of the people.
It recognises the social reality and tries to adjust
itself to it from time to time avoiding the
authoritarian path.
It is specifically provided that the state shall
not deny to any person, equality before the law
or the equal protection of law. The absence of
arbitrary power is the first essential of the rule of
law upon which the Indian constitutional system
is based. In a system governed by the rule of law,
discretion, when conferred upon executive
authorities, must be confined within clearly defined
limits. This means that decision should be made
by the application of known principles and rules
and, in general, such decisions should be predictable
and the citizen should know where he stands.
Directive Principles: The Indian Constitution
lays down in Part IV the Directive Principles of
State Policy. It enjoins to bring about a social order
in which justice, social, economic and political,
shall prevail all the institutions of national life. It
directs it to work for an egalitarian society where
there is no concentration of wealth, where there
is plenty, where there is equal opportunity for all,
to education, to work, to livelihood, and where
there is social justice.
It is true that the representatives of the people
are charged with the responsibility of realising the
aims and objectives of the Constitution, but left to
themselves there is a possibility that uncontrolled
and unrestricted power might lead to an
authoritarian State. It is here that the DPSPs. come
into picture & serve as the beacon lights for both
the politicians as well as the judiciiary who is
responsible for ensuring that the govt. of the day
respects the rights of the people & acts as per rule
of law.
