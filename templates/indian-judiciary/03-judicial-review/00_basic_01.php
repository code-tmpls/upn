<h3>Judical Review</h3>

Judicial Review means the power of the courts
to declare a law made by legislature beyond the
powers given to it by the Constitution as ultravires
of the Constitution and hence void. Judicial review
is a powerful weapon to restrain any
unconstitutional exercise of power by the
Legislature and the Executive. The only check on
the exercise of power by the judiciary, however,
is the self-imposed discipline of judicial restraint.
The doctrine of judicial review does not permit the
court to direct or advise the executive in matters
of policy or to sermonize vis-Ã -vis any matter
which under the Constitution lies within the
sphere of Legislature or the Executive, provided
those authorities do no transgresses their
constitutional limits or statutory powers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Review in India</i></strong></div>

The phrase "judicial review" is not anywhere
used in the Indian Constitution. But, the framers
of Indian Constitution intended this power to be
exercised by the courts while interpreting any law
passed by the Parliament or State-legislatures.
Till 1967 the Supreme Court had exercised the
power of judicial review with restraint. But in
sGolaknath case, 1967, the Supreme Court
overruled previous decisions and declared that the
Parliament could not amend the Constitution to
take away or abridge any of the Fundamental
Rights. This decision resulted in a public
controversy over the sovereignty of Parliament.
Then, came two other judgments of the Supreme
Court - the Bank Nationalization case and the
Privy Purses case. These cases also questioned the
supremacy of the parliament. Soon thereafter in
a newly elected Lok Sabha following the 1971
elections, the Parliament passed 24th , 25th and
26th constitution Amendment bills to neutralise
the effect of the three above-mentioned Supreme
Court judgments. In the famous Keshavanand
Bharati Case, 1973, the Supreme Court reversed
the Golaknath Case ruling and upheld Parliament's
right to amend the Constitution including the
Fundamental Rights, but not the 'basic structure
or framework' of the Constitution. The Supreme
Court holds the view that the Parliament is not
omnipotent to change the basic structure of the
Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of the 42nd Amendment</i></strong></div>

The 42nd Amendment enacted during the
Emergency made far-reaching changes to curtail
the powers of the courts and to make the Parliament
sovereign. Firstly, the 42nd Amendment stated
that no amendment to the Constitution could be
questioned in a Court of Law. And "for the
removal of the doubts, it is hereby declared that
there shall be no limitation what ever on the

constituent power of Parliament to amend by way
of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of
this constitution." In this manner, through this
Amendment the Supreme Court's power to judicial
review of constitutional amendments was taken
away to establish the complete and total
sovereignty of Parliament. The Amendment stated
that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A High Court cannot pronounce invalid any
Central law,</li>
<li>The Supreme Court shall not pronounce a
State law as unconstitutional unless a Central
law has also been challenged.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

Further, the minimum number of judges of the
Supreme Court who shall sit to determine the
constitutional validity of any Central or State law
shall be seven and in the case of High Court, five.
It was also stated that a majority of not less than
two- thirds of the judges hearing such a case must
agree before a law is declared invalid. But after
this the 43rd Amendment was passed which
restored the pre-emergency position of the Supreme
Court's power of judicial review over laws passed
by state legislatures and Parliament. As far as
Parliament's sovereignty with regard to amending
the Constitution is concerned, there is no change.
The power of Parliament to amend the Constitution
exists as under the 42nd Amendment, however
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Minerva
Mills case in May 1980 was a setback to the
position of unlimited powers claimed by the
Parliament to amend any part of Constitution.
This judgment recognized only limited powers of
the Parliament to amend the Constitution without
altering the basic structure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Provisions</i></strong></div>

Article 32 of the Constitution makes the
Supreme Court the ultimate guardian of the
Fundamental Rights of the citizens and clothes it
with the power to issue writs for their enforcement.
Article 142 gives the Apex Court wide powers to
proonounce orders as are necessary in the interest
of justice for doing complete justice in any cause
or matter before it, in addition to its powers to
make decisions under article 131 to 136. Article
142 contains no words of limitation and has
enabled the court to intervene in a wide variety
of cases. Starting with Union Carbide Corpn. v.
Union of India, (1991) Supreme Court has made
significant strides to maintain the rule of law,
which is the bedrock of our Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Significance of Judicial Review</i></strong></div>

It is said that there is a shift from the traditional
judicial role to judicial activism, from passivity to
creativity, in that the courts are taking judicial
notice of the changing needs of the society and
evolving new tools for redressing public wrongs.
Public Interest Litigation based on the enlarged
concept of locus standi, has developed on account
of judicial activism. In several matters, the Courts
have provided relief through the 'judicial review',
such as, in cases concerning the deprived or
disadvantaged sections of the society, prisoners,
environmental degradation, closure of polluting
industries in Delhi, encroachments and
unauthorised constructions, immediate medical
aid by government hospitals to seriously injured
persons, reparations to riot-victims, professional
college admissions, contempt involving
disobedience or imperviousness to court orders,
corruption in high places, or malfeasance of public
servants (including Ministers) involving breach of
public trust, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

Undoubtedly, the maxim "the King can do no
wrong" or absolute immunity of the government
is not recognised in our legal system, rather
independence and impartiality which are the two
basic attributes essential for proper discharge of
judicial functions are emphasized upon. In fact,
"judicial activism" is nothing but Judiciary's
insistence that the rule of law must guide the
Legislature and the Executive in enacting or
enforcing the laws of the land. Judicial review is
a constitutionally embraced concept, which has
been streesed upon in cases like Minerva Mills
Ltd.v. Unin of India, S.P.Sampath Kumar v.
Union of India. Subhesh Sharma v. Union of
India,etc. Judicial review, in India is a power born
from the first principles of democratic
constitutionalism & is today an area of great
promise. It is an essential part of the rule of law.
However, it must also be kept in view that the
actual governance of the country is certainly the
sphere of the Executive which is accountable to
Parliament. Neither the Executive nor the Judiciary
should exceed their legitimate functions. Only 
then the two organs of the State can function
harmoniously. Self restraint is the key to the whole
issue.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT QUESTIONS ARE RAISED AGAINST
JUDICIAL REVIEW?</i></strong></div>

Following are the main questions raised by the
critics of Judicial Review:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the judiciary expanding its powers at the expense of the executive?</li>
        <li>Are the courts reaching the boundaries of the rule
of separation of powers?</li>
<li>Do the new dimensions, which the judicial review
has brought in, are attempts to tread on territory
hitherto reserved for the Executive?</li>
<li>Is there a government by the Judiciary, unsupported by any popular mandate?</li>
<li>What is the line where the courts will stop?</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
These questions often agitate the minds of thinking people. The public opinion is divided on these
issues and the biggest question that remains unanswered is - "whether the judiciary has exceeded the
limits of its legitimate functions?"
