<h3>Judical Review</h3>

Judicial Review means the power of the courts
to declare a law made by legislature beyond the
powers given to it by the Constitution as ultravires
of the Constitution and hence void. Judicial review
is a powerful weapon to restrain any
unconstitutional exercise of power by the
Legislature and the Executive. The only check on
the exercise of power by the judiciary, however,
is the self-imposed discipline of judicial restraint.
The doctrine of judicial review does not permit the
court to direct or advise the executive in matters
of policy or to sermonize vis-à-vis any matter
which under the Constitution lies within the
sphere of Legislature or the Executive, provided
those authorities do no transgresses their
constitutional limits or statutory powers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Review in India</i></strong></div>

The phrase "judicial review" is not anywhere
used in the Indian Constitution. But, the framers
of Indian Constitution intended this power to be
exercised by the courts while interpreting any law
passed by the Parliament or State-legislatures.
Till 1967 the Supreme Court had exercised the
power of judicial review with restraint. But in
sGolaknath case, 1967, the Supreme Court
overruled previous decisions and declared that the
Parliament could not amend the Constitution to
take away or abridge any of the Fundamental
Rights. This decision resulted in a public
controversy over the sovereignty of Parliament.
Then, came two other judgments of the Supreme
Court - the Bank Nationalization case and the
Privy Purses case. These cases also questioned the
supremacy of the parliament. Soon thereafter in
a newly elected Lok Sabha following the 1971
elections, the Parliament passed 24th , 25th and
26th constitution Amendment bills to neutralise
the effect of the three above-mentioned Supreme
Court judgments. In the famous Keshavanand
Bharati Case, 1973, the Supreme Court reversed
the Golaknath Case ruling and upheld Parliament's
right to amend the Constitution including the
Fundamental Rights, but not the 'basic structure
or framework' of the Constitution. The Supreme
Court holds the view that the Parliament is not
omnipotent to change the basic structure of the
Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of the 42nd Amendment</i></strong></div>

The 42nd Amendment enacted during the
Emergency made far-reaching changes to curtail
the powers of the courts and to make the Parliament
sovereign. Firstly, the 42nd Amendment stated
that no amendment to the Constitution could be
questioned in a Court of Law. And "for the
removal of the doubts, it is hereby declared that
there shall be no limitation what ever on the

constituent power of Parliament to amend by way
of addition, variation or repeal the provisions of
this constitution." In this manner, through this
Amendment the Supreme Court's power to judicial
review of constitutional amendments was taken
away to establish the complete and total
sovereignty of Parliament. The Amendment stated
that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A High Court cannot pronounce invalid any
Central law,</li>
<li>The Supreme Court shall not pronounce a
State law as unconstitutional unless a Central
law has also been challenged.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

Further, the minimum number of judges of the
Supreme Court who shall sit to determine the
constitutional validity of any Central or State law
shall be seven and in the case of High Court, five.
It was also stated that a majority of not less than
two- thirds of the judges hearing such a case must
agree before a law is declared invalid. But after
this the 43rd Amendment was passed which
restored the pre-emergency position of the Supreme
Court's power of judicial review over laws passed
by state legislatures and Parliament. As far as
Parliament's sovereignty with regard to amending
the Constitution is concerned, there is no change.
The power of Parliament to amend the Constitution
exists as under the 42nd Amendment, however
the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Minerva
Mills case in May 1980 was a setback to the
position of unlimited powers claimed by the
Parliament to amend any part of Constitution.
This judgment recognized only limited powers of
the Parliament to amend the Constitution without
altering the basic structure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Provisions</i></strong></div>

Article 32 of the Constitution makes the
Supreme Court the ultimate guardian of the
Fundamental Rights of the citizens and clothes it
with the power to issue writs for their enforcement.
Article 142 gives the Apex Court wide powers to
proonounce orders as are necessary in the interest
of justice for doing complete justice in any cause
or matter before it, in addition to its powers to
make decisions under article 131 to 136. Article
142 contains no words of limitation and has
enabled the court to intervene in a wide variety
of cases. Starting with Union Carbide Corpn. v.
Union of India, (1991) Supreme Court has made
significant strides to maintain the rule of law,
which is the bedrock of our Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Significance of Judicial Review</i></strong></div>

It is said that there is a shift from the traditional
judicial role to judicial activism, from passivity to
creativity, in that the courts are taking judicial
notice of the changing needs of the society and
evolving new tools for redressing public wrongs.
Public Interest Litigation based on the enlarged
concept of locus standi, has developed on account
of judicial activism. In several matters, the Courts
have provided relief through the 'judicial review',
such as, in cases concerning the deprived or
disadvantaged sections of the society, prisoners,
environmental degradation, closure of polluting
industries in Delhi, encroachments and
unauthorised constructions, immediate medical
aid by government hospitals to seriously injured
persons, reparations to riot-victims, professional
college admissions, contempt involving
disobedience or imperviousness to court orders,
corruption in high places, or malfeasance of public
servants (including Ministers) involving breach of
public trust, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

Undoubtedly, the maxim "the King can do no
wrong" or absolute immunity of the government
is not recognised in our legal system, rather
independence and impartiality which are the two
basic attributes essential for proper discharge of
judicial functions are emphasized upon. In fact,
"judicial activism" is nothing but Judiciary's
insistence that the rule of law must guide the
Legislature and the Executive in enacting or
enforcing the laws of the land. Judicial review is
a constitutionally embraced concept, which has
been streesed upon in cases like Minerva Mills
Ltd.v. Unin of India, S.P.Sampath Kumar v.
Union of India. Subhesh Sharma v. Union of
India,etc. Judicial review, in India is a power born
from the first principles of democratic
constitutionalism & is today an area of great
promise. It is an essential part of the rule of law.
However, it must also be kept in view that the
actual governance of the country is certainly the
sphere of the Executive which is accountable to
Parliament. Neither the Executive nor the Judiciary
should exceed their legitimate functions. Only 
then the two organs of the State can function
harmoniously. Self restraint is the key to the whole
issue.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT QUESTIONS ARE RAISED AGAINST
JUDICIAL REVIEW?</i></strong></div>

Following are the main questions raised by the
critics of Judicial Review:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the judiciary expanding its powers at the expense of the executive?</li>
        <li>Are the courts reaching the boundaries of the rule
of separation of powers?</li>
<li>Do the new dimensions, which the judicial review
has brought in, are attempts to tread on territory
hitherto reserved for the Executive?</li>
<li>Is there a government by the Judiciary, unsupported by any popular mandate?</li>
<li>What is the line where the courts will stop?</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
These questions often agitate the minds of thinking people. The public opinion is divided on these
issues and the biggest question that remains unanswered is - "whether the judiciary has exceeded the
limits of its legitimate functions?"
</div>
</div>


</div>
<div>
<h3>Judiciary VS. Legislature</h3>

Conflict between legislature and the judiciary
has often given rise to anxiety and grave concern
to the governments at the Centre and the States.
The executive heaves a sigh of relief when the
conflict gets resolved or the matter is put in the
cold storage after initial heat over the powers each
of these wings of the States enjoy under the
Constitution subsidies. There are a number of
cases where friction between the two has arisen.
There has been a perennial conflict not only inndia
but also in England about the respective rights and
privileges of Members of Parliament and the
Judiciary.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Indian Scene</i></strong></div>

In India, under the written Constitution, the
three organs of the Government, viz. the
Legislature, judiciary and the executive, have to
function within their respective powers and none
of them can exceed its powers. Whether, any one
of these organs has exceeded its powers or not, is
a matter of judicial interpretation. In several
decisions of the Supreme Court, it has been held
that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter
of the Constitution and its interpretation is binding
on all courts, tribunals and authorities in this
country. Under article 141 of the Constitution, the
law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on
all parties. So, if there is any doubt that any
particular organ of Government has exceeded its
powers, the interpretation ultimately rests with
the Supreme Court.
Even the powers granted by the Constitution
to the Members of Parliament and the Assembly
are subject to other provisions of the Constitution.
They cannot act arbitrarily; nor can they deprive
the citizens of their fundamental rights arbitrarily.
There is a provision in the Constitution for codifying
the laws relating to the privileges of legislatures
and if Parliament makes such a law that infringes
with Article 13 of the Constitution; validity of the
same can be tested before the Supreme Court in
the same manner as any other legislation. So, the
scheme of the Constitution does not contemplate
that Parliament or a State Legislature is not at all
liable to be questioned for any violation of law
since rule of law is the corner-stone of the
Constitution of India. Though Legislatures in
India have plenary powers they function within
limits prescribed by the material and relevant
provisions of the Constitution.
<div><b>Main areas of conflict</b></div>

Following are the Main areas of conflict
between the Legislature and the Judiciary:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Existence, extent and scope of Parliamentary
privileges and power of Legislatures to punish
for contempt,</li>
<li>Decisions given by the Presiding Officers of
Legislatures under the Anti-defection law;
and</li>
<li>Decision given by the Presiding Officers of
Legislatures in administration of their
Secretariats.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

With an aim to reduce the conflict between the
Legislature and Judiciary, it is recommended that
the Presiding Officers should not be made party
personally in a suit pertaining to the administrative
matters of their Secretariats. The suit, in turn,
could be filed against the concerned Legislature 
through the Secretary of the Legislature who
could represent the legislature in the Court and if
necessary, appear personally in the case. But, it is
NOT recommended to enlarge the scope of article
361 to provide the same protection to the Presiding
Officers as enjoyed by the President of India and
the Governors of States. Some critics opine that
there was no need to codify the privileges of the
Legislature. This argument is understandable as it
is based on the apprehension that it will give rise
to more judicial interference. On the other hand,
from the point of view of citizens, the codification
of privileges of Legislatures may be highly desirable,
a view-point which is strongly supported by the
press and the media. It is a matter of satisfaction
that there have not been too many cases where
the Legislature was called upon to exercise its
powers for punishing for the breach of privilege
and contempt of the House. But, the relations
between legislature and judiciary in the context of
privileges and immunities would continue to cause
some uneasiness till the time grammar and spirit
of democratic form of government became the
grain of Indian society.
Anyways, it is needless to say that the strength
of the democracy lies in the existence of harmonious
relations among different organs of the State, in
particular, Legislature and Judiciary. These relations
can be harmonized through informal mechanisms
and mutual understanding. After all, every detail
relating to the functioning of democracy cannot
be put in black and white.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE POWERS, PRIVILEGES AND
IMMUNITIES OF MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURES?</i></strong></div>

The relevant provision of the Constitution relating
to powers, privileges and immunities of the members of Parliament and State Legislatures is incorporated under Article 105 & Article 194 respectively.
These Articles provide that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Subject to the provisions of the Constitution
and to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of the Legislatures, there
shall be freedom of speech in the Legislature of the Union and of every State.</li>
<li>No member of any Legislature shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by
him in the Legislature or any committee
thereof, and no person shall be so liable in
respect of the publication by or under the
authority of a House of such a Legislature of
any report, paper, votes or proceedings.</li>
<li>In other respects, the powers, privileges and
immunities of a House of any Legislature,
and of the members and committees of a
House of such Legislature, shall be such as
may from time to time be defined by that
Legislature by law, and until so defined, shall
be those of that House and of its members
and committees immediately before the
coming into force of section 26 of the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) act, 1978.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

It must be noted that although the Constitution
(Forty-fourth amendment) Act, 1978 omitted reference to the British House of Commons for the purpose of determining the powers and privileges of
Houses of Parliament in India, in the absence of
enactment of any law defining them, these privileges, in effect, remained the same as those of the
British House of Commons at the commencement
of the Constitution.

<h3>Panchayat
& Municipalities</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rural Local Bodies</i></strong></div>

The Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act,
1992 has added a new Part IX consisting of 16
Articles and the Eleventh Schedule to the
Constitution. The 73rd Amendment Act
envisages the Gram Sabha as the foundation of
the Panchayati Raj System to perform functions
and powers entrusted to it by the State
legislatures. The amendment provide for a three
tier Panchayati Raj System at the village,
intermediate and district levels. Small states
with population below twenty lakh have been
given the option not to constitute the Panchayats
at the intermediate level. The Act provides that
the Panchayat bodies will have an assured
duration of five years, with elections mandatory
after this period. However, one thing is to be
noted that under the Amendment Act the
establishment of Panchayats and the devolution
of necessary powers and authority on the
Panchayati Raj institutions are vested in the
State Governments. In view of this it may be
said that the success of the Panchayati Raj
institutions as a unit of democracy and thereby
ushering an all around development of rural
areas will much depend on the intention and 
support of the State Governments. Without
honest intention, these institutions would be
misused by rural rich and poor and illiterate
masses will remain a mute supporters as it is
happening in Parliamentary and State Assembly
elections in the Country.
<br>
<b>The salient features of the Seventy-Third
Constitutional Amendment Act may be
summarised as follows:</b>

<b>Gram Sabha:</b> Article 243A provides that the
Gram Sabha may exercise such powers and
perform such functions at the village level as the
legislature of a State may by law provide. The
73rd amendment thus envisages the Gram Sabha
as the foundation of Panchayati Raj System.
'Gram Sabha' means a body consisting of persons
registered in the electoral rolls relating to village
comprised within the area of Panchayat at the
village level.
<br>
<b>Constitution of Panchayats:</b> Article 243B
visualises a three-tier Panchayati Raj System. It
provides that in every State there shall be
constituted Panchayats at the village,
intermediate and district levels. Small states
having a population not exceeding twenty lakhs
have been given an option not to constitute the
Panchayats at the intermediate level.
<br>
<b>Composition of Panchayats:</b> Article 243C
provides that, subject to the provisions of this
part the legislature of a State may by law make
provisions with respect to the composition of
Panchayats. However, the ratio between the
population of the territorial area of a Panchayat
at any level and the number of seats in such
Panchayats to be filled by election shall, so far
as practicable, be the same throughout the
State.
<br>
All the seats in a Panchayat shall be filled by
persons chosen by direct election from territorial
constituencies in the Panchayat area. For this
purpose each Panchayat area shall be divided
into territorial constituencies in such manner
that the ratio between the population of each
constituencies and the number of seats allotted
to it, so far as practicable, be the same throughout
the Panchayat area.
The legislature of a State may by law provide
for representation of following persons in
Panchayats :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the Chairpersons (Chairman) of the
Panchayats at the village level, in the
Panchayats at the intermediate level or in
the case of a State not having Panchayats at
the intermediate level, in the Panchayats in
the district level;</li>
<li>the Chairpersons of the Panchayats at the
intermediate level, in the Panchayats at the
district level;</li>
<li>the members of the Lok Sabha and the
Legislative Assembly of the State
representing constituencies which comprise
wholly or partly a Panchayat area at the
level other than the village level, in such
Panchayats;</li>
<li>the members of the Rajya Sabha and
Legislative Council of the State where they
are registered as electors.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Chairperson of a Panchayat and other
members of Panchayat whether or not chosen
by direct election from territorial constituencies
in the Panchayat area shall have the right to
vote in the meetings of Panchayat.
The Chairperson of a Panchayat at the
village level shall be elected in such a manner
as the legislature of a State may by law, provide.
The Chairperson of a Panchayat at the
intermediate level or district level shall be elected
by, and amongst, the elected members thereof.


<b>Disqualifications for Membership:</b> A
person shall be disqualified for being chosen as,
and for being a member of Panchayats:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>if he is so disqualified by or under any law
for the time being in force for the purposes
of elections to the legislature of the State
concerned;</li>
<li>if he is so disqualified by or under any law
made by the legislature of the State.
But no person shall be qualified on the
ground that he is less than 25 years of age,
under clause (a), if he has attained the age of
21 years.</li>
    </ul>
</ol> 

If any question arises as to whether a member
of a Panchayat has become subject to any of the
qualifications mentioned in clause (1) the
question shall be referred for the decision of
such authority and in such manner as the
legislature of a State may, by law, provide.


<b>Reservation of Seats in Panchayats:</b> Article
243D provides that in every Panchayats seats
shall be reserved for the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes. The number of seats so
reserved shall be, as nearly as may be, in the
same proportion to the total number of seats to
be filled by direct election in that Panchayat as
the population of the SCs and STs in that
Panchayat area bears to the total population of
that area and such seats may be allotted by
rotation to different constituencies in a
Panchayat.
<br>
Out of total number of seats reserved under
clause (1) not less than 1/3 seats shall be
reserved from women belonging to the SCs and
STs. [Clause (2)] Out of total number of seats to
be filled by direct election in every Panchayat
not less than 1/3 (including the number of seats
reserved for SC's and ST's women) seats shall
be reserved for women. Such seats may be
allotted by rotation to different constituents in
a Panchayat. [Clause (3)]
The office of the Chairpersons in the
Panchayats at the village or any other level shall
be reserved for SCs, STs, and women in such
manner as the legislature of a State may, by law,
provide. But the number of offices of
Chairpersons reserved for the SCs and STs in
the Panchayats at each level in any State shall
be, as nearly as possible, in the same proportion
to the total number of such offices in the
Panchayats at each level in proportion of the
total population of the SCs and STs in the State.
However, not less than 1/3 of the total number
of the offices of Chairperson in the Panchayat
at each level shall be reserved for women. The
number of offices reserved under this clause
shall be allotted by rotation to different
Panchayats at each level.
The reservation of seats under clauses (1)
and (2) and the reservation of offices of
Chairperson (other than the reservation for
women) under clause (4) shall cease to have
effect on the expiration of the period specified
in Article 334. [Clause (5)]
<div>
<b>Reservation for Backward Classes :</b> The
legislature of a State is empowered under clause
(6) to make provision or reservation of seats in
any Panchayat or office of Chairpersons in the
Panchayats at any level in favour of backward
classes of citizens.
</div>
<b>Duration of Panchayats :</b> According to
Article 243E every Panchayat, unless sooner
dissolved under any law for the time being in
force, shall continue for five years from the date
appointed for its first meeting. No amendment
of any law in force shall have effect of causing
dissolution of a Panchayat at any level which
is functioning before such amendment till the
expiration of its normal period of five years.
An election to constitute a Panchayat must
be completed :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>before the expiry of its duration;</li>
        <li>before the expiration of a period of six
months from the date of its dissolution.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

But where the remainder of the period for
which the dissolved Panchayat would have
continued in less than six months, it shall not
be necessary to hold any election under this
clause for constituting the Panchayat for such
period.
<b>Powers, Authority and Responsibility of
Panchayats :</b> Article 243G, provides that subject
to the provisions of this Constitution the
legislature of a State may, by law, endow the
Panchayats with such powers and authority as
may be necessary to enable them to function as
an institution of self government. Such law may
contain provision for the devolution of powers
and responsibilities upon Panchayats subject to
such conditions as may be specified therein,
with respect to :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the preparation of plans for economic
development and social justice;</li>
<li>the implementation of schemes for social
development and social justice as may be
entrusted to them including those in relation
to the matters listed in the Eleventh Schedule.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The matters listed in the Eleventh Schedule
are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Agriculture, including agricultural extension.</li>

</ul>
</ol>

It is to be noted that Article 243G is subject
to the provisions of the Constitution. This means
that the normal distribution of powers under
Article 245 and 246 cannot be effected by the
State legislature while vesting with powers and
authorities upon the Panchayats.
<br>
<b>Powers to Impose Taxes and Funds of
Panchayats :</b> Article 243H empowers a State

tolls and fees levied and collected by the
State Government for such purposes and
subject to such conditions and limits;</li>
<li>provide for making such grants-in-aid to the
Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund for
the State; and</li>
<li>provide for constitution of such funds for
crediting all moneys received, by or on behalf
of the Panchayats and also for the
withdrawal of such money therefrom.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Finance Commission :</b> Article 243-I provides
for the establishment of a Finance Commission
for reviewing financial position of the
Panchayats. The Governor of a State shall within
one year from the commencement of the
Constitution (73rd Amendment) Act, 1992 and
thereafter at the expiration of every fifth year,

    <ul>
        <li>the principles which should govern :
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>the distribution between the State and the
Panchayats of the net proceeds of the
taxes, duties, tolls and fees leviable by the
State, which may be divided between
them under this Part and the allocation
between the Panchayats at all levels of
their respective shares of such proceeds;</li>
<li>the determination of the taxes, duties, tolls
and fees which may assigned to, or appropriated by, the Panchayats;</li>
<li>the grants-in-aid to the Panchayats from
the Consolidated Fund of the State;</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>the measures needed to improve the financial
position of the Panchayats;</li>
<li>any other matter referred to the Finance
Commission by the Governor in the interests
of sound finance of the Panchayats.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The commission shall determine its procedure
and shall have such powers in the performance
of its functions as the State legislature may, by
law, confer on it.

The Governor shall cause every
recommendation made by the Commission
together with an explanatory memorandum as
to the action taken thereon to be laid before the
legislature of the State.
“The Governor shall cause every
recommendation made by the Commission
together with an explanatory memorandum as
to the action taken thereon to be laid before the
legislature of the State
“The State Finance Commission under
Panchayatri Raj Law is designed to ensure
regional balance in the distribution of State and
Central Funds.”
<div>
<b>Audit of Accounts of Panchayats :</b> The
legislature of a State may, by law, make provision
with respect to the maintenance of accounts by
the Panchayats and the auditing of such
accounts.
</div>
<b>Elections to the Panchayats :</b> Under Article
243K the superintendence, direction and control
of the preparation of electoral rolls and conduct
of all elections to the Panchayats shall be vested
in a State Election Commission consisting of the
State Election Commissioner to be appointed by
the Governor. Subject to the provisions of any
law made by the State legislature, the conditions
of service and tenure of office of the State
Election Commissioner shall be such as the
Governor may by rule determine. The State
Election Commissioner shall not be removed
from his office except in like manner and on like
grounds as a Judge of a High Court. The
conditions of service of the State Election
Commissioner shall not be varied to his
disadvantage after his appointment.
The Governor of State shall, when so
requested by the State Election Commissioner,
make available to Commission such staff as may
be necessary for the discharge of its functions.
The State legislature may, subject to the
provisions of this Constitution, by law, make
provision with respect to all matters relating to
or in connection with elections to the Panchayats.
<br>
<b>Part not to apply to Certain Areas :</b> Article
243M provides that Part 9 shall not apply to the
following areas :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the scheduled areas referred to in clause
(1) and tribal areas referred to in clause (2)
of Article 244;</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Financial Powers of Panchayati Raj
Institutions</i></strong></div>

Article 243-G of the Constitution of India—
introduced by the 73rd Amendment—deals with
the question of powers, authority and
responsibilities of Panchayats. It reads thus :
“Subject to the provisions of the Constitution,
the legislature of the State may, by law, endow
the Panchayats with such powers and authority
as may be necessary to enable them to function
as institutions of self-government and such law
may contain provisions for the devolution of
powers and responsibilities upon Panchayats at
the appropriate level, subject to such conditions
as may be specified therein, with respect to—(a)
the preparation of plans for economic
development and social justice; and (b) the
implementation of such schemes for economic
development and social justice as may be
entrusted to them including those in relation to
the matters listed in the Eleventh Schedule.”
While Article 243-G of the Constitution
visualises Panchayats as institutions for selfgovernment, it subjects the extent of devolution
of powers and functions to the will of the State
Legislatures.
As per Article 243-H of the Constitution,
State Legislatures have been empowered to
enact laws;
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>to authorise a Panchayat to levy, collect and
appropriate some taxes, duties, tolls and
fees;</li>
<li>to assign to the Panchayat, some taxes,
duties, tolls levied and collected by the State
Government;</li>
<li>to provide for making grants-in-aid to the
Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of
the State; and</li>
<li>to provide for constitution of such funds for
Panchayats for crediting all money received
by or on behalf of Panchayats and also the
withdrawal of such money therefrom.</li>
    </ul>
</ol> 

Article 243-I of the Constitution provides for
constitution of a State Finance Commission
(SFC) to review the financial position of
Panchayats and to make recommendations to
the Governor regarding the principles governing
the major issues mentioned in Article 243-H.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Urban Local Bodies</i></strong></div>

The Narsimha Rao Government introduced
a Constitution Amendment Bill pertaining to
urban local bodies in the Lok Sabha on September
16, 1991. With a few modifications, it was
essentially based on the 65th Amendment Bill
brought by the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi
and which was defeated in the Rajya Sabha in
October 1989. The Bill was passed by both the
Houses in December 1992. It received the assent
of the President on April 20, 1993 and was
published in the gazette on the same day as the
Constitution 74th Amendment Act, 1992.
Part IX-A has been added to the constitution.
This amendment has added 18 new articles and
a new twelfth schedule relating to urban local
bodies in the constitution.
The objectives of 74th Constitution
Amendment Act include decentralization of
power and ensuring popular participation in
planning management and delivery of civil
services. It introduces some fundamental changes
