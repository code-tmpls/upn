<h3>Judiciary VS. Legislature</h3>

Conflict between legislature and the judiciary
has often given rise to anxiety and grave concern
to the governments at the Centre and the States.
The executive heaves a sigh of relief when the
conflict gets resolved or the matter is put in the
cold storage after initial heat over the powers each
of these wings of the States enjoy under the
Constitution subsidies. There are a number of
cases where friction between the two has arisen.
There has been a perennial conflict not only inndia
but also in England about the respective rights and
privileges of Members of Parliament and the
Judiciary.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Indian Scene</i></strong></div>

In India, under the written Constitution, the
three organs of the Government, viz. the
Legislature, judiciary and the executive, have to
function within their respective powers and none
of them can exceed its powers. Whether, any one
of these organs has exceeded its powers or not, is
a matter of judicial interpretation. In several
decisions of the Supreme Court, it has been held
that the Supreme Court is the ultimate interpreter
of the Constitution and its interpretation is binding
on all courts, tribunals and authorities in this
country. Under article 141 of the Constitution, the
law declared by the Supreme Court is binding on
all parties. So, if there is any doubt that any
particular organ of Government has exceeded its
powers, the interpretation ultimately rests with
the Supreme Court.
Even the powers granted by the Constitution
to the Members of Parliament and the Assembly
are subject to other provisions of the Constitution.
They cannot act arbitrarily; nor can they deprive
the citizens of their fundamental rights arbitrarily.
There is a provision in the Constitution for codifying
the laws relating to the privileges of legislatures
and if Parliament makes such a law that infringes
with Article 13 of the Constitution; validity of the
same can be tested before the Supreme Court in
the same manner as any other legislation. So, the
scheme of the Constitution does not contemplate
that Parliament or a State Legislature is not at all
liable to be questioned for any violation of law
since rule of law is the corner-stone of the
Constitution of India. Though Legislatures in
India have plenary powers they function within
limits prescribed by the material and relevant
provisions of the Constitution.
<div><b>Main areas of conflict</b></div>

Following are the Main areas of conflict
between the Legislature and the Judiciary:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Existence, extent and scope of Parliamentary
privileges and power of Legislatures to punish
for contempt,</li>
<li>Decisions given by the Presiding Officers of
Legislatures under the Anti-defection law;
and</li>
<li>Decision given by the Presiding Officers of
Legislatures in administration of their
Secretariats.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

With an aim to reduce the conflict between the
Legislature and Judiciary, it is recommended that
the Presiding Officers should not be made party
personally in a suit pertaining to the administrative
matters of their Secretariats. The suit, in turn,
could be filed against the concerned Legislature 
through the Secretary of the Legislature who
could represent the legislature in the Court and if
necessary, appear personally in the case. But, it is
NOT recommended to enlarge the scope of article
361 to provide the same protection to the Presiding
Officers as enjoyed by the President of India and
the Governors of States. Some critics opine that
there was no need to codify the privileges of the
Legislature. This argument is understandable as it
is based on the apprehension that it will give rise
to more judicial interference. On the other hand,
from the point of view of citizens, the codification
of privileges of Legislatures may be highly desirable,
a view-point which is strongly supported by the
press and the media. It is a matter of satisfaction
that there have not been too many cases where
the Legislature was called upon to exercise its
powers for punishing for the breach of privilege
and contempt of the House. But, the relations
between legislature and judiciary in the context of
privileges and immunities would continue to cause
some uneasiness till the time grammar and spirit
of democratic form of government became the
grain of Indian society.
Anyways, it is needless to say that the strength
of the democracy lies in the existence of harmonious
relations among different organs of the State, in
particular, Legislature and Judiciary. These relations
can be harmonized through informal mechanisms
and mutual understanding. After all, every detail
relating to the functioning of democracy cannot
be put in black and white.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE POWERS, PRIVILEGES AND
IMMUNITIES OF MEMBERS OF LEGISLATURES?</i></strong></div>

The relevant provision of the Constitution relating
to powers, privileges and immunities of the members of Parliament and State Legislatures is incorporated under Article 105 & Article 194 respectively.
These Articles provide that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Subject to the provisions of the Constitution
and to the rules and standing orders regulating the procedure of the Legislatures, there
shall be freedom of speech in the Legislature of the Union and of every State.</li>
<li>No member of any Legislature shall be liable to any proceedings in any court in respect of anything said or any vote given by
him in the Legislature or any committee
thereof, and no person shall be so liable in
respect of the publication by or under the
authority of a House of such a Legislature of
any report, paper, votes or proceedings.</li>
<li>In other respects, the powers, privileges and
immunities of a House of any Legislature,
and of the members and committees of a
House of such Legislature, shall be such as
may from time to time be defined by that
Legislature by law, and until so defined, shall
be those of that House and of its members
and committees immediately before the
coming into force of section 26 of the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) act, 1978.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

It must be noted that although the Constitution
(Forty-fourth amendment) Act, 1978 omitted reference to the British House of Commons for the purpose of determining the powers and privileges of
Houses of Parliament in India, in the absence of
enactment of any law defining them, these privileges, in effect, remained the same as those of the
British House of Commons at the commencement
of the Constitution.
