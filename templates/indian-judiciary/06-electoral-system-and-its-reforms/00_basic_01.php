<h3>Electoral System
and its Reforms</h3>

The more the elections are free and fair, the
stronger the allegiance the people will have
towards democratic institutions. Thus, the Constitution of India provides for an independent
Election Commission to safeguard the faith of
people towards democracy. Specific constitutional provisions regarding Elections are as
follows:
<br>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Article 324:</i></strong></div>

Superintendence, direction and control of
elections to be vested in an Election Commission-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls
for, and the conduct of, all elections to
Parliament and to the Legislature of every
State and of elections to the offices of
President and Vice-President held under
this Constitution shall be vested in a Commission (referred to in this Constitution as
the Election Commission).</li>
<li>The Election Commission shall consist of
the Chief Election Commissioner and such
number of other Election Commissioners,
if any, as the President may from time to
time fix and the appointment of the Chief
Election Commissioner and other Election
Commissioners shall, subject to the provisions of any law made in that behalf by
Parliament, be made by the President.</li>
<li>When any other Election Commissioner is
so appointed the Chief Election Commissioner shall act as the Chairman of the
Election Commission.</li>
<li>Before each general election to the House
of the People and to the Legislative Assembly of each State, and before the first
general election and thereafter before each
biennial election to the Legislative Council
of each State having such Council, the
President may also appoint after consultation with the Election Commission such
Regional Commissioners as he may consider necessary to assist the Election Commission in the performance of the functions conferred on the Commission by
clause (1).</li>
<li>Subject to the provisions of any law made
by Parliament, the conditions of service
and tenure of office of the Election Commissioners and the Regional Commissioners shall be such as the President may by
rule determine:</li>

except in like manner and on the like grounds
as a Judge of the Supreme Court and the
conditions of service of the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be varied to his disadvantage
after his appointment:
Provided further that any other Election
Commissioner or a Regional Commissioner shall
not be removed from office except on the recommendation of the Chief Election Commissioner.
<li>The President, or the Governor of a State,
shall, when so requested by the Election Commission, make available to the Election
Commission or to a Regional Commissioner

Election Commission by clause (1).</li>
</ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Article 325:</i></strong></div>

House of the Legislature of a State and no
person shall be ineligible for inclusion in any

electoral roll for any such constituency on
grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex or any
of them.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Article 326:</i></strong></div>

Elections to the House of the People and to
the Legislative Assemblies of States to be on the

is a citizen of India and who is not less than
[eighteen years] of age on such date as may be
fixed in that behalf by or under any law made
by the appropriate Legislature and is not otherwise disqualified under this Constitution or
any law made by the appropriate Legislature on
the ground of non-residence, unsoundness of
mind, crime or corrupt or illegal practice, shall
be entitled to be registered as a voter at any such
election.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Article 327:</i></strong></div>

Power of Parliament to make provision with
respect to elections to Legislatures.- Subject to
the provisions of this Constitution, Parliament

be provided for by or under any law made
by the appropriate Legislature.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Electoral Reforms: Suggestions</i></strong></div>

Electoral reforms and other measures have
become imperative to overcome the threat to
democracy and carry democratic process forward. To improve the drawbacks and loopholes in the electoral system, many reforms have
been proposed. Some of them are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Independent Election Machinery</i></strong></div>
        
The Election Commission should have its
own administrative machinery at the state level
and its powers should be considerably augmented. At present, the Election Commission
is completely at the mercy of the Central and
State governments. It cannot even maintain the
electoral rolls up-to-date without assistance from
the state government. In these circumstances,
the independence of the election system would
always be under constant threat from the vested
interests dominating the party in power which
in fact controls the administration. Unless, the
Commission is provided with an independent
cadre and enjoys the same degree of autonomy
as the judiciary, its impartiality will remain a
theoretical concept.</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Simultaneous Elections</i></strong></div>

To curb the election expenditure, it would
help much if elections are simultaneously held
for the Lok Sabha, State Assembly and also the
local bodies (through constitutional amendments
their term can be easily made uniform). This
would drastically reduce election expenditure
of all kinds and would incidentally promote
development of a healthy party system at all
levels of administrative structure.</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>State Funding</i></strong></div>

In addition to the simultaneous holding of
elections, some system of funding of electoral
campaigns is absolutely necessary. A simple
procedure can be adopted:
Candidates of a recognised political party
and independents, who have received more
than, say 25 per cent of the valid votes polled
in a particular constituency in a previous election, should be entitled to receive a fixed
contribution in two installments equal to threefourth of the limit imposed by the Election
Commission on the election expenditure. The
amounts should be given directly to qualified
candidates seeming re-election and not to the
parties. Bossism prevails in all parties, and, if
the funds are distributed through the parties,
blatant discrimination would be practised. The
accounts should be indicated by machinery set
up by the Election Commission. There should
be limit on leaflets and posters issued and
advertisements contributed by the candidates
and parties during the elections.</li>
<li>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Election Time Table</i></strong></div>

In order to help reduce the heavy expenses
incurred by the candidates in electioneering, the
scrutiny of nomination should be taken up on
the day after the last date for making nominations, the interval allowed after the scrutiny of
nominations for the withdrawal of candidatures
should be reduced to 2 days and the minimum
period prescribed for the election campaign
should be reduced to 15 days.</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Election Machines</i></strong></div>    

There is a need to use electronic machines in
the voting process. The only difference here is
the voter has to press a button instead of
marking a ballot paper. The use of electronic 
gadgets for election purpose will in the long run
add to the savings.</li>
<li>Speedy disposal of election disputes
Election petitions also take a long time to be
disposed of. Although, it is inquired by law that
the election petition should be disposed of within
6 months of its filing, yet seldom this is done.
The J.P committee, while agreeing that the
election petitions should be filed only in High
Courts also recommends that the cases should
be so distributed among a large number of
judges that they are expeditiously disposed of
(at least within the stipulated period of 6 months)</li>


<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Proportional Representation with List System</i></strong></div>    

The present majority system should be replaced by a system of proportional representation. Of all the system of representation, proportional representation will be best suited to
our conditions to ensure that legislative bodies,
i.e. the Lok Sabha and the state Assembly -
more correctly reflect the popular support, the
different political parties enjoy in a state or in
the country as a whole. The legislative bodies
will mirror the correlation of the political forces
and trends. Seats should be allotted in proportion to the valid polled votes of the different
political parties. Of the various form of the
proportional representation, the most democratic and feasible for our conditions will be list
system. The electorate votes for the party list as
a whole.</li>


<li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Caretaker Government at the Centre and
in the States</i></strong></div>    

In the case of Lok Sabha and Assembly
elections, the Central Government as well as the
State Governments should function only as
caretaker governments during a minimum period immediately preceding the election and it
should include some leaders of the opposition
parties.
</li>
<li>
    
<div class="subheading"><strong><i> Delay in Elections</i></strong></div>    
   
Many times there is an inordinate delay in
holding by-elections or elections to Assembly after
their dissolution. These create a lot of bitterness
and suspicion. Even though it is the discretion of
the Government to announce the election schedule, it will be disastrous to utilise such discretionary power for unfair and improper political gains.
A mandatory provision should, therefore, be made
to hold such elections within six months from the
day of vacancy or dissolution.</li>
<li>Election Expenditure
Expenses incurred by the candidates and the
party be taken into consideration while accounting for election expenditure. Having regard to the present costs, proper limits on
expenditure should be fixed in consultation
with the opposition parties. Expenditure incurred by some voluntary organisations should
also form part of the election expenses. All these
expenses must be required to be examined by
chartered accountants and any false entries
should be made rigorously punishable</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recommendations of Famous Committees</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tarakunde Committee (Joint Parliamentary Committee)</i></strong></div>

In August, 1974, Jaya Prakash Narayan
appointed a committee to study and report on
a scheme for election reform. The following
were the recommendations:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Election Commission should be appointed
by the President on the advice of a Committee consisting of the PM, the leader of the
opposition in the Lok Sabha and Chief Justice.</li>
<li>The Election Commission should be a threemember body.</li>
<li>The minimum age for voting should be 18
years.</li>
<li>The TV and Radio should be placed under the
control of autonomous statutory corporation.</li>
<li>The Committee recommended the formation
of Voters Council in as many constituencies
as possible which can help in free and fair
election.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Goswami Committee</i></strong></div>

In January 1990, the then Prime Minister
Vishwanath Pratap Singh convened a meeting of
political parties in Parliament and set up the
Dinesh Goswami Committee on electoral reforms
under the chairmanship of the Law Minister. The
Dinesh Goswami Committee completed its work
in five months in May 1990 and made farreaching recommendations encompassing the
Election Commission, delimitation and enrolment
of eligible candidates including that a person
should not be allowed to contest elections from
more than two constituencies of the same class.
Other important recommendations of the Committee are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On booth capturing, the committee felt that
even after the 1988 amendment of the Representation of the People's act the evil persisted and recommended a series of legislative measures to eradicate booth capturing,
rigging and intimidation. The recommended
steps include ordering of repoll or countermanding not only on the report of the
returning officer but even otherwise and
giving the Commission the power to appoint
investigation agencies, prosecuting agencies
and ask for the constitution of special courts.</li>
<li>The power of deciding the legal aspect of
disqualification should be taken away from,
the Speaker or Chairman and entrusted to
the President or Governor who will act
according to the Election Commission's recommendations. Nominated members of the
House should also incur disqualification, if
they joined any political party at any period
of time.</li>
<li>A person should not be allowed to contest
election from more than two constituencies. Age qualification for contesting elections to Legislative Assemblies and Lok
Sabha should be reduced to 21 years and
Legislative Councils and Council of States
to 25 years.</li>
<li>A person should not be allowed to contest
election from more than two constituencies. Age qualification for contesting elections to Legislative Assemblies and Lok
Sabha should be reduced to 21 years and
Legislative Councils and Council of States
to 25 years.</li>
<li>For discouraging non-serious candidates, the
security deposit in their cases should be
Rs.5,000 for Lok Sabha election and Rs.2,500
for Assembly elections. This will be forfeited
if they fail to secure one-fourth of the votes
instead of one sixth as at present. The
number of proposers to a nomination paper
filed by them should be ten, drawn from
different Assembly segments.</li>
<li>The committee has said that there should
be statutory backing for some of the important provisions of the model code of
conduct like use of official machinery and
personnel, including aircraft and vehicles, issue of advertisement matter at
the cost of the exchequer, use of official
media for partisan coverage of political
news, announcement or sanctioning of
financial grants in any form or making
payments out of discretionary funds and
laying of foundation stones for projects.</li>
<li>It called for a ban on transfer of officials and staff
connected with election work and giving the
commissions observers statutory powers.</li>
<li>The panel called for fixing of a six month
time limit for holding by-elections.</li>\
<li>It also said that a standing committee of
Parliament should be constituted to go into
all matter from time to time as electoral
reforms were a continuous process.</li>
<li>The committee said that it was satisfied that
the electronic voting machine was free from
any scope of manipulation of temporability
and should be used in all future general and
by-elections.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indrajit Gupta Committee</i></strong></div>

It was in June 1998 that the Indrajit Gupta
Committee was set up to go into the central
issue of election funding. Preceded by an allIndia party meet a month earlier in May 1998,
the Indrajit Gupta Committee finalised its report on December 30, 1998.
The committee headed by the late CPI stalwart stressed that the state funding of elections
was fully justified - constitutionally and legally.
It observed that such funding should be confined to parties recognised as national or state
parties by the Election Commission. To begin
with only a part of the financial burden of
political parties may be shifted to the state. A
greater burden could be progressively shifted to
the states so that ultimately all their legitimate
expenses become a charge on the state. The
committee suggested that state funding be in
kind not cash.
It desired the creation of a separate election 
fund for meeting the expenses on state funding 
of elections. To begin with the Central Government may contribute Rs 600 crore annually at
the rate of Rs 10 per elector for the total 
electorate of 60 crore in the country (which has 
since gone up to 68-70 crore). The state governments all taken together may contribute a 
matching amount proportionately or Rs 600 
crore annually according with the present financial arrangement between the Centre and
the states whereby all capital expenses on election items are shared by them on a 50:50 basis.
The Indrajit Gupta Committee said each
candidate of a recognised political party be
provided the following:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>specified quantity of petrol or diesel for
vehicles used for an election campaign,</li>
<li>specified quantity of paper for printing election literature and unofficial identity slips
for distribution to voters,</li>
<li>postal stamps of a specified amount,</li>
<li>five copies of electoral roll of the constituency,</li>
<li>a set of loudspeakers for every Assembly
constituency or for every Assembly segment
of a parliamentary constituency,</li>
<li>subject to a maximum of six such sets for the
entire parliamentary constituency,</li>
<li>one deposit-free telephone with specified
number of free calls for the main campaign
office in every Assembly constituency/segment (subject to a maximum of six such
telephones for the entire parliamentary constituency); and</li>
<li>minimum arrangements for his camps outside each polling station on the day of poll.
The committee noted that political parties
must submit their annual accounts regularly to
the income tax authorities showing details of
receipts and expenditure. No state funding should
be provided to any party or its candidates if
annual returns for the previous assessment year
have not been filed under the Income Tax Act.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
