<h3>Central and State "Public
Service Commission"</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Union Public Service Commission</i></strong></div>

The Union Public Service Commission
(UPSC) is a constitutional body in India authorized to conduct examinations for appointment
to the various Civil Services of India. The Indian
Constitution (Part XIV - Services under the
Union and the states - Article no. 315 to 323)
provides for a Public Service Commission for the
union and a Public Service Commission for each
state.
Indianization of the superior Civil Services
became one of the major demands of the political movement compelling the British Indian
Government to consider setting up of a Public
Service Commission for recruitment to its services in the territory. Thus, the first Public
Service Commission was set up on 1 October
1926 by the then British Indian Government in
response to the demands of Indian politicians
that the superior Civil Services be Indianized.
The functions of this Public Service Commission
were largely advisory and, because of this limitation, it failed to satisfy the demands of Indian
political parties associated with the struggle for
freedom. The British Indian government then
set up a Federal Public Service Commission and
provided for the formation of provincial level
Public Service Commission under the Government of India Act 1935.
The Constituent Assembly, after independence, saw the need for giving a secure and
autonomous status to Public Service Commission both at Federal and Provincial levels for
ensuring unbiased recruitment to Civil Services
as also for protection of service interests. With
the promulgation of the new Constitution for
independent India on 26th January, 1950, the
Federal Public Service Commission was accorded a constitutional status as an autonomous entity and given the title – Union Public
Service Commission.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Provisions</i></strong></div>

The Union Public Service Commission
(UPSC) is the central recruiting agency in India.
It is an independent constitutional body in the
sense that it is directly created by the Constitution of India. The Constitution contains elaborate provisions regarding the composition, appointment and removal of members, powers
and functions and independence of the UPSC.
Apart from UPSC, the Constitution also provides for a State Public Service Commission
(SPSC) for each state and a Joint State Public
Service Commission (JSPSC) for two or more
states. While the SPSC is created, like UPSC,
directly by the Constitution, a JSPSC can be
created by an act of Parliament on the request
of the legislature of the States concerned. The
UPSC can also serve the needs of a state on the
request of the state Governor and with the
approval of the President of India.
There shall be a Public Service Commission
for the Union and a Public Service Commission
for each State or a Joint Public Service Commission for a group of States if the Parliament
provides for the establishment of such a Joint
Public Service Commission in Pursuance of a
resolution to that effect being passed by the
State Legislatures concerned. The Union Public
Service Commission also may, with the approval of the President, agree to serve the needs
of a State, if so requested by the Governor of that
State [Art. 315].
The number of members of the Commission
and their conditions of service shall determined
(a) by the President in the case of the Union or
a Joint Commission, and (b) by the Governor of
the State in the case of a State Commission;
provided that the conditions of service of a
member of a Commission shall not be altered to
his disadvantage after his appointment.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Appointment and Term of office of Members</i></strong></div>

The appointment of the Chairman and
members of Commission shall be made-(a) in
the case of the Union or a Joint Commission, by
the President; and (b) in the case of a State
Commission, by the Governor of the State. Half
of the members of a Commission shall be persons who have held office under the Government of India or of a State for at least ten years
[Art. 316].
The term of service of a member of a Commission shall be six years from the date of his
entering upon office, or until he attains the age
of sixty five years in the case of Union Commission or of sixty two years in the case of a State
or a Joint Commission. But a member's office
may be terminated earlier, in any of the following ways:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>By resignation in writing addressed to-the
President in the case of the Union or a
Joint Commission, or the Governor in the
case of a State Commission.</li>
<li>By removal by the President—
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>If the member is adjudged insolvent; or
engages himself during his term in paid
employment outside the duties of his office; or is in the opinion of the President
infirm in mind or body;</li>
<li>On the ground of misbehaviour according
to the report of the Supreme Court which
shall hold an enquiry on this matter on a
reference being made by the President.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Thus, even in the case of a State Commission, it is only the President who can make a
reference to the Supreme Court and make an
order or removal in pursuance of the report of
the Supreme Court. The Governor has only the
power to pass an interim order of suspension
pending the final order of the President on
receipt of the report of the Supreme Court [Art.
317(1)—(2)].
If a member's term comes to an end while
a reference under. Art. 317(1) is pending in the
Supreme Court the reference does not become
infructuous and the court must answer it.
A member shall be deemed to be guilty of
misbehaviour—
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>if he is in any way concerned or interested
in any contract made on behalf of the
Government of India or of a State; or</li>
<li>if he participates in any way in the profit
of such contract or agreement or in any
benefit therefrom otherwise than as a
member and in common with other members of an incorporated company. [Art.317
(4)].</li>

    </ul>
</ol>
The Constitution seeks to maintain the independence of the Public Service Commission
from the Executive in several ways—

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Independence of the Commission</i></strong></div>

The Constitution seeks to maintain the independence of the Public Service Commission
from the Executive in several ways—
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Chairman or a member of a Commission can be removed from office only in the
manner and for the grounds specified in
the Constitution.</li>
<li>The condition of service of a member of the
Public Service Commission shall not be
varied to his disadvantage after his appointment [Proviso to Art. 318]</li>
<li>The expenses of the Commission are
charged on the Consolidated Fund of India or of the State (as the case may be)
[Art. 322].</li>
<li>Certain disabilities are imposed upon the
Chairman and members of the Commission with respect to future employment
under the Government [Art. 319].
Thus, on ceasing to hold office—
<ol><ul>
    <li>The Chairman of Union Public Service
Commission shall be ineligible for further
employment either under the Government
of India of Under the Government of a
State;</li>
<li>The Chairman of a State Public Service
Commission shall be eligible for appointment as the Chairman or any other member of the Union Public Service Commission or as the Chairman of any other State
Public Service Commission, but not for
any other employment either under the
Government of India or under the Government of a State;</li>
<li>A member other than the Chairman of the
Union Public Service Commission shall be
eligible for appointment as the Chairman
of the Union Public Service Commission or
as the Chairman of a State Public Service
Commission, but not for any other employment either under “the Government
of India or under the Government of a
State;</li>
<li>A member other than the Chairman of a
State Public Service Commission shall be
eligible for appointment as the Chairman
or any other member of the Union Public
Service Commission or a the Chairman of
that or any other State Public Service
Commission, but not for any other employment either under the Government of
India or under the Government of a State.</li>
</ul></ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol> 


In short, the bar against employment under
the Government is absolute in the case of the
Chairman of the Union Public Service Commission; while in the case of the Chairman of a
State Public Service Commission or of the other
members of the Union or State Commission,
there is scope of employment in a higher post
within the Public Service Commission but not
outside.
The Public Service Commission are advisory
bodies. It is open to the government to accept
the recommendation or depart from it.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functions of Public Commission</i></strong></div>

The following are the duties for Union and
the State Public Service Commission—
To conduct examination for appointment to
the service of the Union and the service of the
State respectively.
To advise on any matter so referred to them
and on any other matter which the President or,
as the case may be, the Government of a State
may refer to the appropriate Commission [Art.
320].
To exercise such additional functions as
maybe provided for by an act of Parliament or
of the Legislature of a State—as respects the
service of the Union or the State and also as
respect the service of any local authority or
other body corporate constituted by law or of
any public institution [Art 321].
To present annually to the President or the
Governor, a report as to the work done by the
Union or the State Commission, as the case may
be [Art. 323].
It shall be the duty of the Union Public
Service Commission, if requested by any two or
more States so to do, to assist those State in
framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment for any services for which candidates
possessing special qualification are required [Art.
320 (2)].
The Public Service Commission for the Union,
if requested so to do by the Governor of a State,
may, with the approval of the President, agree
to serve all or any of the needs of the State.
The additional functions relating to the Services of the Union can be conferred on UPSC
by the Parliament. It can also place the personnel system of any local authority, corporate
body or public institution within the jurisdiction
of the UPSC. Hence the jurisdiction of UPSC
can be extended by an act made by the Parliament.
The rules and regulations made and orders
issued by the Union executive can entrust certain functions to the UPSC. This is done without
any reference being made to the Parliament.
The UPSC also performs certain functions
on the basis of the conventions. For instance, it
has been conducting, since 1948, written examinations for the selection of armed 
forces. It has also been selecting scientists and technicians
who are deputed to various fields.
To sum up, UPSC derives its functions from
four sources namely, the Constitution, Acts of
Parliament, executive rules and orders, and
conventions. These functions of UPSC can be
broadly classified into three categories, that is,
executive, regulatory and quasi-judicial.
The Union Public Service Commission or the
State Public Service Commission, as the case
may be, shall be consulted—
<ol>
    <u>
        <li>on all matters relating to methods of recruitment to civil services and for civil
posts,</li>
<li>on the principles to be followed in making
appointments to civil services and posts
and in making promotions and transfers
from one service to another and on the
suitability of candidates for such appointment, promotions or transfers;</li>
<li>on all disciplinary matters affecting a person serving under the Government of India or the Government of a State in a civil
capacity, including memorials or petitions
relating to such matters;</li>
<li>on any claim by or in respect of a person
who is serving or has served under the
Government of India or the Government
of a State or under the Crown in India or
under the Government of an India State,
in a civil capacity, that any costs incurred
by him in defending legal proceedings
instituted against him in respect of acts
done or purporting to be done in the
execution of his duty should be paid out
of the Consolidated fund of India, or, as
the case may be, out of the Consolidated
Fund of the State;</li>
<li>on any claim for the award of a person in
respect of injuries sustained by a person
while serving under the Government of
India or the Government of a State or
under the Crown in India or under the
amount of any such award [Art.320 (3)].
But—
<ol>
    <ul>
    <li>The President or the Governor, as the case
may be, as respects the service and posts
in connection with the affairs of the Union
or of a Sate, may specify the matters in
which either generally, or in any particular of cases, or in any particular circumstances, it shall not be necessary for a
Public Service Commission to be consulted.
But all such regulations must be laid before
the appropriate Legislature and be subject
to such modifications as may be made by
the Legislature.</li>
<li> It has been held by the Supreme Court that
the obligation of the Government to consult the Public Service Commission in any
of the matters specified above does not
confer any right upon any individual who
may be affected by any act of the Government done without consulting the appropriate Commission as required by the
Constitution. The reason assigned by the
Court is that the consultation prescribed
by the Constitution is to afford proper
assistance to the Government, in the matter of assessing the guilt of a delinquent
officer, the merits of a claim for reimbursement of legal expenses and the like; and
that the function of the Commission being
purely advisory, if the Government fails to
consult the Commission with respect to
any of the specified matters, the resulting
act of the Commission is not invalidated
by reason of such omission and no individual who is affected by such act can seek
redress in a Court of law against the
Government for such irregularity or omission.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Report of Public Service Commissions</i></strong></div>

As stated already, it shall be the duty of the
Union Commission to present annually to the
President a report as to the work done by the
Commission and on receipt of such report the
President shall cause a copy thereof together
with a memorandum explaining, as respect the
cases, if any, where the advice of the Commission was not accepted, the reason for such nonacceptance, to be laid before each House of
Parliament [Art. 323 (1)]. A State Public Service
Commission has a similar duty to submit an
annual report to the Governor and the latter has
a duty to lay a copy of such report before the
State Legislature with a memorandum explaining the case, if any, where the advice of the
Commission was not accepted by the Government [Art. 323 (2)].


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>How far Commission's advice is binding
on the Government</i></strong></div>

As stated earlier, the function of the Public
Service Commission is only advisory and the
Constitution has no provision to make it obligatory upon the Government to act upon the
advice of the Commission in any case. The
reason is that, under the Parliamentary system
of Government, it is the Cabinet which is responsible for the proper administration of the
country and its responsibility is to Parliament.
They cannot, therefore, abjure this ultimate
responsibility by binding themselves by the
opinion of any other body of persons. On the
other hand, in matters relating to the recruitment to the Service and the like, it would be
profitable for the Ministers to take the advice of
a body of experts.
Notwithstanding the above safeguard, there
are criticisms from certain quarters that patronage is still exercised by the Government by
resorting to some devices—
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>One of these is the system of making ad
hoc appointments for a temporary period
without consulting the Public Service Commission, and then approaching the Commission to approve of the appointment at
a time when the person appointed has
already been in service for some time and
the recommendations of his superiors are
available to him, in addition to the experience already gained by him in the work,
which puts him at an advantage over the
new candidates. The Supreme Court has
been deprecating this practice of making
ad hoc appointment. The Supreme Court
did not allow the services of the employees
appointed de hors the rules, although
officiating for a long period of 14 years;
that of the ad hoc appointment by bypassing the process of recruitment through
open competition and a temporary appointee on monthly basis during the period of strike, to be regularized.</li>
<li>Sometimes the rules laying down the qualifications for the office to which such appointment has been made are changed
retrospectively to fit in the appointee.</li>
<li>Another complaint is that sometimes the
Reports are presented before Parliament
(or State Legislature as the case may be)
long after the year under review. This,
however, does not appear to be permissible under the Constitution. So far as the
duty of the Commission to report to the
President or the Governor is concerned,
the Constitution says that it must be done
'annually'. Hence, his obligation cannot be
postponed for more than a few months
from the end of the period under Report.
The duty of the President or the Governor
is to present the Report to Parliament or
the State Legislature “on receipt of such
Report”. Though no specific time-limit is
imposed, it is clear that it must be done as
soon as possible after the receipt of the
annual Report and it cannot be construed
that the obligation is discharged by presenting the Report two or three years after
the receipt or by presenting the Reports
for two or three years in a lump. The
presentation before the Legislature must
also be annual affair, and if the President
or the Governor makes delay, it should be
the concern of the appropriate Legislature
to demand an explanation for such delay
presentation, apart from anything else. If
the Legislature slumbers, the entire machinery of Parliamentary government will
succumb, not to speak of any particular
object of scrutiny by the Legislature.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Matters on which UPSC is not consulted</i></strong></div>

It is not necessary to consult the Commission
with regard to the representation given to scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the civil
service. Provisions for this are made in Article
335, which mentions that “the claims of the
members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes shall be taken into consideration,
consistently with the maintenance of efficiency
of administration, in the making of appointments to services and posts in connection with
the affairs of the Union or a State. “The UPSC
is not called upon of the Act of 1935, which kept
communal representation outside the purview
of the Federal Public Service Commission.
Besides, there are certain other matters on
which the UPSC is not consulted. They are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Chairmanship or membership of tribunals
or commission;</li>
<li>Post of the highest diplomatic nature, and</li>
<li>Appointments to a bulk of Class III and
Class IV employees, who constitute about
98 percent of the total number of the
Central government employees.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Further, it is not necessary for the government to consult the Commission in regard to the
selection for temporary or officiating appointment to a post, if the person appointed is not
likely to hold the post for more than a year, and
if it is necessary in public interest to make the
appointment immediately and a reference to the
Commission in this respect is likely to cause
undue delay. Though the Commission is to be
informed of the action taken by an executive
agency in this respect, there are instances where
this facilitating provision has been misused,
thus violating the spirit of the law.
