<h3>Emergency
Provisions</h3>



The term 'Emergency' may be defined as "a
difficult situation arising suddenly and demanding immediate action by public authorities under powers specially granted to them by the
Constitution or otherwise to meet such exigencies".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Types of Emergency</i></strong></div>

Broadly, the Emergency provisions of the
Constitution envisage two kinds of emergencies,
viz.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>a National Emergency under article 352 due
to threat of war, external aggression or
armed rebellion and</li>
<li>Financial Emergency under article 360.
The third kind of situation, that is, the one
under article 356 arising from a failure of the
constitutional machinery in any particular State
and necessitating President's rule.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Emergency (Art.352)</i></strong></div>

Article 352 provides that if the President,
after receiving a written communication of a
Cabinet decision, is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or
any part thereof is threatened by war, external
aggression or armed rebellion, he may issue a
Proclamation of Emergency for the whole of
India or part thereof. Every Proclamation of
Emergency is required to be laid before each
House of Parliament, and is to cease to operate
at the expiration of one month from the date of
its issue by the President unless it has in the
meantime been approved by resolutions of both
the House. However, once approved by Parliament, the Proclamation may continue in
operation for six months at a time unless revoked by the President earlier by a subsequent
Proclamation. Resolutions approving the
Proclamation of Emergency or its continuance
have to be passed by either House of Parliament
by a majority of the total membership and not
less than two third of those present and voting.
Also, if the Lok Sabha passes a resolution
disapproving the Proclamation or its continuance, it shall be revoked forthwith. If notice of
a resolution signed by not less than one-tenth of
the total membership is given to the President
Speaker, a special sitting of the House shall be
held within 14 days to consider it. . During the
periods of Emergency, extraordinary powers
may be assumed by the Union Government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Executive powers of the Union during
Emergency</i></strong></div>

Article 353, read with article 365 provides
that once Emergency is proclaimed, the executive power of the union extend to giving of
directions to any State in regard to the exercise
of the executive power of the State and failure
to comply with the directions would constitute
enough justification for imposition of President's
rule under Article 356. During the operation of
Emergency, the legislative power of Parliament
also extends to conferring powers and imposing
duties by law on Union authorities in matters
not otherwise included in the Union List. Under
article 354, the application of provisions relating
to distribution of revenues articles (268 to 279)
may be suitably modified during the period of
the operation of Emergency. Article 358, 
provides for the suspension of the provisions of
article 19 during emergencies while article 359
authorises the President to suspend by ordering
the enforcement of all the Fundamental Rights
guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution except
the rights of protection in respect of conviction
for offences and protection of life and liberty
in articles 20 and 21.
The effect of the exercise of powers under
articles 358 and 359 is that not only the
legislature but also the executive can interfere
with the Fundamental Rights of individuals
except those under articles 20 and 21. Any law
passed under articles 358 and 359 in order to
be valid must contain a recital to the effect that
it is in relation to the Proclamation of Emergency in operation. Also, all such laws shall
cease to have effect to the extent of incompetency under the Fundamental Rights as soon as
the Emergency ceases or the Presidential order
ceases to have effect.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Proclamation of President's
Rule (Art. 356)</i></strong></div>

It is the constitutional duty of the Union to
protect its States against external aggression and
internal disturbance and to ensure that the
Government of every State is carried on in
accordance with the Constitution (Article 355).
If on receipt of a Report from the Governor or
otherwise, the President is satisfied that the
Government of the State cannot be carried on in
accordance with the Constitution or that the
constitution taking over any of the functions and
powers of the State Government including those
of the Governor and other State authorities. The
satisfaction of the President, of course, means the
satisfaction of the Union Government and
President's rule is actually rule by the Union
Government. If any State fails to comply with
directions issued by the Union under article 256,
257 or 353, the President may hold that there has
been a failure of constitutional machinery in that
State and may take over the State Government
under article 356.
Every Proclamation under Article 356 must
cease to operate at the expiry of two months
unless approved by resolutions of the two Houses
of the Prliament. After Parliament's approval
also, a Proclamation may continue for not more
than six months at a time and not for more than
a total of three years (except Punjab)


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>How the President's Rule affects State
Legislatures?</i></strong></div>

The powers of the State Legislature may
under the Proclamation become exercisable by
or on the authority of Parliament. The State
Assembly may be dissolved or kept under suspended animation. The president may take all
other steps that may be necessary including
suspension of the operation of any constitutional provisions relating to any body or authority in the State except the High Courts. During
the operation of President's rule under article
356, Parliament may confer the legislative
power of the State on the President and authorise
him to delegate these powers to other President
and other authorities (Article 357)


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Financial Emergency (Art. 360)</i></strong></div>

The President is authorised by article 360 of
the Constitution to declare by a Proclamation,
Financial Emergency, if he is satisfied that the
financial stability or credit of India or of any
part of its territory is threatened. Such a
Proclamation may be revoked or varied by a
subsequent Proclamation. It has to be laid
before both Houses of Parliament and ceases to
operate at the expiration of two months unless
meanwhile approved by resolutions of the two
House. Once approved by Parliament, unlike
Proclamation under article 352, it may continue
indefinitely until revoked or varied.
During the operation of Financial Emergency, the executive authority of the Union
extends to the giving of directions to any State
to observe certain specified canons of financial propriety and such other directions that
the President may find necessary or adequate.
These directions may include reduction of 
salaries and allowances of all those serving a
State and reserving for the President's consideration all money Bills and other Bills under
article 207 after these are passed by State
legislatures. The President may also direct
reduction in salaries and allowances of all
those serving in connection with the affairs of
the Union including judges of the Supreme
Court and the High Courts.
