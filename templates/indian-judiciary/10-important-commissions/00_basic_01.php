        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>National commission for Scheduled
Castes</i></strong></div>
        
The National Commission for Scheduled
Castes, a Constitutional body monitors the safeguards provided for Scheduled Castes and also
reviews issues concerning their welfare.
The SCs constitute 16.23% of India's population spread all over the country, with 80% of
them living in the rural areas. They constitute
more than a fifth of the population of UP,
Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and West Bengal.
Punjab has the highest proportion of SCs to the
State population. More than half of the SC
population is concentrated in the five States of
Uttar Pradesh (35.1 million), West Bengal (18.4
million), Tamil Nadu (11.8 million), Andhra
Pradesh (12.3 million) and Bihar (13.0 million).
Due to their social disability and economic
backwardness, they were grossly handicapped
in getting reasonable share in elected offices,
Government jobs and educational institutions
and, therefore, it was considered necessary to
follow a policy of reservations in their favour to
ensure their equitable participation in governance.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functions and duties of the commission are:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li> To investigate and monitor all matters relating

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Commission on Scheduled
Tribes</i></strong></div>
        
The National Commission for Scheduled
Tribes was first formed by the Government of
India in 1978 as a Non-statutory Multi-Member
Commission. Initially, the Commission was set
up through a resolution for both the Schedule
Castes and Schedule Tribes. In the year 1987,
the Government of India re-structured the duties of the Commission by authorizing it to
advice on the Broad Policy Issues and Levels of
Development of SCs and STs. The National
Commission for Scheduled Tribes (NCST) was
established by amending Article 338 and inserting a new Article 338A in the Constitution
through the Constitution (89th Amendment)
Act, 2003. By this amendment, the erstwhile
National Commission for Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes was replaced by two separate
Commissions namely- (i) the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), and (ii) the
National Commission for Scheduled Tribes
(NCST) in 2004.
Scheduled Tribes live in contiguous areas
unlike other communities. It is, therefore, much
simpler to have an area-approach for development activities and also regulatory provisions to
protect their interests. In order to protect the
interests of Scheduled Tribes with regard to
land alienation and other social factors, provisions of “Fifth Schedule” and "Sixth Schedule"
have been enshrined in the Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functions of the Commission are:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To investigate and monitor all the matters
relating to the safeguards provided for the
SCs and STs under the Constitution of India
or under any other law and to evaluate the
working of such scapegoats.</li>
<li>To enquire into specific complaints with
respect to the deprivation of the rights and
the safeguards of the SCs and the STs.</li>
<li>To participate and advise on the planning
process of socio-economic development of
the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled
Tribes and to evaluate the progress of their
development under the Union and any State.</li>
<li>To present to the President, annually and at
such other times as the Commission may
deem fit, reports upon the working of those
safeguards;</li>
<li>To make in such reports or recommendations
as to the measures that should be taken by
the Union or any State for the effective
implementation of those the protection,
welfare and socio-economic development of
the Schedule Castes and the Schedule Tribes
as the President may by lured specify.</li>

The term Scheduled Tribes is defined in the
Constitution of India under Article 366(25) as
such tribes or tribal communities or parts of
groups within such tribes or tribal communities
as are deemed under Article 342 to be Scheduled Tribes for the purposes of this Constitution.
According to the Article 342(1), the President may, with respect to any State or Union
Territory, and where it is State, after consultation with the Governor thereof, notifies tribes or
tribal communities or parts thereof as Scheduled Tribes. This confers on the tribe or part of
it a Constitutional status invoking the safeguards provided for in the Constitution, to these
communities in their respective States/UTs.

Thus only those communities who have
been declared as such by the President through
an initial public notification will be considered
as Scheduled Tribes. Parliament may, by law,
include in or exclude from the list of Scheduled
Tribes, any tribe or tribal community or parts of
thereof. The list of Scheduled Tribes is Statespecific. In other words, a community declared
as Scheduled Tribe in one State need not be so
in another State.
The Commission presents an annual report
to the President. The President places all the
reports before the Parliament along with memorandum explaining the action taken on the
recommendations made by the Commission.
The memorandum also contains the reasons for
the non acceptance of any recommendation.

In keeping with its mandate, the Commission initiated various steps to improve the status
of women and worked for their economic empowerment during the year under report. The
Commission completed its visits to all the States/
UTs except Lakshdweep and prepared Gender
Profiles to assess the status of women and their
empowerment. It received a large number of
complaints and acted suo-moto in several cases
to provide speedy justice.
It took up the issue of child marriage, sponsored legal awareness programmes, Parivarik
Mahila Lok Adalats and reviewed laws such as
Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, PNDT Act 1994,
Indian Penal Code 1860 and the National Commission for Women Act, 1990 to make them
more stringent and effective. It organized
workshops/consultations, constituted expert
committees on economic empowerment of
women, conducted workshops/seminars for
gender awareness and took up publicity campaign against female foeticide, violence against
women, etc. in order to generate awareness in
the society against these social evils.
    </ul>
 </ol>



</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NCW has adopted a Multi-Pronged strategy to
tackle the problem:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Generation of legal awareness among

Further NCW has launched
Women’s Rights campaign along with NGOs for
the upliftment of dalit women. Dalit women are
positioned at the bottom of India’s caste, class
and gender hierarchies. As a result, many Dalit
women face exploitation both in and out of the
home, often resulting in sexual assault and
other forms of violence. Thus Women’s Rights
Campaign has been launched to create awareness among the women rights.
<br>
<b>The objectives of the Women’s Rights campaign
include:</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To empower women by generating
awareness of their rights so they can seek
justice and dignity within their families and
communities.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


National Commission for Women regularly
brings out a monthly newsletter Rashtra
Mahila in Hindi and English to create awareness about the women rights in the society.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Information Commission</i></strong></div>

The Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005,
which came into force on 12 October 2005,
marked a new and higher level of evolution of
India's parliamentary democracy.
The Supreme Court has, in various judgements, held that the right to information is a
part of the fundamental right to freedom of
speech and expression under Article 19 (1) of
the Constitution, since the right cannot be
properly exercised if the people did not have the
right to information.
The clearest enunciation of the fundamental
right to information was seen in the Supreme
Court ruling in the State of U.P vs. Raj Narain
in which Justice K.K. Mathew said:
“The people of this country have a right to
know every public act, everything that is done
in a public way, by their public functionaries.
They are entitled to know the particulars of
every public transaction in all its bearing. The
right to know, which is derived from the concept of freedom of speech, though not absolute,
is a factor which should make one wary, when
secrecy is claimed for transactions which can,
at any rate, have no repercussion on public
security… “
Thus the Right to Information (RTI) Act,
2005 is designed to set up a practical regime for
citizens to access information available with
public authorities, in order to promote transparency and accountability in their working. This
Act provides for the constitution of the Central
Information Commission (CIC) to be responsible for the implementation of the Act.
Central Information Commission was constituted by the Central Government through a
Gazette Notification in October 2005. The
Commission includes 1 Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) and not more than 10 Information Commissioners (IC) who are appointed by
the President of India. Oath of Office is administered by the President of India according to the
form set out in the First Schedule.
CIC defines “information” as any material
in any form including records, documents,
memos, e-mails, opinions, advices, press releases, circulars, orders, logbooks, contracts,
reports, papers, samples, models, data material
held in any electronic form and information
relating to any private body which can be
accessed by a public authority under any other
law for the time being in force.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Powers and Functions of the Central Information
Commission</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The CIC is empowered to receive and inquire
into complaints from any person relating to
access to information under the control of
public authorities and to decide appeals
against the decisions of designated appellate
officers.</li>
<li>The Commission shall impose penalties on
erring Central Public Information Officers
and recommend disciplinary action against
those who have, without any reasonable
cause, denied access to information under
the provisions of the Act.</li>
<li>The quantum of penalty liable to be imposed
is Rs. 250 each day till the application is
received or information is furnished subject
to the total amount not exceeding Rs. 25,000.</li>
<li>The decision of the Commission on an appeal
is binding and is not subject to further
appeal in a court of law.</li>
<li>The Commission may make recommendations
to public authorities not conforming to the
provisions or the spirit of the Act, specifying

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Vigilance Commission</i></strong></div>

The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is
them agancy for preventing corruption in the
Central government. It was established in 1964
by an executive resolution of the Central government. Its establishment was recommended
by the Santhanam Committee on Prevention of
Corruption (1962-64).
Thus, originally the CVC was neither a
constitutional body nor a statutory body. Recently, in September 2003, the Parliament enacted a law conferring statutory status on the
CVC.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Composition</i></strong></div>

The CVC is a multi-member body consisting
of a Central Vigilance Commissioner (chairperson) and not more than two vigilance commissioner. They are appointed by the president by

office for a term of four years or until they attain
the age of sixty five years, whichever is earlier.
After their tenure, they are not eligible for

        <li>If he has been convicted of an offence which
(in the opinion of the Central government )
involves a moral turpitdue; or</li>
<li>If he engages, during his term of office, in
any paid employment outside the duties
of his office; or</li>
<li>If he is (in the opinion of the president), unfit
to continue in office by reason of
infirmity of mind or body; or</li>
<li>If he has acquired such financial or other
interset as is likely to affect prejudicially
his official functions.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In addition to these, the president can also
remove the Central Vigilance Commissioner or
any vigilance commissioner on the ground of
proved misbehaviour or incapacity, however, in
these cases, the president has to refer the matter
to the Supreme Court for an enquiry. If the
Supreme Court, after the enquiry, upholds the
cause of removal and advises so, then the
president can remove him. He is deemed to be
guilty of misbehaviour, if he (a) is concerned or
interested in any contract or agreement made
by the Central government, or (b) participates
in any way in the profit of such contract or
agreement or in any benefit or emolument
arising thereform otherwise than as a member
and in common with the other members or an
incorporated company.
The salary, allowances and other conditions
of services of the Central Vigilance Commissioner are similar to those of the Chairman of
UPSC and that of the vigilance commissioner
are similar to those of a member of UPSC. But
they cannot be varied to his disadvantage after
his appointment.
