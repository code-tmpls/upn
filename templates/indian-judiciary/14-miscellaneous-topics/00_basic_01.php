<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Separation of Powers</i></strong></div>
<b>Meaning</b>
<br>
The doctrine of separation of powers, ascribed to a Frenchman, Montesquieu has come
to mean an organic separation or separation of
government powers, namely, the legislative, the
executive, and the judicial powers. Any two of
these powers should not fall in the same hands.
They should not assume or combine functions
essentially belonging to each other. This is necessary to ward off any kind of tyrannical government. Thus, doctrine of separation of powers
stated in its rigid form means that each of the
branches of government, namely, executive or
administrative, legislative and judicial should be
confined exclusively to a separate department
or organ of government. There should be no
overlapping either of functions or of persons.
A distinction may be necessary between
essential and incidental powers of an organ of
government. Government is a living thing. Its
life is dependent upon cooperation of its organs,
which are interdependent. An organ may exercise some of the incidental powers of another
organ. However, no organ of government is
supreme. Each organ is limited to the exercise
of the powers confided to it under the law of
its creation, viz., the Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>'Separation' in USA</i></strong></div>

The Constitution of the United States is
usually quoted as the leading example of a
constitution embodying the doctrine of separation of powers. While Constitution of the U.S.A.
does not expressly provide for a separation of
power, the doctrine has been incorporated into
the Constitution by the provisions that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>All legislative powers shall be vested in a
Congress</li>
<li>All executive power shall be vested in President</li>
<li>All judicial power shall be vested in one
Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts
as Congress may from time to time ordain
and establish.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>'Separation' in India</i></strong></div>
Under the Indian constitution only executive power is 'vested' in the President while
provisions are simply made for a Parliament
and judiciary without expressly vesting the
legislative and judicial powers in any person or
body. Moreover, India has the same system of
parliamentary executive as in England and the
Council of Ministers consisting as it does of the
members of legislature is, like the British Cabinet, a hyphen which joins a buckle which
fastens the legislative part of the State to the
executive part. Even, though the Constitution of
India does not accept strict separation of powers it provides for an independent judiciary
with extensive jurisdiction over the acts of the
legislature and the executive.
The Cabinet, the Supreme Court of India has
said, is a hyphen which joins, or a buckle which
fastens, the Legislative part of the State to its
executive part. The Constitution in article 50,
however, specifically ordains separation of the
Judiciary from the Executive. The vitality and
importance of the doctrine of separation of
powers lies not in any rigid separation of functions, but in a working synthesis with the guarantee of judicial independence.
Accordingly, the Indian Constitution has
not recognised the doctrine of separation of
powers in its absolute form but the functions of
the different parts or branches of government
have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can very well be said that our Constitution does not contemplate assumption by
one organ or part of the State, of functions, that
essentially belong to another. The executive
indeed can exercise the powers of departmental
or subordinate legislation when such powers
are delegated to it by the legislature. It can also,
when so empowered, exercise judicial functions
in a limited way.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

Though the Constitution of India does not
formally recognize the doctrine of separation of
powers in its absolute rigidity, framers have
meticulously differentiated functioned of various
organs of the government. Each organ has to
function within its own sphere demarcated under
the Constitution. The principle of "checks and
balances" obtaining in our democracy necessitated this. The doctrine of separation of powers
has been held by the Supreme Court of India as
one of the basic features of the Constitution,
which cannot be impaired even by amending it
(vide Kesavananda v. State of Kerala, 1973)

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Anti-defection Law</i></strong></div>

The Constitution (52nd Amendment) Act,
1985, amended Art. 101,102,190, and 191 of the
Constitution regarding vacation of seats and
disqualification from membership of Parliament
and the State Legislatures, and added a new
Schedule (Tenth Schedule) to the Constitution
setting out certain provisions as to disqualification on grounds of 
defection. The Tenth Schedule inter alia provides that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>An elected member of Parliament or a
State Legislatures, who has been elected as
a candidate set up by a political party, and
a nominated member of Parliament or a
State Legislature who is a member of a
political party at the time he takes his seat
would be disqualified on the ground of
defection if he voluntarily reliiquishes his
membership of such political party or
votes or abstains from voting in the House
contrary to any direction of such party;</li>
<li>An independent member of Parliament or
a State Legislature will be disqualified if he
joins any political party after his election;</li>
<li>No disqualification would be incurred
where a member claims that he belongs to
a group representing a faction arising
from a split in a party or merger of a party
in another, provided that in the event of
a split the group consists of not less than
one-third of the members of the legislature
party and in case of a merger of not less
than two-third of the members of the
legislature party and in case of a merger
of not less than two-thirds of the members
of the legislature party concerned;</li>
<li>No disqualification is incurred by a person
who has been elected to the office to the
Speaker or the Deputy Speaker of the
House of the People or of the Legislative
Assembly of a State or to the office of the
Deputy Chairman of the Council of States
or the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman of
the Legislative Council of a State; if he
severe his connection with his political
party;</li>
<li>The question as to whether a member of a
House of Parliament or State Legislature
has become subject to disqualification will
be determined by the Chairman or the
Speaker of the respective House, where the
question is with reference to the Chairman
or the Speaker himself, it will be decided by
a member of the concerned House elected
by it on that behalf;</li>
<li>The Chairman or the Speaker of a House
has been empowered to make rules for
giving effect to the provisions of the Schedule. The rules are required to be laid before
the House and are subject to modifications/disapproval by the House;</li>
<li>All proceedings in relation to any question
as to disqualification of a member of a
House under the Schedule will be deemed
to be proceedings in Parliament within the
meaning of Art. 122 or, as the case may be,
proceedings in the Legislature of a State
within the meaning of Article 212; and</li>
<li>Notwithstanding anything in the Constitution, no Court will have any jurisdiction in
respect of any matter connected with the
disqualification of a member of a House.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Paragraph 7 of the Tenth Schedule which
bars the jurisdiction of the courts was held ultra
vires of the Constitution by the High Court of
Punjab and Harayana, and an appeal against
this order was preferred by the government in
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court (Kohoto
Holloian v. Zacchulliu & Others, 1991) found
that there were legal infirmities in the passage
of the Anti-defection law inasmuch as the
Constitution Amendment Bill had not been
rectified by there requisite number of State
Assemblies before being presented for the
President's assent. Also, the Speaker's functions
under the Tenth Schedule called for a judicial
determination of issues under the law. The
process of determining the question of disqualification could not be considered part of the
proceedings of the House and, as such, was not
amenable to judicial review. The Supreme Court
struck down Paragraph 7 of the Schedule barring the jurdiction of the Courts and declared
that while operating under the Anti-defection
law, the Speaker was in the position of a
tribunal, and therefore, his decisions like those
of all tribunals were subject to judicial
review.
