The Constitution of India was drawn up by a Constituent Assembly. The Assembly met for the first time 
on December 9, 1946. It was not a truly representative body as its members were indirectly elected by 
those who were themselves elected on a narrow franchise. The Assembly constituted a Drafting Committee, 
under the chairmanship of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar, to frame a constitution for India. Indian Constitution was 
adopted on November 26, 1949 and it came into effect on January 26, 1950.  It is the longest written 
Constitution in the world containing 395 Articles, 22 Parts and 12 Schedules. During 60 years of its 
existence, Indian Constitution has undergone several amendments and demand to review it completely has 
also been raised. But, inspite of all these changes, the "basic structure" of constitution remain 
intact.<br>


<h3>Development of the Indian Constitution</h3><br>
British rule in India ended on 15th August 1947 and India emerged as an independent and sovereign 
republic. Certain features of Indian Polity or Constitution can be understood better.<br>

with a brief review of the constitutional set up in the preceding periods. As modern political 
institutions originated and developed in India mainly during the British rule, the origin and 
growth of the Indian Constitution has its roots in the British period of Indian history. 
The British came to India in the 17th century as traders. From 1773 onwards, various Acts were 
passed by the British Government for the governance of India.

<h3>Sources of Indian Constitution</h3><br/>
The sources of Indian Constitution include the imaginative aspirations of the nationalist leaders, the 
actual working of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the experience gained from the actual working 
of some of the Constitutions of important countries of the world. Moreover, its sources include not only 
the sources upon which the founding fathers of our Constitution drew but also the developmental sources 
such as the judicial decisions, constitutional amendments, constitutional practices and so on.<br/><br/>
The sources of the Indian Constitution can thus be divided into the following two categories:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constituent Assembly Debates:</i></strong></div>
Constituent Assembly was constituted under the Cabinet Mission plan to frame the Indian Constitution. 
Its members included distinguished lawyers, intellectuals and patriots who took two years, eleven months 
and eighteen days to prepare the constitution. During the course of this period, debates on all the aspects 
of the Constitution were held in a free and fair manner. These debates produced an intelligent opinion in 
the light of which every word of the Constitution was screened carefully and intelligently.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reports of Committees of the Constituent Assembly:</i></strong></div>
The Constituent Assembly appointed various types of committees to make reports on different aspects. 
Some of the most important committees  included Union Powers Committees, Union Constitution Committee,
Provincial Constitution Committee, etc.  Advisory Committed on the rights of citizens, minorities and tribal 
and excluded areas and hoc Committee regarding the Supreme Court Committee on financial relations between the
 Union and States. The reports of these committees were thoroughly discussed in the Drafting Committee. It 
 was on the basis of the reports made by such committees that the draft of the Constitution was prepared.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nehru Report:</i></strong></div>

The british Government had announced the formation of the Simon Commision for making a report on the working
 of the Government of India Act, 1919 and suggest constitutional measures required for the efficient 
 administration of Indian. The Congress decided to boycott this Commision because no Indian was taken on it. 
 Instead it announced the formation of a committee under the leadership of Motilal Nehru  to make 
 recommendations about the desired constitutional set up for India. The Committee made certain recommendations
  which are known as the Nehru Report. The main Clauses of this Report were : 
 <ul>
<li>grant of Empire;</li>
<li>Creation of a federal structure for India </li> 
<li>bicameralism at the Centre;</li>   
<li>Parliamentary and responsible Government in Provinces;</li>  
<li>guarantee of Fundamental Right;</li>
<li>establishment of Supreme Court as the final court of appeal.</li>
 </ul>
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lahore Session of the Congress:</i></strong></div>

The Congress at its Lahore session held in 1929 resolved to make India a Republic.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Objectives Resolution:</i></strong></div>

Jawharlal Lal Nehru moved in the Constituent Assembly the Objectives Resolution embodying the aspirations 
of nationalist India. The Objectives Resolution clearly spelled out making India a sovereign republic where 
the ultimate supreme power should be vested with the people. It stated that the people would get social, 
economic and political justice, liberties of all types and equality. Upliftment of the backward people and 
areas would be ensured and the structure of the country would be federal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Government of India Act 1935:</i></strong></div>

 At the time the Constitution for free India was being framed, India was governed by the Government of India 
 Act, 1935. The fathers of the Indian Constitution drew heavily on the experience and the provisions of this 
 Act. According to Jennings - "The Constitution derives directly from the Government of India Act, 1935 from 
 which, in fact, many of its provision are copied textually."

 <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of Various Constitutions:</i></strong></div>
 
 The founding fathers of the Indian Constitution were wise enough to borrow from the experience gained in 
 the working of various other Constitutions. It is on this account that the Constitution of India is 
 regarded as a bag of borrowing from the various working Constitutions 

<ul>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>British Constitution:</i></strong></div>

<br>

<li><b>Development Sources</b>
Indian Constitution is not a static doument. It has growmn with the changing needs. Thus amendments, judicial 
decisions, political practices, Parliamentary status, rules, regulations and ordinances are the developmental
sources of the Constitution.
<ul>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Amendments of the Constitution:</i></strong></div>
    During the
course of 60 years the Constitution has been amended about 94 times and a few other amendments are in the 
pipeline. In this way, the present shape of the Constitution is quite different from the original document. 
The 42nd Amendment made it clear that the Indian Constitution is more flexible than rigid. This Amendment is 
often termed as 'the mini Constitution of India' due to enormous changes it
effected to the Indian Constitution.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Decisions:</i></strong></div>
     The judicial decisions
given by the Supreme Court on important issues
have added new dimensions to the Constitution. It is in the light of such decisions that
further constitutional amendments are made in
the Constitution. Some of the most important
judicial decisions are:
<ul>
    <li>Gopalan vs. State of Madras;</li>
    <li>State of Madras vs. Champakam;</li>
    <li>Golak Nath vs. State of Punjab;</li>
    <li>Keshavanand Bharti vs. Kerala State</li>
</ul>

    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliamentary Statutes:</i></strong></div>
     Parliament has also
made various statues for furnishing details of the
various Articles contained in the Constitution. It
is the Constitution which itself empowers the
Parliament to enact laws on certain Articles for
details. These statues are considered as constitutional laws. Without their existence, a detailed
study of the Constitution is not possible.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commentaries of Constitutional Experts:</i></strong></div>
    While interpreting the Constitution, the views
of the distinguished constitutional experts,
whether Indian or foreign, enjoy special importance. The most notable constitutional experts
are Jennings, Gledhill, Alexandrowit, D.D. Basu,
Palkhiwala, V.N. Shukla, etc. Their views are
not given legal recognition but due regard is
paid to them by the judges. Moreover, true
significance of any provision of the Constitution
can be understood in the light of their views.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rules, Regulations, Ordinances, etc.:</i></strong></div>
     Each House of the Parliament is empowered to make
rules for its efficient working. The President has also
got the right to make rules for fixing the constitutional subjects. President of India is also empowered to 
make rules with respect to the condition of services of the members of the Union Public Service
Commission. He can also frame rules to establish peace and efficient administration of the Union Territories.
Above all, the President has also the power to issue ordinances when Parliament is not in session. All these 
rules, regulations and ordinances serve as sources of the Constitution.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Practices :</i></strong></div>
    Although the Constitution of India is the most detailed in the world, still certain practices 
    independent of the Constitution have developed in India.
    A few examples of such a practice can be enumerated as follows.
    <ul>
        <li>The Central Government takes before hand the advice of the State Government in the appointment 
            of its Governer.</li>
        <li>Governer can be recalled by the Central Government on the advice of the State Government concerned.</li>
        <li>Governer should not belong to the state to which he is appointed.</li>
        <li>One of the judges of the Supreme Court must belong to the minority community.</li>
        <li>The senior most judge of the Supreme Court should be appointed as the Chief Justice of India.</li>
        <li>The leader of the majority party in Lok sabha is appointed as the Prime Minister.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Nature and Features Of Indian
Constitution</h3>
Every constitution aims to build up a governmental structure based upon certain basic
principles. And these principles are more or less
well established. Although some of these principles are common to most constitution, there
are others which vary from constitution to
constitution. The constitution of India is not an
exception to this rule and it has its own basic
principles. India, a union of states, is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic.
The constitution of a country is the basic or
supreme law. Indian constitution is federal in
structure but with unitary features. It is a
lengthy and legalistic document, but reasonably
flexible. Its major features include.
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Popular Sovereignty</i></strong></div>

Indian Constitution proclaims the sovereignty
of the people in its Preamble itself. The idea is
reaffirmed in several places in the Constitution,
particularly in the chapter dealing with elections.
Article 326 declares that "the elections to the House
of people and the Legislative Assembly of every
state shall be on the basis of adult suffrage". As a
result, the Governments at the Centre and in the
States derive their authority from the people who
choose their representatives for Parliament and the
State Legislatures at regular intervals. Further,
those who wield the executive power of the government are responsible to the legislature and
through them to the people. Thus, in the affairs of
the State, it is the will of the people that prevails
ultimately and not the will of a few individuals.
This is the principle of popular sovereignty.
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rule of Law</i></strong></div>

According to this axiom, people are ruled by
law but not by men, that is, the basic truism that
no man is infallible. The axiom is vital to
democracy. More important is the inherent
meaning that the 'law' is the sovereign in democracy. The chief ingredient of law is custom 
which is nothing., but the habitual practices and beliefs of common people over long years.
In the final analysis, rule of law means the sovereignty
of the common man's collective wisdom. Apart
from this crucial meaning, rule of law means a
few more things like
(a) there is no room for arbitrariness;
(b) each individual enjoys some fundamental
rights; and
(c) the highest judiciary is the final authority in
maintaining the sanctity of the law of the land.
It is this spirit that make Article 14 (all are
equal before law and all enjoy equal protection of
laws) meaningful, like providing legal assistance
to the needy, promotion of Lok Adalats and the venture of the Supreme court known as 
"public interest litigation". Also, as per today's law of the land, any litigant can 
appeal to the presiding judicial authority to argue the case by himself or seek legal 
assistance with the help of judiciary.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Review</i></strong></div>
The right of the judiciary to review executive acts and legal enactments when they are not 
in conformity with the established law of the land and its procedures is known as judicial 
review.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialism</i></strong></div>
Increasing intervention as well as participation by the State in the economic field has been
a distinguishing feature of the twentieth century. There is hardly any country today in
which the State is not actively engaged in a
variety of economic activities. In varying degrees, governments everywhere are involved in
economic, industrial, commercial management.
This is broadly described as the influence of
socialist ideas on State activity. Even before the
adoption of a new Constitution, the Government of independent India had made clear its
policy to enter the economic field in a very
active manner. The Industrial Policy Resolution
of 1948 gives ample evidence of this. It envisaged a greater role for the State in the economic
development of the country. Certain industries
such as atomic energy, manufacturing of arms
and ammunition were declared to be the sole
monopoly of the State. The right of the State to
nationalise any major industry and bring it
within the public sector was also clearly stated.
The Directive Principles of State Policy, however, unmistakably set out the socialist objective
of the Constitution; although one might point
out that they do not go far enough to establish
a full fledged socialist order.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialism in Constitutional Amendments</i></strong></div>
Successive amendments to the Constitution
of India clearly show that the direction is more
towards the realisation of socialist than the
democratic ideal. The constitution was amended
several times with a view to realising this
objective. Among those amendments, special
mention may be made of the First, Fourth,
Seventeenth, Twenty fifth, Twenty ninth, Thirty
fourth and Forty second Amendments. Almost
all of these gave precedent to the Directive
Principles over Fundamental Rights in the implementation of certain legislative enactments. The
Forty second Amendment (1976) went a step
further and amended the permeable of the Constitution to include specifically the term "socialist"
which was absent in the original form in which it was enacted.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF A SECULAR
    DEMOCRACY?
</i></strong></div>
The distinguishing features of a secular democracy
as contemplated by the Constitution of India are:
<ol>
<ul>
    <li>
    The State will not identify itself with or be controlled by any religion
    </li>
    <li>
    While the State guarantees to everyone the right to
profess whatever religion one chooses to follow (which
includes also the right to be an antagonist or an atheist),
it will not accord an preferential treatment to any of them
    </li>
    <li>
    No discrimination will be shown by the State
against any person on account of his religion or faith
    </li>
    <li>
    The right of every citizen, subject to any general
condition, to enter any office under the state will be
equal to that of the fellow citizens. Political equality
which entitles any Indian citizen to seek the highest
office under the State is the heart and soul of secularism as envisaged by Constitution.
    </li>
</ul>
</ol>

</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Securalism</i></strong></div>

Indian Constitution aims to establish a secular state. This does not mean that the State in
India is anti-religious. India has declared its
identity as a "Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic." The attributes of Socialist and
Secular were added in 1976 by the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution. The bulky document
does not attempt to define secularism. However,
a definition is derived from the fundamental
right that proclaims that "The State shall not
discriminate against any citizen on grounds of
religion, race, caste, sex place of birth or any one
of them.' The Indian State has no religion of its
own. The fundamental right of speech and
freedom also means the right to preaching and proselytising religion. This is 
made clearer in
Articles 25-28, "Subject to public order, mortality and health... all persons are equally entitled
to freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion". Every
religious denomination or any section thereof
shall have the right to establish and maintain
institutions for religious and charitable purposes, to maintain its own affairs in matters of
religion. No person shall be compelled to pay
any taxes for promotion of any particular religion. No religious instructions shall be provided
in any educational institutions wholly  maintained out of the State funds.

<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HOW THE CONSTITUTION ENSURES
    INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY?
</i></strong></div>
In its bid to establish complete independence of the
judiciary, the Indian Constitution has first erected a wall
of separation between the executive and the judiciary.
After effecting such separation, it has created conditions
that are conducive to making the judiciary independent.
Thus, rigid qualifications are laid down for the appointment of Judges and provision has been made for compulsory consultation of the Chief justice of India in the
appointment of every judge of the Supreme Court and
the High Courts. Conditions of service of a Judge cannot be altered to his/her disadvantage, 
once he/she is appointed. Judges are given high salaries and their conduct is made a subject beyond
the scope of discussion in the legislature. They cn be removed from the office only for proved 
misbehaviour. For this purpose, both the houses of parliament will have to pass resolutions 
aganist the judges supported by a two third majority of those who sit and vote and atleast an 
absolute majority of the total membership of the house. 

</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Independence</i></strong></div>
The framers of Indian Constitution were
aware that democratic freedom was meaningless in the absence of an independent machinery
to safeguard it. No subordinate or agent of the government could be trusted to be just and
impartial in judging the merits of a conflict in
which the government itself was a party. Similarly, a judiciary, subordinate either to the Center
or the State could not be trusted as an impartial
arbiter of conflicts and controversies between the
Center and the State. These were compelling
reasons for the creation of an independent judiciary as an integral part of the Constitution and
for the adoption of judicial independence as a
basic principle of the Constitution.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHY THE FRAMERS OF INDIAN CONSTITUTION
CHOSE 'FEDERALISM'?</i></strong></div>

The framers of Indian Constitution turned to federalism as a solution of a number of problems they
confronted in their attempt to frame a constitution of a
new united India. Particularly, they wanted to preserve
both the "infinite variety and the innate unity" that animated the length and breadth of India. The choice of
federalism as a constitutional form and as the basis
of a national government in India was not a sudden
development upon the transfer of power on 15th August, 1947. It was there for many years and, in a limited form, it was already in operation in British India.
For the resolution of the constitutional problem of a
multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-communal country
like India with a vast area and a huge population, federalism was only a natural choice. Nevertheless, the
framers were cautious to ensure that the unity they
sought to establish through federalism was of an abiding nature and in case of a future conflict between
that unity and the diversity preserved under the Constitution; the former should prevail over the other. In
other words, it was their intention to create an indestructible Union and the supremacy of the Union over
the states in a number of matters vitally affecting the
interest of the nation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Federalism</i></strong></div>
Federalism is one of the most important
aspects of modern constitutions. It is established
all over the world perhaps, as the only form of
political organization suited to communities with
a diversified pattern of objectives, interests and
traditions, who seek to join together in the
pursuit of common objectives and interests and
the cultivation of common traditions. The basic
objective of federalism is thus unity in diversity,
devolution in authority and decentralisation in
administration. Its fundamental characteristic is
the division of powers between two sets of Governments- a Central Government and State 
Government- each independent of the other in its own sphere of activity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Federal vs. Unitary Features</i></strong></div>
India has two governments functioning at
the national and state levels with a clear cut
distribution of powers. Both the State and the
Union Government, draw their authority from
the Constitution. The supremacy of the Republic lies not with either the Union Government or
the State Governments but with the Constitution. To uphold the legal supremacy of the
Constitution, the power to interpret the constitution has been vested in the judiciary. Thus, the
Indian Constitution has four federal features:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>clear division of powers between the two governments;</li>
        <li>dual system of government</li>
        <li>supremacy of the Constitution;</li>
        <li>authority of the judiciary to interpret the Constitution.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The word 'federation' not been used
anywhere in the Constitution. In fact, India has
been described as a Union of States. The provinces and the princely States were not sovereign
entities before they joined the federation. The
states are not 'inviolable' or 'indestructible' as in
the USA. Parliament can by law change or alter
the areas and boundaries of any State. No state
has the right to secede from the Union. All the
constituent States of the Union are not equal.
The Union Territories do not enjoy the same
status as the States. Unlike the American Constitution, the Indian Constitution does not provide for any safeguards for the protection of the
rights of States. Except Jammu & Kashmir, no
state has its own Constitution as in the U.S.
Whereas the consent of the States is vital for an
amendment of the American Constitution, the
consent of the States in India is necessary only
in regard to a few specific matters.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE 'UNITARY' FEATURES OF
INDIAN CONSTITUTION?</i></strong></div>
There are some unitary features in Indian Constitution. They may be enlisted as below:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliamentary Government</i></strong></div>

The framers of our Constitution preferred
parliamentary system of government. Our infant
democracy could ill-afford any confrontation
between executive and the legislature if they
were separate and independent of each other.
The President of India is the constitutional head
of the Union Executive, but he exercises the
executive power, vested in him, in accordance
with the advice of the Union Council of Ministers. The real executive power thus vests with the
Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as
the head. The Council of ministers is collectively
responsible to the Lok Sabha. The same is true of
the relationship between the Governors and the
Council of Ministers in the States. The parliamentary system of government both at the Centre
and in the State is based on adult suffrage
whereby all citizens of India who are not less
than 18 years of age and not otherwise disqualified by the Constitution or any law, have the
right to vote. It is a bold political experiment in
view of the vastness of the country, its large
population, poverty and illiteracy. Though some
current practices have vitiated the process of
election, adult franchise has not shaped people's
political perceptions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Why the Indian Constitution is lengthy?</i></strong></div>

It is the most lengthy and legalistic constitutional document any country has so far adopted.
One reason is that the Constitution has drawn
from a variety of sources. The other is that the
constitution-makers ensured that no element of
uncertainty was left. It codifies in detail the
relationship between the Union and the States
and the State's interests and contains both justiciable and non-justiciable rights as well as fundamental duties. As the Constitution is not only
a legal document, but an instrument of social
change, it has to be a detailed document in order to ensure that it stands the test of any 
situation in future. Also, care has been taken to ensure that the Constitution is not subverted 
or preverted by any future government, thus, there are numerous in-built constitutional safeguards.
 Another reason for the length of the Constitution is that, there are temporary, transitional 
 and special provisions for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and it also take care of regional 
 problems in states like Gujarat, Maharastra, Andhra pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland and 
 Manipur. The legalistic nature of the Constitution is also partly because of heavy borrowings 
 from the Government of India Act of 1935.
 
 <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rigidity vs. Flexibility</i></strong></div>

Some eminent constitutionalists are of the
view that the Indian constitution is rigid. But,
then how it has been possible to amend the
constitution over 90 times. Indian constitution
is more flexible than the American constitution,
which requires ratification of amendments by
three-fourths of the States. In Indian constitution, only amending of a few provisions requires
ratification of amendments by three fourths of
the states. In our constitution only amending of
a few provisions requires ratification by half of
the State Legislatures. While most of the provisions
of the Constitution can be amended by two thirds majority of each of the Houses of Parliament 
and many of the provisions can be altered or modified by a simple majority. Also, the 
constitution can be supplemented by simple legislations like the Citizenship Act, National 
Security Act and the Untouchability Act etc. Moreover, the scope for the growth of conventions 
to supplement the Constitution makes it more flexible. Conventions govern the privileges and rights 
of the legislature, the functioning of the cabinet system, the status of the Cabinet Secretariat,
etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Single Citizenship</i></strong></div>

In a federation there is usually double citizenship. A citizen belongs to the State in which he
is born and also enjoys the citizenship rights of the
federation, to which his state has joined as a unit.
This is one of the basic principles of federalism,
that the states in a federation are units of federation, but do not give up their individual entity. But
in India, there is single citizenship. Citizens belong
to the Indian Union and not to any state. Provision
for single citizenship for the whole of India was
perhaps intentional. The constitution fathers did
not like that regionalism and other disintegrating
tendencies which had already raised their ugly
heads and were endangering the very security
and integrity of country, should be further encouraged by providing double citizenship. Provision
for double citizenship would have naturally stood
on the way of emotional and national integration.
The people in the State would have thought more
in terms of the State than the country as a whole.
Single citizenship has undoubtedly forged a sense
of unity among the people of India and image of
United India is reflected by this provision.

<h3>Preamble</h3>
The PREAMBLE to the Indian Constitution (as
amended in 1976) reads:
WE, THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a
SOVEREIGN SOCIALIST SECULAR DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its
citizens:
JUSTICE, social, economic, and political
LIBERTY of thought, expression, belief, faith
and worship;
EQUALITY of status and of opportunity;
and to promote among them all
FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the
individual and the unity and integrity of the
Nation;
IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this
twenty-sixth day of November, 1949, do
hereby ADOPT, ENACT and GIVE TO OURSELVES this Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Objectives of Indian Constitution</i></strong></div>
The preamble sets out the main objectives of
the Constitution; the objective which the Constitution-makers intended to be realised through it.
It is the key to open the mind of the Constitutionmakers. The preamble is a legitimate aid in the
construction of the provisions of the Constitution. Generally, for purposes of interpretation,
the preamble of the Constitution stands in the same position as the preamble of an Act.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Purposes of the Preamble</i></strong></div>
The farmers of the Constitution of India set
out two purposes in the preamble.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        First, to constitute India into a Sovereign
Democratic Republic. It is Republic because
the head of the State is not a hereditary
monarch. It is Democratic because the Constitution rests on the people's will, and the
institutions set up under it shall seek to give
effect to democratic principles. It is Sovereign because the Constitution does not
recognise the legal supremacy of another
country over India. Her membership of the
Commonwealth of the Nations is not inconsistent with her independent and sovereign
status. The words 'socialist' and 'secular'
were added in the Preamble by the Fortysecond Amendment. The addition of 'socialist' indicates the incorporation of the philosophy of 'socialism' in the Constitution
which aims at elimination of inequality in
income and status and standards of life and
may enable the courts to lean more and
more in favour of nationalisation and State
ownership of an industry. It is yet to be seen
how the new economic policy adopted by
the Narsimha Rao Government since 1991
oriented towards free market and
privatisation is to be viewed in the courts.
The word 'secular' simply recognises the
concept of secularism as manifested in the
guarantee of freedom of religion as a fundamental right in the Constitution.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE
PREAMBLE?</i></strong></div>
The preamble specifies the source of authority, the
system of government, the objectives to be attained by
the political system and the date of the adoption and
enactment of the Constitution. Though the Preamble
is not enforceable in a court of law and generally, not
considered a part of the Constitution, it provides a key
to the understanding and interpretation of the Constitution; it has, therefore, been described as the soul of
the Constitution. In case of doubt the Supreme Court
has referred to the Preamble to elucidate vague aspects of the Constitution.

</div>
</div>

        </li>
        <li>
        Second, to secure to citizens justice - social,
economic, and political; liberty of thought,
expression, faith, and worship; equality of
status and opportunity; and to promote
among the people of India fraternity, assuring dignity of the individual and the unity
and integrity of the nation. Although the
expressions, 'justice', 'liberty', 'equality', and
'fraternity', may not be susceptible to exact
definitions, yet they are not mere platitudes.
They are given content by the
enacting provisions of the Constitution
particularly by Part III of the funda-mental
rights and Part IV, the Directive Principles
of State Policy.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Explanation of Preamble</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sovereign Republic</i></strong></div>

The Preamble begins with the words, "We,
the people of India....", thus clearly indicating
the source of all authority under the Constitution. 
The Preamble establishes the ultimate soverity of the people of India on whose authority 
the Constitution rests. It points out the Constitution of  India has been ordained by the
people of India through their representatives in
Constituent Assembly.
In the present times, the term 'sovereignty'
may be losing rigid connotations of "supreme
and absolute power acknowledging no superior" -no modern state can be considered sovereign in that sense. However, through the words
of the Preamble, what is sought to be established
is the oneness of the people of India (not the
people of different states but of one nation), that
the sovereignty vests in the collectivity, and that
the people of India are not subordinate to any
external authority. With the enactment of the
Constitution, India was no longer a 'dominion'
it was a 'republic'.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IS PREAMBLE A PART OF THE CONSTITUTION?</i></strong></div>
The preamble of an Act is not recognised as part of
the Act because it is not enacted and adopted by the
enacting body in the same manner as the acting provisions. The preamble of Indian Constitution was, however, enacted and adopted by the same procedure as
the rest of the Constitution. This difference was not
brought to the notice of the Supreme Court in Berubari
Union and Exchange of Enclaves case where it observed
that "the preamble is not part of the constitution". Later
when the constituent history of the preamble was brought
to the notice of the Court in Keshavananda Bharti v. State
of Kerala it held that "the preamble of the Constitution
was part of the COnstitution and the observations to the contrary in Berubari Union case were
not correct".
The recognisation of the preamble was an integral part of the Constitution makes the preamble 
a avaluable aid in the construction of the provisions of the COnstitution because unlike 
the preamble to an Act, the preamble
of the Constitution occupies the same position as other
enacting words or provisions of the Constitution.
</div>
</div>

A republic derives its powers directly or
indirectly from the people and "is administered
by persons holding their offices during pleasure,
for a limited period, or during good behaviour"
(Madison). India is a republic in that sense. From
January 26, 1950 when the Constitution commenced, India ceased to owe allegiance to the
British crown. India has a President as head of
the Union, elected indirectly for a fixed term by
the people's representatives. All citizens are equal
in law, there is no privileged class, every citizen
has the right to try for any public office irrespective of caste, race, sex or religion.
Despite declaring itself a republic India
remained a member of the Commonwealth of
Nations. Indeed the group of nations
accommodated India's status as a sovereign
independent republic owing no allegiance to the
British Crown: the 'British Commonwealth of
Nations' became simply 'Commonwealth of
Nations'. The King or Queen would be the
'symbolic' head of he Commonwealth as far as
India was concerned, and the decisions at the
conferences of the Commonwealth will not be
binding on Indians. India's conduct would be
based on 'free will'. The decision to remain in the
Commonwealth was in keeping with the ideal of
promoting international cooperation and peace
- a concept expressed in our Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Democracy</i></strong></div>

The term 'democracy' has assumed different
connotations for different people. But common
to all forms of democracies in the participation 
of the people directly or indirectly. India has
adopted the representative parliamentary
democracy. The Constitution makes no provision
for direct control by the people through such
devices as 'referendum' and 'initiative'. However,
the people of India exercise their sovereignty
through a Parliament at the Centre and a
legislature in each State elected on the basis of
universal adult franchise. The Executive is
responsible to the popular house of the Legislature.
Beyond political democracy, the Preamble
also envisages social and economic democracy.
Equality in the political sphere gives each adult
citizen the power to vote freely. Equality must
also pervade society and economic conditions,
as far as possible. Dr. Ambedkar considered
social and economic democracy to be the real
goals to strive for. Jawharlal Lal Nehru too felt
that political structure would weaken and
disintegrate if socio-economic problems like
poverty and gross inequalities are not tackled
and removed. A vote, after all, does not
mean much to a starving person. It is in
this context that the Preamble speaks of justice,
equality, liberty and fraternity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialism</i></strong></div>

While the original Constitution did not mention
any particular ideology, it did give expression to
the resolve of securing to the citizens economic
justice and equality of opportunity. This is the
essence of socialism. The word 'socialist' was introduced in the Preamble by the 42nd 
Amendment. The term, however, is not defined in The Constitution. It
 may be pointed out that the
socialism envisaged in India does not mean
abolition of private property or nationalisation of
all means of production. Thus a 'mixed economy'
was envisaged, along with provision of equal
opportunity, abolition of vested interests, and
elimination of inequality in income and status and
standards of living. In the present context of
economic liberalisation, however, the socialist
credentials of our State may well be questioned.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Secularism</i></strong></div>

The term 'secular' was inserted in the
Preamble only in 1976, but the state envisaged
by the Constitution was always a secular state
- it could not have been otherwise in a country 
of such a vast size and diversity of culture and
religions. Indeed, the fraternity and unity of the
country could be built only on a secular basis.
The term 'secular', has not been defined in
the Constitution but its operative meaning may
be drawn from the different provisions of the
Constitution. Discrimination on the basis of
religion is forbidden to the State. Equality is
assured to all irrespective of religion. Freedom
of faith, belief and worship is allowed to all. The
State is to be impartial towards all religions.
Furthermore, the state does not uphold any
particular religion as the state religion, but protects all religious equally.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Justice</i></strong></div>

The Preamble speaks of social, economic and
political justice. The concept of justice goes
beyond its narrow legal connotation.
Significantly the words 'social' and 'economic'
occur before the word 'political'.
Social justice implies that discrimination on
the basis of birth, caste, race, sex or religion should
cease. To that end all citizens should enjoy equal
opportunities in the matter of public appointment.
It is the good of all people that the Government
must strive to achieve. The concept of a welfare
state as envisaged in the Directive Principles is an
embodiment of guidelines for ensuring the social
justice expected in the Preamble.
Economic justice implies that the gap between
the rich and the poor is bridged, and the
exploitation ceases. Removal of poverty is to be
achieved not by taking away assets from those
who have but by ensuring a more equitable
distribution of national wealth and resources
among those who contribute to its creation. Thus
the Directive Principles call upon the state to try
and secure ownership and control over resources
to subserve common good, reduce concentration
of wealth, ensure equal pay for equal work, and
see that people, especially women and children,
are not abused or forced by economic want into
work unsuitable for their age or strength.
Political justice implies that all citizens should
have equal opportunity to participate in the
political system. One person-one vote is ensured
irrespective not only of caste, sex or religion, but
also of proprietary or educational qualifications.
It is the basis of the political democracy
envisaged in the Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Liberty</i></strong></div>

Democracy is closely connected with the
idea of liberty; certain minimal rights must be
enjoyed by every person in a community for a
free and civilised existence. These basic rights
are spelt out by the Preamble as freedom of
thought, expression, belief, faith and worship.
The chapter on Fundamental Rights guarantees
these freedoms explicitly, subject to certain
regulations; after all, liberty is not to degenerate
into licence if democracy is to survive.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Equality</i></strong></div>

Rights have no meaning if they cannot be
enjoyed equally by all members of the
community. To ensure that it is possible for all
to enjoy these rights, social and economic
equality is sought to be achieved. The
Fundamental Rights enjoin the State not to
discriminate between citizen and citizen simply
on the basis of caste, race, sex or religion. Public
places are open to all citizens, titles of honour
stand abolished, untouchability is abolished,
among other things. The rule of law is to prevail:
all citizens are equal before law and enjoy equal
protection of the laws of the land. Political
equality is provided by the principle of universal
adult franchise and by allowing, at least in
principle, any citizen the opportunity to
participate in the process of governance.
Economically, the same ability and work entitles persons to the same salary. 
Exploitation of individual or group is to be removed. 

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fraternity</i></strong></div>
A democratic system would function in a
healthy manner only if there is a spirit of
brotherhood of oneness, among the people of
the land. India being a land of immense diversity is all the more in need of this spirit of unity
- the sense of belonging to one nation. The
principle of common citizenship is directed
towards strengthening this sense of 'unity and
integrity' of the nation. Fraternity is also sought
to be promoted by ensuring equal rights to all.
Fraternity, said DR. Ambedkar, "is the principle
which gives unity and solidarity to social life".
It is the feeling that will protect the unity of
India against external attack or disintegration
through internal unrest born of social, political
and economic causes.
<br>
Fraternity, how ever is not possible unless the
dignity of each individual is preserved and respected. Maintaining this dignity requires the
guarantee of certain minimal justiciable rights to
each individual. The ensure that an individual is
free from want and misery - without which
freedom, ideas of self-respect and dignity are
meaningless- the Directive Principles have been
framed calling upon the State to form its policies
to benefit all citizens equally in the matter of
providing adequate means of livelihood. The State is also asked to provide just and humane 
conditions of work and create conditions in
which a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities become possible for all the people of this
land. It is in keeping with the principle of
individual dignity that the practice of untouchability has been abolished by the Constitution.
In the context of fraternity, it may also be
mentioned that India's Constitution goes beyond national boundaries, and speaks of the
ideal of universal brotherhood, an international
fraternity with all nations and peoples coexisting in peace and amity.

<h3>The Union and its Territory</h3>

Part I of the Indian Constitution comprises
four Articles concerned with the territory of
India. Article 1 stipulates that India, that is
Bharat, shall be a Union of States. The States and
territories of India are to be specified in the First
Schedule. It is to be noted that the expression,
'Union of India' includes only the states which
are members of the federal system and share a
distribution of powers with the Union while the
'territory of India' includes the entire area over
which the sovereignty of India extends.
The Indian federation was not the result of
an agreement between independent States. By
the Indian Independence Act 1947, the principal states were given the option of joining India
or Pakistan or remaining independent. The
integration of the princely states was managed
well by Sardar Patel. It may be recalled that in
the original Constitution there were four categories of States and Territories - part A which
included the nine erstwhile provinces of British
India, Part B comprising the five Princely States with legislatures, Part C which includes five
centrally administered states, and Part D mentioning the territory of Andaman and Nicobar
Islands. But since the Seventh Amendment Act,
1956, all the States (except for Jammu & Kashmir) belong to one class and all the constitutional
provisions relating the states apply to all of them
in the same manner. However, it may be pointed
out in this connection that certain special provisions applicable to Maharashtra, Gujarat,,
Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, Andhra Pradesh,
Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram and Goa
override the general provisions pertaining to the
States as a class. As for the administration of
certain Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas within
the States, the provisions are specially listed in
the Fifth and Sixth Schedules

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>'INDIAN TERRITORY' IS OF HOW MANY
TYPES?</i></strong></div>

The territory of India falls under three categories :(i)
State territories, (ii) the Union territories and (iii) territories which may be acquired by the Government of India. No Parliamentary legislation is required to acquire
a foreign territory. It is the inherent attribute of a sovereign State to acquire new territories. Article 1(3) (c), in
including the acquired territory as part of the Indian territory, merely states a factual situation and does not
confer a power on Parliament to acquire foreign territory. The Union Territories are centrally administered
according to provisions contained in Part VII of the Constitution. They are governed by the President through
an Administrator appointed by him.
At present there are 28 states in India. Since 1987,
there are seven Union Territories : Delhi, Andaman
and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Dadra and Nagar
Haveli, Daman and diu, Pondicherry and Chandigarh.
</div>
</div>
Article 1 of the Constitution says that India is a Union of States, and the States and the 
territories thereof are specified in the First Schedule. None
of the constituent units of the Indian Union was
sovereign and independent in the sense the
American colonies or the Swiss Cantons were
before they formed their federal unions. The
Constituent Assembly of India, deriving its power
from the sovereign people, was unfettered by any
previous commitment in evolving a constitutional
pattern suitable to the genius and requirements of
the Indian people as a whole. The Constitution
contemplated changes of the territorial limits of
the constituent States and there was no guarantee
about their territorial integrity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Admission or establishment of new States:</i></strong></div>

Article 2 enables Parliament by law to admit into the Union or establish new States on such
terms as it thinks fit. It will be noted that there
are two powers given to Parliament by Article
2 namely :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        the power to admit into the Union
new States and
        </li>
        <li>
        The power to establish new States.
The first refers to the admission of duly
organised political communities and second to
the admission or formation of a State where
none existed before. It will be recalled that the
territory acquired by the Union becomes Indian
Territory by virtue of clause (3) (c) of Article 1.
No Parliamentary sanction is required for acquisition of teritory. But a territory acquired 
by the Government of India, though factually 
becomes
territory of India from the date of its acquisition,
the formal or legal assimilation is brought about
only by Parliamentary legislation made either
under this article when the acquired territory is
established as a new State of the Union, or
when the acquired territory is merged into an
existing State Under Article 3 of the Constitution.
<br>
The admission or establishment of a new
State will be on such terms and conditions as
Parliament may think fit. There is nothing in the
Constitution which would entitle a new State,
after its formation or admission into the Union,
to claim complete equality of status with a state
existing at the commencement of the Constitution, or formed thereafter under Article 3 of the
Constitution. The analogy of the Australian
Constitution where complete equality of status
with other States and to all "State rights " are
guaranteed is inapplicable to the Indian Constitution, because Section 6 of the Constitution of
Australia expressly provides that the expression
"State" shall include such colonies or territories
as may be "admitted into or established" by the
Commonwealth as States. In India, on the other
hand, Article 2 gives complete discretion to
Parliament to admit or establish new States on
such terms and conditions as "it thinks fit".
Formation of new States and alteration of
areas, boundaries or names of existing States -
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliament may by law -</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        form a new State by separation of territory
from any State or by uniting two or more
States or parts of States or by uniting any
territory to a part of any State;
        </li>
        <li>
        increase the area of any State;
        </li>
        <li>
        diminish the area of any State;
        </li>
        <li>
        alter the name of any State;
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Constitution contemplated changes of
the territorial limits of the constituent States and
there was no guarantee about their territorial
integrity. The new States may be established in
different ways laid down in the article, namely
: (i) by separation of territories from any State (ii)
by uniting two or more States, (iii) by uniting
parts of States and (iv) by uniting any territory
to a part of any State.
The law referred to in Articles 2 and 3 may
alter or amend the First Schedule of the Constitution which sets out the names of the States
and description of territories thereof, and the
Fourth Schedule allotting seats in the Council of
State in the Union Parliament. The law so made
may also make supplemental, incidental and
consequential provisions which would include
provisions relating to the setting up of the
legislative, executive and judicial organs of the
State essential to effective State administration
under the Constitution, expenditure and distribution of revenue, apportionment of assets and
liabilities, provision as to services, application
and adaptation of laws, transfer of proceedings
and other related matters. No State can, therefore, be formed, admitted or set up by law under
Article 4 by Parliament which has not effective
legislative, executive or judical organs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What is the role of States in alteration of Their 
    areas, boundaries or names?</i></strong></div>
In regard to a Bill under Article 3 of Indian
Constitution, there are two conditions. Firstly,
no Bill shall be introduced in either House of
Parliament except on the recommendation of
the President. Secondly, where the proposal
contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries
or name of any of the States, the Bill has to be
referred by the President to the Legislature of
the State for expressing its views thereon. The
period within which the State Legislature must
express its views has to be specified by the
President, but he may extend the time so specified. If the period specified or extended expires
and no views of the State Legislature are received, the second condition laid down in the
provision is fulfilled. Also, it is not necessary to
make fresh reference to the State Legislature
every time an amendment of the proposal contained in the Bill is proposed and accepted in
accordance with the rules of procedure of Parliament so long as the amendment is germane
to the subject-matter of the original proposal or
is not a direct negation thereof.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reorganisations of States</i></strong></div>

The grouping of the states at independence
was done more on the basis of historical and
political principles than social, cultural or linguistic divisions. There was not enough time 
to under take a proper Reorganisation of the units
at the time of making the Constitution. Article
2 empowers Parliament to admit into the Union,
or establish, new States on such terms and
conditions as it thinks fit. By Article 3, Parliament has the power by law to form a new State
from the territory of any State or by uniting two
or more states, increase or decrease the area of
any State, or alter the boundaries or the name
of any State. The only conditions laid down for
the making of such a law are that (i) such a bill
must be introduced only on the recommendation of the President is to refer it to be the
concerned State Legislature which would express its views within a specified period. The
President is not, however, bound by the views
of the State Legislature. However, in the case of
Jammu and Kashmir, the consent of the State
Legislature is required before a bill on such
alterations is introduced in Parliament. Article
4 stipulates that any such law may make supplemental, incidental or other consequential provisions and may amend the First and Fourth
Schedules without going through the Constitutional Amendment process. A simple majority
and ordinary legislature procedure is enough
for Parliament to form new States or alter
existing State boundaries.
It may be noted that these Article does not
apply to cession of territory to a foreign state.
Any treaty or agreement involving ceding Indian Territory to an outside authority requires
a constitutional amendment to be implemented.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>First States Reorganization Commission</i></strong></div>

The Government appointed a commission
under S.K. Dhar to examine the feasibility of
reorganisation of States on linguistic basis. The 
S.K.Dhar Commission preferred reorganisation
for administrative convenience rather than on
a linguistic basis. A Congress Committee under
Jawaharlal Nehru, Sardar Patel and Pattabhi
Sitaramayya (the JVP Committee) too did not
favour a linguistic base. However, in 1953 the
first linguistic state came into being in Andhra
Pradesh, created by separating the Telugu speaking areas from the State of Madras. This followed a prolonged agitating and the death of
Potti Sriamulu after a 56- day hunger strike. As
there were several more demands for States on
a linguistic basis, a commission was set up
under justice F.Fazl Ali with H.N. Kunzru and
K.M. Panikkar, as members to study the demand. This commission is known as the First
States Reorganization Commission. It submitted
its report in 1955. Its suggestions were accepted
with modifications and the States Reorganisation
Act was passed in 1956. As a result, the fourfold
distribution of States was replaced by 14 States
and six Union Territories (Andaman and Nicobar
Islands, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh, Laccadive,
Minicoy and Amandivi, Manipur and Tripura)
vide the Seventh Constitution Amendment.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Acquired Territories</i></strong></div>

Besides, the States and Union Territories, the
territories of India include any area acquired by
India by purchase, treaty, cession or conquest.
These are to be administered by the Government
of India subject to legislation by Parliament.
Thus, the french settlement of pondicherry which was ceded to India by the French Government 
in 1954 was being administered as an acquired territory till 1962 when it was constituted as 
a Union Territory. The Portuguese
territories of Goa, Daman and Diu were acquired by annexation and administered as acquired territory till they were incorporated as
Union Territory in 1961. Goa was given the
status of a State in 1987. Sikkim was admitted
as a full-fledged State of the Indian Union after
a referendum in that country favoured its becoming a constituent unit of India.
It does not matter how the acquisition has
been brought about. It may be by conquest, it
may be by cession following treaty, it may be by
occupation of territory hitherto unoccupied by a
recognised ruler, or it may be under the terms of
an agreement between two States. In cases where
the only fact available is the de facto exercise of
complete sovereignty by one State in a particular
area, the sovereignty of that State over that area
and the area being regarded as part of the
territory of that State would prima facie. Follow.
But this would apply normally only to cases
where sovereignty and control was exercised by
unilateral action. Where, however, the exercise
of power and authority and the right to administer is referable to an agreement between two
States, the question wheather the territory has become integrated with and become part of 
the territory of the State exercising de facto control, depends wholly on the terms
upon which the new government was invited or
permitted to exercise such control and authority.
The precedents are clear that no cession of
Indian territory can take place without a constitutional amendment. However, an agreement to
refer the dispute regarding boundary line dividing
two neighbouring countries and the very fact of
referring such a dispute implies that the executive
may do such acts as are necessary for permanently fixing the boundary. A settlement of a
boundary dispute cannot, therefore, be held to be,
a cession of territory. It contemplates a suitable
boundary, and it is so fixed. The case is one in
which each contending State ex facie is uncertain
of its own right and therefore, consents to the
appointment of arbitral machinery. Such a case is
plainly distinguishable from a case of cession of
territory known to be home territory.

WHAT IS AN 'ACQUIRED
TERRITORY'?</i></strong></div>

A territory can be said to have been acquired when
the Indian Union acquires sovereignty over such territory. The expression 'acquired' should be taken to be
a reference to 'acquisition' as understood in public
international law. If there was any public notification,
assertion or declaration by which the Government of
India had declared or treated a territory as part and
parcel of India, the courts would be bound to
recognise an 'acquisition' as having taken place, with
the consequence that the territory would be part of the
territory of the Union within Articles 1(3) (c). A statement by the Government of India that it did not consider a particular area to have been acquired by it is
binding on the Court.

<h3>Citizenship</h3>
The provisions of citizenship are covered by
Articles 5 to 11 of Indian Constitution and are
embodied in Part II of the Constitution. Article
5 refers to citizenship not in any general sense
but to citizenship on the date of the commencement of the Constitution. It was not the object of this
Article to lay down a permanent law of citizenship
for the country. That business was left to the
Parliament of India. Accordingly, at
the commencement of the Constitution, every person
who had his domicile in the territory of India and
<li>who was born in India, or</li>
<li>either of whose parents was born in India,
or</li>
<li>who had been ordinarily resident in India for
not less than five years immediately preceding the commencement of the Constitution,
was to be considered a citizen of India.</li>
<br>
Persons of Indian origin who had been residing outside India at the commencement of the
Constitution were given the free choice of becoming Indian citizens under the above provisions if
they so desired. The only condition that they had
to fulfill in his connection was to get themselves
registered as Indian citizens by the diplomatic or
consular representatives of India in the country
where they were residing (Art. 8).
Articles 6 and 7 deal with two categories of
persons, namely, those who were residents in India but had migrated to Pakistan and those
who were residents in Pakistan but had migrated to India. Those who migrated from Pakistan 
to India were divided into two categories:
<ol><ul>
    <li>those who came before July 19, 1948 and</li>
    <li>those who came after that date.</li>
</ul></ol>

According to article 6 those who came before July 19, would automatically become citizens on the commencement of the Constitution,
and those who came after July 19 would
become such provided they had been registered
in the form and manner prescribed for this
purpose by the Government of India. These two
articles thus provided for all cases of mass
migration from Pakistan to India without making any distinction between one community
and another, although the partition of the country itself was based upon such as a distinction.
Article 7 provides for those who had migrated to Pakistan but who had returned to
India from Pakistan with the intention of permanently residing in India. Such a provision
had to be made because the Government of
India, in dealing with persons who left India for
Pakistan and who subsequently returned from
Pakistan to India, allowed them to come and
settle permanently under what is called a "permit system'". This permit system was introduced
from July 19, 1948.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Citizenship Act, 1955</i></strong></div>

A comprehensive law dealing with citizens
was passed by Parliament in 1955 in accordance with the powers vested in it by Article 11
of the Constitution. The provisions of the Act
may be broadly divided into three parts, acquisition of citizenship, termination of citizenship
and supplemental provisions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Acquisition of Citizenship</i></strong></div>

The Act provides five modes of acquiring the
citizenship of India. These are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <b>By Birth:</b> Every person born in India on or
after January 26, 1950, shall be a citizen of India by birth. There are two exceptions, to
this rule, namely, children born to foreign
diplomatic personnel in India and those of
enemy aliens whose birth occurs in a place
then under occupation by the enemy.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>By Descent :</b> A person born outside India on
or after January 26, 1950, shall be citizen of
India by descent if his father or mother is a
citizen of India at the time of his birth.
Children of those who are citizens of India
by descent, as also children of non-citizens
who are in service under a government in
India, may also take advantage of this provision and become Indian citizens by descent, if they so desire, through registration.
<b>By Registration :</b> Any person who is not
already an Indian citizen by virtue of the
provisions of the Constitution or those of this
Act can acquire citizenship by registration if
that person belongs to any one of the following five categories :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Persons of Indian origin who are ordinarily
resident in India and who have been so
resident for at least six months immediately
before making an application for
registration.</li>
<li>
Persons of Indian origin who are ordinarily
resident in any country or place outside undivided India;
</li>
<li>
    Women who are, or have been, marrired to citizens of India;
</li>
<li>
    Minor children of persons who are citizens of India
</li>
<li>
    Persons of full age and capability who are citizen of the Common wealth countries or the 
    Republic of Ireland.
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

        </li>
        <li>
     By Naturalisation : Any person who does not
come under any of the categories mentioned
above can acquire Indian citizenship by
naturalisation if his application for the same
has been accepted by the Government of India
and certificate is granted to him to that effect.
An applicant for a naturalisation certificate
has to satisfy the following conditions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        He is not a citizen of a country which
prohibits Indians becoming citizens of that
country by naturalisation;
        </li>
        <li>
        He has renounced the citizenship of the
country to which he belonged;
        </li>
        <li>
        He has either resided in India or has been in
the service of a government in India, normally, for one year immediately prior to the
date of application;
</li>
<li>
During the seven years proceeding the above
mentioned one year, he has resided in India or
been in the service of a government in India
for a period amounting in the aggregate to not
less than four years;
</li>
<li>
He is of good character;
</li>
<li>
    He has an adequate knowledge of a language specified in the Constitution;
</li>
<li>
    If granted a certificate, he intends to reside in India or enter into, or continue in 
    service under a government in India.
</li>        
    </ul>
</ol>
The Act provides, however, for a conspicuous exemption under which any or all of the
above conditions may be waived in favour of a
person who has rendered distinguished service
to the cause of science, philosophy, art, literature, world peace or human progress generally.
Every person to whom a certificate of
naturalisation is granted has to take an oath of
allegiance solemnly affirming that he will bear
true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of
India as by law established, and that he will
faithfully observe the laws of India and fulfill his
duties as a citizen of India.
        </li>
        <li>
<b>By Incorporation of Territory :</b> If any territory becomes part of India, the Government
of India, by order, may specify the persons
who shall be citizen of India by reason of
their connection with that territory.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
       <b>By Renunciation:</b> If any citizen of India
who is also a national of another country
renounces his Indian citizenship through a
declaration in the prescribed manner, he
ceases to be an Indian citizen of registration
of such declaration. When a male person
ceases to be a citizen of India, every minor
child of his also ceases to be a citizen of
India. However, such a child may within
one year after attaining full age, becomes
Indian citizen by making a declaration of his
intention to resume Indian citizenship.
        </li>
        <li>
       <b>By Termination:</b> Any person who acquired
Indian citizenship by naturalisation, registration or otherwise,, of he or she voluntarily
acquired the citizenship of another country
at any time between January 26, 1950, the
date of commencement of the Constitution,
and December 30, 1955, the date of commencement of this Act, shall have ceased to
be a citizen of India from the date of such
acquisition.
        </li>
        <li>
       <b>By Deprivation:</b> The Central Government is
empowered to deprive a citizen of his citizenship by issuing an order under 10 of the
Act. But, this power of the Government may
not be used in case of every citizen; it applies
only to those who acquired Indian citizenship by naturalisation or by virtue only of
clause (c) of Article 5 of the Constitution or
by registration. The possible grounds of such
deprivation are : obtaining of a citizenship
certificate by means of fraud, false representation, concealment of any material fact;
disloyalty of disaffection towards the Constitution shown by act or speech; assisting
an enemy with whom India is at war;
sentence to imprisonment in any country for
a term of not less than two years within the
first five years after the acquisition of Indian
citizenship and continuous residence outside Indian for a period of seven years without 
expressing in a prescribed manner his intention to retain his Indian citizenship. The Act also 
provides for a reasonable safeguards in order to see that a proper procedure is followed in 
every case of deprivation of citizenship 
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Single Citizenship</i></strong></div>

The most important aspect of the constitutional provisions dealing with citizenship is that
it has established a unified or single system of
citizenship law for the whole country. A citizen
of India is accepted legally as a citizen in every
part of the territory of India with almost all the
benefits and privileges that attend such a status.
This is in striking contrast to the system of
double citizenship that prevails in some federal
states. Before the inauguration of the Constitution, there were two broad divisions among
Indian citizens, British Indian subjects and state
subjects. Since there were over 500 Indian States, the State subjects themselves were further subdivided into as many groups of citizens
as there were states. Thus, the term Indian
citizenship had little precise legal significance
except that the Indian people as a whole came
under the overall jurisdictions of the British
Government that ruled India. The abolition of
such distinctions makes the essential unity of
the nation a reality. A single citizenship for the
entire country removes much of the artificial State barriers that prevailed in pre Independence
days and facilities the freedom of trade and commerce  throughout the territory of India.
There is, however one barrier still that hinders that full realisation of the ideal of a single
citizenship established under the Constitution.
This is the existence of what are known as
"domiciliary rule" in the different states in India.
The term "domicile" is difficult to define. According to the rules prevailing today, in the
different States in India, domicile requirements
vary from three to fifteen years' continuous
residence within the State in addition to other
conditions. Thus, the status of domicile is given
only to a permanent resident of the State. On
the basis of such a distinction, there exist practices in different States which amount to gross
discrimination as between citizen and citizen.
The also engender provincialism and parochialism which tend to disrupt the unity to the
nation. Domiciliary rules which govern eligibility to public services in most of the State illustrate this point. Such rules are applied in some
State not only to determine eligibility for appointment to public services but also to regulate
admission to higher educational institutions, the
awards of contracts and rights in respect of
fisheries, ferries, toll-bridges, forests and excise
shops. The conditions to be satisfied for acquiring a domicile in some of the states are of such
an extremely rigorous nature that it is almost
impossible for any person to satisfy them.

<h3>DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY</h3>

Part IV of the Indian Constitution which
deals with the Directive Principles of State
Policy, is directly connected with the Preamble.
The Preamble gives us the fundamental principles on which the Constitution has been
founded and the Directive Principles of State
Policy lay down the fundamental principles
according to which the Constitution is to be
operated. Though the Directive Principles are
not enforceable in a Court, they are fundamental in the governance of the country and it is the
duty of the State to apply these principles in
making laws. The provisions contained in this
Part, shall not be enforceable by any court, but
the principles the in laid down are nevertheless
fundamental in the governance of the country
and it shall be the duty of the State to apply
these principles in making laws.
Part IV (Articles 37 to 51) contains what
may be described as the active obligations of the
State. The State shall secure a social order in
which social, economic and political justice
shall inform all the institutions of national life.
Wealth and its source of production shall not be
concentrated in the hands of the few but shall
be distributed so as to subserve the common
good, and there shall be adequate means of
livelihood for all and equal pay for equal work.
The State shall endeavour to secure the health and strength of workers, the right to his right 
to education is subject to the limits of econbomic capability and development of the State.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What are the different categories of
DPSPs?</i></strong></div>

The Directive Principles covering Article 38
to 51 of the Indian Constitution can be classified
in the following categories:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <b>Socialistic Principles :</b> (i) Adequate means
of livelihood for all citizens; (ii) fair distribution of wealth and material resources among
all classes and to prevent concentration of
wealth in a few hands; (iii) equal pay for
equal work for men as well as women; and
(iv) to secure just and humane conditions of
work and maternity relief.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Gandhian Principles :</b> (i) To organise village
panchayats and to endowing them with
such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them toe function as units
of self-government; (ii) to promote cottage
industries on individual or co-operative basis in rural areas; (iii) the safeguard and
promote the educational and economic interests or the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes; 
(iv) to bring about the prohibition and consumption of intoxicating liquor;
and to organize agriculture and animal husbandary on modern and scientific lines and in 
particular prohibit slaughter of cows. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Liberal Principles :</b> (i) To secure uniform
and liberal code of law for all citizens of
India; (ii) to separate the judiciary from the
executive; (iii) to raise the standard of nutrition and standard of living of the people; (iv)
to protect monuments of historical and national interest; (v) equal justice and free legal
aid to economically backward classes; (vi)
participation of workers in management of
organisations engaged in any industry; and
(vii) promotion and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and
wild life.
        </li>
        <li>
        Provisions relating to be International
Peace and Security : (i) To promote international peace and security ; and to maintain
just and honourable relations between nations; (iii) to foster respect for international
law and treaty obligations; (iv) to encourage
settlement of disputes by arbitration.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IS SUPERIOR - FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS
OR DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES?</i></strong></div>

It is now universally recognised that the difference
between the fundamental rights and the directive principles lies in this that the fundamental rights are primarily aimed at assuring political freedom to the citizens by protecting them against excessive State action
while the directive principles are aimed at securing
social and economic freedom by appropriate action.
The fundamental rights are intended to foster the ideal
of a political democracy and to prevent the establishment of authoritarian rule but they are of no value unless they can be enforced by resort to courts, so they
are made justiciable. However, notwithstanding their
great importance the directive principles cannot in their
nature of things be enforced in a court of law. It is
unimaginable that any court can compel a legislature
to make a law. If the court can compel Parliament to
make laws then parliamentary democracy would soon
be reduced to a oligarchy of judges. It is for this reason 
that the Constitution says that the directive principles shall not be enforceable by courts. However, it
does not mean that the directive principles are less
important than the fundamental rights for the simple
reason that they are not judicially enforceable. Article
37 of the Constitution emphatically states that directive principles are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the
State to apply these principles in making principles in
interpreting the Constitution and the laws. The directive principles thus be interpreted in he light of the
directive principles and the latter should the Constitution must be ever present in the minds of the judges
when interpreting statues which concern themselves
directly or indirectly with matters set out in the directive principles. In Bandhaua Mukti Morcha v. Union of
India52, the Court has also held that thought he directive principles are unenforceable by the courts and
the courts cannot direct the legislature or executive to
enforce them, the State to enforce the law, particularly
when non-enforcement of law leads to denial of a fundamental right.

</div>
</div>

DPSPs explained
State to secure a social order for the promotion of welfare of the people: The State
shall strive to promote the welfare of the people
by securing and protecting as effectively as it
may a social order in which justice, social,
economic and political, shall inform all the
institutions of the national life.
Certain principles of policy to be followed by
the State: The State shall, in particular, direct its
policy towards securing -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        that the citizens, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood.
        </li>
        <li>
        that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are 
so distributed as best to subserve the common good;
        </li>
        <li>
        that the operation of the economic system
does not result in the concentration of wealth
and means of production to the common
detriment;
        </li>
        <li>
        that there is equal pay for equal work for
both men and women;
        </li>
        <li>
        that the health and strength of workers, men
and women, and the tender age of children
are not abused and that citizens are not
forced by economic necessity to enter vocations unsuited to their age or strength;
        </li>
        <li>
        that children are given opportunities and
facilities to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity and
that childhood and youth are protected
against exploitation and against moral and
material abandonment.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

This article specifically requires the State to
ensure for its people adequate means of livelihood, fair distribution of wealth, equal pay for
equal work and protection of children and
labour. Article 39 (b) and (c) together with other
provisions of the Constitution contain the main
objectives, namely, the building of a welfare
society and an equalitarian social order in the
Indian Union. When the Constitution-makers envisaged development in social, economic and 
political fields, they did not desire that it should
be a society where a citizen will have the dignity
of the individual.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Equal justice and free legal aid:</i></strong></div>
 The State shall secure that the operation of the legal
system promotes justice, on a basis of equal
opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide
free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes
or in another way, to ensure that opportunities
for securing justice are not denied to any citizen
by reason of economic or other disabilities.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Organisation of village panchayats:</i></strong></div>
 The State shall take steps to organise village
panchayats and down them with such powers
and authority as may be necessary to enable
them to function as units of self-government.
Under this article, the State is expected to take
steps to organize village panchayats and endow
them with such powers and authority as may
be necessary to enable them to function as units
of self-government. But, this directive is to be
read with the directive contained in Article 50
which lays down the principle of separation of
the executive from the judiciary. The organisation
of village panchayats must be carried out in
practice consistently with Article 50 so as to
maintain the fundamental principle of the rule
of law. Power of the people, which is the soul
of a republic, stands subverted if decentralisation
and devolution desiderated in Article 40 is
ignored by the executive in action even after
holding elections to the floor-level of administrative bodies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Right to work, to education and to public
assistance in certain cases:</i></strong></div>
 The State shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and
 development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education and to
public assistance in cases of unemployment, old
age, sickness and disablement, and in other
cases of undeserved want. The State is directed
by this article to ensure to the people within the
limits of its economic capacity and development: (i) employment, (ii) education, and (iii)
public assistance in cases of unemployment, old
age, sickness and disablement and in other cases
of undeserved want.
Provision for just and humane conditions of
work and maternity relief: The State shall make
provision for securing just and humane conditions of work and for maternity relief. These
directives, like those contained in Article 38,
relate to economic rights.
Living wage etc. for workers - The State shall
endeavour to secure, by suitable legislation or
economic organisation or in any other way, to
all workers, agricultural, industrial or otherwise, work, a living wage, conditions of work
ensuring a decent standard of life and full
enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural
opportunities and, in particular State shall endeavour to promote cottage industries on an or
co-operative basis in rural areas.
This article requires the State to strive to
secure to the worker work, a living age, conditions of work ensuring a decant standard of life
and full enjoyment leisure and social and cultural oppurtunities. The last portion of the 
article lays emphasis on the promotion of cotage industries on an 'individual or co-oprative
basis in rural areas'. Article 43 read with Article
38 requires the State to provide work but not
necessarily a job in State civil service or a
security against the termination of such service
for good cause.
Important cases related to fixation of minimum wages of labourers are -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Bijay Cotton Mills Ltd. v. State of Ajmer</li>
        <li>Standard Vaccum Refining Co. of India v.
Workmen</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Participation of workers in management of
industries:</b> The state shall take steps, by suitable
legislation or in any other way, to secure the
participation of workers in the management of
undertakings, establishment or other 
organisations engaged in any industry. In upholding the right of workers to be heard in the
winding up proceedings of a company, the
court drew support from this article.
Uniform civil code for the citizens: The
State shall endeavour to secure for the citizens
a uniform civil code throughout territory of
India. This article requires on the State to take
steps for establishing a uniform civil code
throughout the territory of India. Two objections were put forward in the Constituent Assembly 
agansit the making of a uniform civil code applying throughout India; firstly it would 
infringe the fundamental right to freedom of
religion mentioned in Article 25 and secondly,
it would be a tyranny to the minority. The first
objection is misconceived. The directive contained in Article 44 in no way infringes the
freedom of religion guaranteed by Article 25.
Clause (2) of that article specifically saves secular activities associated with religious practices
from the guarantee of religious freedom contained in clause (1) of Article 25.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Promotion of educational and economic
interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled
Tribes and other weaker sections:</i></strong></div>
 The State shall promote with special care the educational
and economic interests of the weaker sections of
the people, and, in particular, of the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes, and shall
protect them from social injustice and all forms
of exploitation. In States of Madras v.
Champakam Dorairajan', the Supreme Court
refused to let the Fundamental Right declared
in Article 29(2) to be whittled down by this
article. The Court asserted the supremacy of the
fundamental rights over the Directive Principles
of State Policy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Duty of the State to raise the level of
nutrition and the standard of living and to
improve public health:</i></strong></div>
 The State shall regard
the raising of the level of nutrition and the
standard of living of its people and improvement of public health as among its primary
duties and, in particular, the State shall endeavour to bring about prolongation of the consumption except for medicinal purposes of intoxicating drinks and of drugs which are injurious to health. No one has a legal right to sell
liquor. From the earliest times it has been found
exdpedient to control the use and traffic in
liquor, and this control embraces both regulatory and prohibitory measures. This doctrine
has been recognised by the Directive Principles
of State Policy in this article.
Organisation of agriculture and animal
husbandary: The State shall endeavour to
organise agriculture and animal husbandry on
modern and scientific lines and shall, in particular, take steps for preserving and improving the
breeds, and prohibiting the slaughter, of cows
and calves and other milch and draught cattle.
The protection recommended by this part of the
directive is confined only to cows and calves

potentially capable of yielding milk or of doing
work as draught cattle, but does, not from the
very nature of the purpose for which it is
obviously recommended, extend to cattle, such
thought at one time were milch or draught
cattle have ceased to be such.
Protection and improvement of environment and safeguarding of forests and wild
life: The State shall endeavour to protect and
improve the environment and to safeguard the
forests and wild life of the country. The Environment (Protection Act, 1986 and the Wild Life
(Protection) Act, 1972 as amended in 1986 are
among the steps taken under this article.
Protection of monuments and places and
objects of national importance: It shall be the
obligation of the State to protect every monument or place or artistic or historic interest, 
to be of national importance, from spoilation, disfigurement, destruction, removal,
disposal or export, as the case may be.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Separation of judiciary from executive:</i></strong></div>

The State shall take steps to separate the judiciary from the executive in the public services
of the State. The Constitution has not indeed
recognised the doctrine of separation of powers
in its absolute rigidity but the functions of the
different parts of the branches have been sufficiently differentiated and consequently it can
very well be said that our Constitution does not
contemplate assumption, by one organ or part
of the State of functions that essentially belong
to another. Broadly stated, Article 45 provides
that there shall be a separate judicial service free
from executive control. 

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Promotion of international peace and security:</i></strong></div>

    </ul>
</ol>

</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fundamental Rights vs. Directive
Principles of State Policy</i></strong></div>

It should be remembered that the Preamble,
the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles are all integral parts of the same constitutional edifice. They are all equally important and
have to be read with each other. The emphasis
in the entire scheme of the Constitution under
the headings of the Preamble, the Fundamental
Rights and the Directive Principles is on building
an egalitarian society and on the concept of
socio-economic justice. Inasmuch as the Directive Principles, though declared to be fundamental as guiding principles for making and administering laws, were not made enforceable in
courts of law, they represented subtle compromise between what the framers, as the leaders of
the freedom struggle, looked upon as the ideal or
the goal and what, as realists, they found to be
immediately feasible. The Fundamental Rights
and the Directive Principles together constituted
the soul of the Constitution.
It is now clearly understood that there is no
essential dichotomy between Rights and Duties
or between the Fundamentally Rights and the
Directive Principles. They complement and
supplement each other (Kesavananda Bharti v.
State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC 146). If the Fundamental Rights represent the don'ts for the Government and the legislature, the Directive Principles represent the do's. There is no conflict.
Again, while speaking on the constitution
Fourth Amendment in the Lok Sabha, Nehru
declared that the responsibility for the economic
and social welfare policies of the nation should
lie with Parliament and not with the courts. In
so far as the decisions of courts had shown that
there was some inherent contradiction between
the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles, it was for Parliament to remove the
contradiction and "make Fundamental Rights
subserve the Directive Principles of State Policy."
A distinction is sometimes sought to be made
between what may be called 'positive rights'
and 'negative rights'. Broadly speaking, while
Part III deals with areas of individual freedom
and the extent to which the State can restrain
it, Part IV deals with positive duties cast upon
the State to attain the ideal of social and
economic justice. Even among the fundamental
rights, however, there are some positive injunctions which seek to protect the interests of the
society and the rights of the poor citizens from
encroachment by entrenched sections. Thus,
article 17 abolished untouchability and makes
its practice in any form an offence punishable by law. Article 15 inter alia provides that no 
citizen shall be discriminated aganist in the use of public places like shops, wells, roads,
eating houses etc. on account of his religion, race,
caste, sex or place of birth. Article 23 prohibits
another great social evil, that of forced labour.
The whole effort has been to ensure that the
fundamental rights of the citizens do not degenerate into the liberties of the few against the
interests of the many.

<h3>Fundamental Duties</h3>

The fundamental duties which were added
by the Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution in 1976, in addition to creating and
promoting a culture, also strengthen the hands
of the legislature in enforcing these duties visa-vis the fundamental rights. Even though Part
IV A, laying down certain duties of the Indian citizens, is one of the most valuable parts of the
Constitution. It is also the most neglected.
While the Fundamental Rights provisions
covered the rights of the individual and the
Directive Principles the duties of the State, there
were until 1976 no provisions in our Constitution laying down the duties of the individual.
For every right, there is a corresponding duty.
Duty is an inalienable part of right; the two
represent the two sides of the same coin. What
is duty for one is another's right and vice versa. If all men have a right to life, a duty 
is also cast upon all men to respect human life and not to
injure another person.
Ten Fundamental Duties were incorporated
in the Constitution under Art. 51 A through the
42nd Amendment in 1976 on the recommendation of Swaran Singh Committee. Eleventh duty
was added by 86th Amendment in 2002. These
consist of:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>abiding by the Constitution and national
flag respectively;</li>
<li>to cherish and follow noble ideas of our
freedom struggle;</li>
<li>to maintain integrity;</li>
<li>to render national service when called upon
to do so;</li>
<li>to promote common brotherhood and harmony;</li>
<li>to preserve the rich heritage of our composite culture;</li>
<li>to protect and improve our environment;</li>
<li>to develop scientific temper and humanism;</li>
<li>to abjure violence and;</li>
<li>to strive towards excellence in all spheres of
life.</li>
<li>to provide opportunities for education to
child/ward aged 6-14 years.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The fundamental duties are not justiciable
like Fundamental Rights. However, a person is
liable to punishment if he deliberately violates
them. Like the duties of the State under the
Directive Principles, the duties of citizens also
cannot be enforced by courts. There is no
provision in the Constitution for ensuring their
compliance or for punishing their violation. But
the courts can certainly take them into consideration while construing a law amenable to
more than one interpretation. Article 51 A (g)
regarding protection of environment has particularly come up before the courts. In the
ultimate analysis, the only way to bring about
adherence to fundamental duties is through
public opinion and education in citizenship
values and duties, and building adequate awareness and a congenial climate wherein every
citizen feels proud and bound to perform his
constitutional duties to the nation and pay his
debt to society.

<h3>President of India</h3>

In the parliamentary set up of Government,
the Executive is responsible for legislation. The
British model of parliamentary form was found
to be most viable for Indian set up. In this system
of parliamentary democracy, President, who is
indirectly elected, is also the Head of the State.
The executive powers of the Union Government
are vested in the President. The President is also
the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.
There is no constitutional bar on the number of
time a person can be elected as President. The
convention of two-terms, which was started in
Nehruvian period, did not last too long and
from the last few Presidents Indians have resorted to one-term convention. The President is
not a member of either House of Parliament or
for that matter a State Legislature. The term of
the office is five years though there are provisions that it can be terminated in between. It
can be terminated on four infra mentioned
grounds : (1) by resignation in writing to the
Vice President of India; (2) by impeachment for vioaltion of the Constitution;
(3) by death, and (4) invalidation of President's election by the
Supreme Court of India.
What qualifications are required for the
office of the President of India?
In order to be qualified for election as the
President of India, a person must ---
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>be a citizen of India;</li>
        <li>have completed the age of thirty-five years;</li>
        <li>be qualified for election as a member of the
House of the People; and</li>
        <li>must not hold and office of profit under the
Government of India or the Government of
any State or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said
Governments [Art. 58]</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
But a sitting President or Vice-President of the
Union or the Governor of any State or a Minister
either for the Union or for any State is not
disqualified for election as President [Art 58]

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Election of The President</i></strong></div>
The President is elected by an electoral college consisting of elected members of both Houses
of Parliament and the State Legislative Assemblies. In this provision, the term "State" includes
the National Capital Territory of Delhi and the
Union Territory of Pondicherry. Indirect election is is restorted to becuase President is 
supposed to be a nominal titular Head of the State acting on the advice of Council of 
Ministers headed by
the Prime Minister. Members of the State Legislative Councils are excluded from participating in President's election. In the Electoral College each member has one vote though the value
of each vote is different from one State to the
other. Likewise, the value of vote of the Member
of Parliament also differs from the value of vote
of the members of a Legislative Assembly. The
election does take account of the fact that States
have their uniform representation and parity is
maintained between the Union and the States.
This is also culminated into the fact that federal
ethos is further strengthened.
Why indirect election of President was supported by the framers of Indian Constitution?
Indirect election of President gives recognition
to the status of the States in the federal system. The
system of indirect election was criticised by some
as falling short of the democratic ideal underlying
universal franchise, but indirect election of President was supported by the framers of the Constitution the following grounds:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct election by an electorate of some one
billion of people would mean a tremendous
loss of time, energy and money</li>
<li>Under the system of responsible Government
introduced by the Constitution, real power
would vest in the ministry; so, it would be
anomalous to elect the President directly by
the people without giving him real powers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Term of Office of President</i></strong></div>

The President's term of office is five years
from the date on which he enters upon his
office; but he is eligible for re-election [Arts 56-57]. 
The President may resign his office by
writing under his hand addressed to the Vice
President of India,
He can also be removed from his office for
violation of the Constitution, by the process of
impeachment [Art. 56]. The only ground for
impeachment specified in Art. 61(1) is 'violation
of the Constitution'.
Procedure for impeachment of the
President
An impeachment is a quasi-judicial procedure
in Parliament. Either House may prefer the charge
of violation of the Constitution before the other
House which shall then either investigate the charge
itself or cause the charge to be investigated. But the
charge cannot be preferred by a House unless-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>a resolution containing the proposal is moved
after a 14 days' notice in writing signed by
not less than 1/4 of the total number of
members of that House; and</li>
<li>the resolution is then passed by majority of
not less than 2/3 of the total membership of
the House.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The President shall have a right to appear and
to be represented at such investigation. If, as a result
of the investigation, a resolution is passed by not less
than 2/3 of the total membership of the House
before which the charge has been preferred declaring that the charge has been sustained, 
such resolution shall have the effect of removing the President from his office with effect 
from the date
on which such resolution is passed [Art. 61].
Since the Constitution provides the mode and
ground for removing the President he cannot
removed otherwise than by impeachment in
accordance with the terms of Arts. 56 and 61.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conditions of President's Office</i></strong></div>

The President shall not be a member of either
House of Parliament or of a House of the
legislature of any State, and if a member of
either House of Parliament or a House of the
Legislature of any State be elected President, he
shall be deemed to have vacated his seat in that
House on the date on which he enters upon his
office as President shall not hold any other office
of profit [Art 59 (1)].

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Powers & Functions of The President</i></strong></div>

The Constitution says that the "executive power of the Union shall be vested in the
President" [Art. 53]. The President of India shall
thus be the head of the 'executive power' of the
Union. Before we take up an analysis of the
different powers of the Indian President, we
should note the constitutional limitations under
which he is to exercise his executive powers. It
may be said that the powers of the President
will be the powers of his Ministers, in the same
manner as the prerogatives of the English Crown
have become the 'privileges of the people' (Dicey)
An inquiry into the powers of the Union Government, therefore, presupposes an inquiry into
the provision of the Constitution which vest
powers and functions in the President.
The Indian Constitution, by its various provisions, vests the following powers in the hands
of the President under the expression 'executive
power', subject to certain limitations.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Executive Powers:</b>The executive power
of the Union is vested in the President. The
executive power does not only mean the execution of laws passed by the legislative but also the
powers to carry on the business of the Government, However, it is evident that President is
not free to use his powers, rather he acts
(binding) on the advises of the Council of
Ministers. In this regard, the 42nd Amendment
is a mile-stone. The 44th Amendment, however, did loosen the grip to some extent as it
gave the President of India the right to return a bill for reconsideration of the Cabinet and is
bound to give his consent when returned. In
broad perspective, one can say that administrative powers of the President include administrative powers and military powers. Administratively, the President may not discharge any
function as there are ministries responsible for
such an act. This way President becomes a
formal head and action is taken in his name.
In the matter of administration, not being a
real head of the Executive like the American
President, the Indian President shall not have
any administrative function to discharge nor
shall he have that power of control and supervision over the Departments of the Government
as the American President possesses. But though
the various departments of Government of the
Union will be carried on under the control and
responsibility of the respective Ministers in
charge, the President will remain the formal
head of administration, and as such, all executive action of the Union must be expressed to be
taken in the name of the President. The only
mode of ascertaining whether an order or instrument is made by the Government of India
will be to see whether it is expressed in the name
of the President and authenticated in such
manner as may be prescribed by rules to be
made by the President [Art. 77]. For the same
reason, all contacts and assurance of proper
made on behalf of the Government of India
must be expressed to be made by the President and executed in such a manner as the President 
may direct or authorise [Art. 299] 
<br>
Again, though he may not be the 'real' head
of the administration, all officers of the Union
shall be his 'subordinate' [Art. 53(1)] and he
shall have a right to be informed of the affairs
of the Union. [Art. 78(b)]. The administrative
power also includes the power to appoint and
remove the high dignitaries of the State.
Under Indian Constitution, the President
shall have the power to appoint -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Prime Minister of India.</li>
        <li>Other Ministers of the Union.</li>
        <li>The Attorney - General for India.</li>
        <li>The Comptroller and Auditor General of
India</li>
        <li>The judges of the Supreme Court.</li>
        <li>The judges of the High Courts of the
States.</li>
        <li>The Governor of a State</li>
        <li>A commission to investigate interference
with water-supplies.</li>
        <li>The Finance Commission.</li>
        <li>The Union Public Service Commission and
joint Commissions for a group of States.</li>
        <li>The Chief Election Commissioner and other members of the Election Commission.</li>
        <li>A Special Officer for the Dchedule Castes and Tribes.</li>
        <li>A Commission to report on the administration of Scheduled Areas.</li>
        <li>A Commission to investigate into the condition of backward classes</li>
        <li>A Commission on Official Language</li>
        <li>Special Officer for linguistic minorities.</li>
    
    </ul>
</ol>

In making some of the appointments, the
President is required by the Constitution to
consult persons other than his ministers as well.
Thus, in appointing the Judges of the Supreme
Court, the President shall consult the Chief
Justice as he may deem necessary [Art. 124(2)].
These conditions will be referred to in the proper
places, in connection with the different offices.
The President shall also have the power to
remove
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>his Ministers, individually;</li>
        <li>the Attorney-General for India;</li>
        <li>the Governor of a State;</li>
        <li>the Chairman or a member of the Public
Service Commission of the Union or of a
State, on the report of the Supreme Court;</li>
        <li>a judge of the Supreme Court or of a High
Court or the Election Commissioner, on an
address of Parliament.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>
        </li>
        <li>

        <b>Legislative Powers:</b> With regard to the
legislative powers of the President, the Constitution of India is largely different from the
American Constitution. The separating line of
executive and legislation is not as strong as in
case of the U.S.A. In India, President is both
Executive Head and also the part of legislature.
The President has power to summon and prorogue Parliament. He can also dissolve the Lok
Sabha before the expiry of five year term. The
President also enjoys the power to summon a
joint sitting of both House of Parliament in case 
of difference between the two. The President
also addresses the opening session of a newly
elected Parliament. He can also address it
jointly in between. The President also enjoys
the power to nominate certain member of the
Parliament. In Rajya Sabha 12 members are
nominated and 2 members from Anglo-Indian
communities are nominated to the Lok Sabha if
the community has not been adequately represented in his opinion in the House. Certain Bills
do require a previous sanction of the President
like money bill, the bill involving expenditure
from the Consolidated Fund India, bill for the
formation of a new state, bill relating to language, and the bill affecting the taxation of
state. The bill passed by the parliament cannot
become an Act before it has president's assent.
He can, after his comments, return the bill
limited in case of money bill. Thus legislative
powers of the Indian President may be summarized as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Summoning, Prorogation, Dissolution:</b> Like
the English Crown, our President shall have
the power to summon or prorogue the
Houses of Parliament and to dissolve the
lower House. He shall also have the power
to summon a joint sitting of both Houses of
Parliament in case of a deadlock between
them. [Arts. 85, 108].</li>
        <li><b>The Opening Address:</b> The President shall
address both Houses of Parliament assembled
together, at the first session after each general at the commencement of the first session 
of each year, and "inform Parliament of the
causes of its summons" [Art. 87]. The practice during the last four decades shows that
the President's Opening Address is being
used for purposes similar to those for which
the 'Speech from the Throne' is used in
England viz. to announce the programme of
the Cabinet for the session and to raise
debate as to the political outlook and matters
of general policy or administration. Each
House is empowered by the Constitution to
make rules for allotting time "for discussion
of the matters referred to in such address
and for the precedence of such discussion
over other business of the House."</li>
<li><b>The Right to Address and to send Messages:</b> Besides the right to address a joint
sitting of both Houses at the commencement
of the first session, the President shall also
have the right to address either House or
their joint sitting, at any time, and to require
the attendance of members for this purpose
[Art. 86(1)] This right is no doubt borrowed
from the English Constitution, but there it is
not exercised by the Crown except on ceremonial occasions.
Apart from the right to adress, the Indian President shall have the right to send messages 
to either House of Parliament either in regard
to any pending Bill or to any other matter, and
the House must then consider the message
"with all convenient despatch" [Art. 86(2)].
Since the time of George III, the English Crown
has ceased to take any part in legislation or to
influence it and messages are now sent only on
formal matters. The American President, on the
other hand, possesses the right to recommend
legislative measures to Congress by messages
thought Congress is not bound to accept them.
The Indian President shall have the power to
send messages not only on legislative matters
but also 'otherwise'. Since the head of the Indian
Executive is represented in Parliament by his
Ministers, the power given to the President to
send message regarding legislation may appear
to be superfluous, unless the President has the
freedom to send message differing from the
Ministerial policy, in which case again it will
open a door for friction between the President
and the Cabinet.
It is to be noted that during the first fifty-five
years of the working of our Constitution, the
President has not sent any message to Parliament nor addressed it on any occasion other
than after each general election and at the
opening of the first session each year.
</li>
<li>
<b>Nominating Members to the Houses:</b>Though the main composition of the two
Houses of Parliament is elective, either direct
or indirect, the President has been given the
power to nominate certain members to both
the Houses upon the supposition that adequate representation of certain interests
will not be possible through the competitive
system of election. Thus, (i) In the Council of States, 12 members are to be nominated
by the President from persons having special
knowledge or practical experience of literature, science, art and social service [Art.
80(1)]. (ii) The President is also empowered
to nominate not more than two members to
the House of the People from the AngloIndian community, if he is of opinion that
the Anglo-Indian community is not adequately represented in that House [Art.
331].
</li>
<li>
<b>Laying Reports, etc., before Parliament:</b>
The President is brought into contact with
Parliament also through his power and study
to cause certain reports and statements to be
laid before Parliament, so that Parliament
may have the opportunity of taking action
upon them. Thus, it is the duty of the
President to cause to be laid before Parliament - (a) the Annual Financial Statement
(Budget) and the Supplementary Statement,
if any; (b) the report of the Auditor-General
relating to the accounts of the Government
of India; (c) the recommendations made by
the Finance Commission, together with an
explanatory memorandum of the action
taken thereon; (d) the report of the Union
Public Service Commission, explaining the
reasons where any advice of the Commission has not been accepted; (e) the report of
the Special Officer for Scheduled Castes and
Tribes; (f) the report of the Commission on Backward Classes; (g) the report 
of the Special Officer for Linguistic Minorities. 
</li>
<li>
<b>Previous sanction to Legislation:</b> Constitution requires the previous sanction or
recommendation of the President for introducing legislation on some matters, though,
of course, the Courts are debarred from
invalidating any legislation on the ground
that the previous sanction was not obtained,
where the President has eventually assented
to the legislation [Art. 255]. These matters
are:
(g) Assent to legislation and Veto: (A) Veto
over Union Legislation.
A Bill will not be an Act of the Indian
Parliament unless and until it receives the assent
of the President. When a Bill is presented to the
President, after its passage in both Houses of
Parliament, the President shall be entitled to
take any of the following three steps.
(i) He may declare his assent to the Bill; or
(ii) He may declare that he withholds his assent
to the Bill; or
(iii)He may, in the case of Bills other than
Money Bills, return the Bill for reconsideration of the Houses, with or without a message suggesting amendments. A Money Bill
cannot be returned for reconsideration. In case of (iii), if the Bill for reconsideration 
of the Houses, with or without amendment and again presented to the President, it would be 
obligatory upon him to declare his assent to it [Art. 111]
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nature of the Veto Power</i></strong></div>

Generally speaking, the object of arming the
Executive with this power is to prevent hasty
and ill-considered action by the Legislature. But
the necessity for such power is removed or at
least lessened when the Executive itself initiates
and conducts legislation or is responsible for
legislation, as under the Parliamentary or Cabinet system of Government. As a matter of fact,
though a theoretical power of veto is possessed
by the Crown in England, it has never been used
since the time of Queen Anne.
Where, however, the Executive and the
Legislature are separate and independent from
each other, the Executive, not being itself responsible for the legislation, should properly
have some control to prevent undesirable legislation. Thus, in the United States, the President's
power of veto has been supported on various
grounds, such as (a) to enable the President to
protect his own office from aggressive legislation; (b) to prevent a particular legislation from
being placed on the statue book which the
President considers to be unconstitutional (for
thought the Supreme Court possesses the power
to nullify a statue on the ground of unconstitutionally, it can exercise that power only in the
case of clear violation of the Constitution, regardless of any question of policy, and only if
a proper proceeding is brought before it after
the statue comes into effect); (c) to check legislation which he deems to be 
practically inexpedient or, which he thinks does not represent the
will of the American people.
From the standpoint of effect on the legislation, executive vetos have been classified as
absolute, qualified, suspeasive and pocket vetos.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Absolute Veto:</b> The English Crown possesses the prerogative of absolute veto, and
if it refuses assent to any bill, it cannot
become law, notwithstanding any vote of
Parliament. But this veto power of the Crown, has become obsolete since 1700, owing to the
development of the Cabinet system, under
which all public legislation is initiated and
conducted in the legislature by the Cabinet, judged by practice and usage, thus, there is_
at present no executive power of veto in England.</li>
<li>
<b>Qualified Veto:</b> A veto is 'qualified' when
it can be overridden by an extraordinary
majority of the Legislature and the Bill can
be enacted as law with such majority vote,
overriding the executive veto. The veto of the
American President is of this class. When a
Bill is presented to the President, he may, if
he does not assent to it, return the Bill within
10 days with a statement o of this objection,
to that branch of Congress in which it
originated. Each House of Congress then
reconsiders the Bill and if it is adopted again
in each House, by a two-thirds vote of the
members present, - the Bill becomes a law,
notwithstanding the absence of the
President's signature. The qualified veto is 
then overridden. But, if it fails to obtain that
two-thirds majority, the veto stands and the
Bill fails to become law. In the result, the
qualified veto serves as a means to the
Executive to point out the defects of the
legislation and to obtain a reconsideration
by the Legislation but ultimately the extraordinary majority of the Legislature prevails.
The qualified veto is thus a useful device in
the United States where the Executive has no power of control over the legislature, by prorogatio, 
dissolution or otherwise.
</li>
<li>
<b>Suspensive Veto:</b>A veto is suspensive when
the executive veto can be overridden by the
Legislature by an ordinary majority. To this
type belongs the veto power of the French
President. If, upon reconsideration, Parliament passes the Bill again by a simple majority, the President has no option but to
promulgate it.</li>
<li><b>Pocket Veto:</b> There is a fourth type of veto
called the 'pocket veto' which is possessed by
the American President. When a Bill is presented to him. He may neither sign the Bill
nor return the Bill for reconsideration within
10 days. He may simply let the Bill lie on his
desk until the ten-day limit has expired. But,
if in the meantime, Congress has adjourned
(i.e., before expiry of the period of ten days
from presentation of the Bill to the President), the Bill fails to become a law. This
method is known as the 'pocket veto', for, by
simply withholding a Bill presented to the
President during the last few days of the
session of Congress the President can prevent the Bill to become law.</li>
</ul>
</ol>


<b>Disallowance of State Legislation:</b> Besides
the power to veto Union Legislation, the
President of India shall also have the power
of disallowance or return for reconsideration
of a Bill of the State Legislature, which may
have been reserved for his consideration by
the Governor of the State [Art. 201].
Reservation of a State Bill for the assent of the
President is a discretionary power of the Governor of a State. In the case of any Bill presented
to the Governor for his assent after it has been
passed by both Houses of the Legislature of the
State, the Governor may, instead of giving his
assent or withholding his assent, reserve the Bill
for the Consideration of the President.
<b>Power of Issuing Ordinance (Art -123):</b>
The President has a very strong position in the
sense that he has the power of issuing ordinance. In case there is a matter of urgency and
a law is needed for a particular situation, the
President can issue ordinance. The 38th Amendment in this regard is a mile stone in the sense
that his assent is important. The 38th Amendment passed in July 1975 put beyond judicial
scrutiny the "satisfaction" of the President in
declaring emergency. The ordinance can be
promulgated by the President when the Houses
of Parliament are not in session. The ordinance
will have the same effect of the law of the land.
<b>Judicial Powers:</b> The President enjoys
judicial powers as well. He has the power to
grant pardons, reprieves, suspension, remission
or condonation of a punishment or sentence by
court martial. The power of pardon of the
President pertains to such offences that relate to
violation of acts under the Union List. The
President's pardon could be sought for any
death sentence.
<b>Emergency Powers:</b> The President also
enjoy emergency power. This is important
because in a federal structure the grip of the
Union on the State is not so tight and hence the
Constitution framers did provide for the exigencies which may require a tight grip of the Union
on the State. Emergency can be declared due
to external aggression or armed rebellion or
internal disturbance. President of India enjoys
nominal power as he basically acts on the advices of the Council of Minister. Article 356
is much in controversy because it gives powers to the President for extension of his rule in 
the State. "If the President on receipt of report
form the Governor of a State or otherwise, is
satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the
Government of the State cannot be carried
on....; the President may extend his rule to the
State. Article 360 deals with financial emergency "If the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or
credit of India or of any part of the territory is
threatened ... the President can declare financial
emergency. The 38th Amendment (clause 5)
has furthered the strength of the President in
this regard as his decision is final and cannot be
challenged in the Court of law.
The extraordinary powers of the President
are of three kinds:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>) Firstly, the President is given the power to
make a "Proclamation of Emergency" on the
ground of threat to the security of India or any
part thereof, by war, external aggression or
armed rebellion. The Object of this Proclamation is to maintain the security of India and its
effect is, inter alia, assumption of wider control
by the Union over the affairs of the States or
any of them as may be affected by armed rebellion or external aggression.</li>
<li>
    Secondly, the President is empowered to make a Proclamation that the Government
   of State cannot be carried on in accordance
with the provisions of the Constitution. The
break-down of the constitutional machinery
may take place either as a result of a political
deadlock or the failure by a State to carry out
the directions of the Union [Arts. 356, 365].
By means of a Proclamation of this kind, the
president may assume to himself any of the
governmental powers of the State and to
Parliament the powers of the Legislature of
the State.</li>
<li> Thirdly, the president is empowered to declare that a situation has arisen whereby
"the financial stability or credit of India or
of any part thereof is threatened" [Art. 360].
The object of such Proclamation is to maintain the financial stability of India by controlling the expenditure of the States and by
reducing the salaries of the public servants,
and by giving directions to the States to
observe canons of financial propriety, as
may be necessary.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<b>Other Powers:</b> The President also enjoys
the power of appointment and removal of high
dignitaries of the State including Prime Minister. The President is the Commander -in-Chief
of Armed Forces and appoints Service Chiefs of
Army, Navy and Airforce. The exercise of his
military powers, however, is regulated by laws
made by Parliament. The President also has
diplomatic powers as he appoints and receives
ambassadors. The treaties with other countries
are also signed in his name.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The President has the constitutional authority to make rules and regulations relating to
various matters, such as, how his orders and instruments shall be authenticated; the paying into custody of and withdrawal of
money from, the public accounts of India; the
number of members of the Union Public
Service Commission, their tenure and conditions of service; recruitment and conditions
of service of persona serving the Union and
the secretarial staff of Parliament; the prohibition of simultaneous membership of Parliament and of the Legislature of a State; the
procedure relating to the joint sittings of the
Houses of Parliament in consultation with the
Chariman and the Speaker of the two Houses;
the manner of enforcing the orders of the
Supreme Court; the allocation among States
of emoluments payable to a Governor appointed for two or more States; the discharge
of the functions of a Governor in any contingency not provided for in the Constitution;
specifying Scheduled Castes and Tribes; specifying matters on which it shall not be necessary for the Government of India to consult
the Union Public Service Commission.</li>
<li>
He has the power to give instructions to a
Governor to promulgate an Ordinance if a
Bill containing the same provisions requires
the previous sanction of the President under
the Constitution [Art. 213(1), Proviso].
</li>
<li>He has the power to refer any question of
public important for the opinion of the Supreme Court and already eight such reference 
have been made since 1950 [Art. 143]</li>
<li>
He has the power to appoint certain commission for the purpose of reporting on specific
matters, such as, Commissions to report on the
administration of Scheduled Areas and welfare of Scheduled Tribes and Backward Classes;
the Finance Commission; Commission on
Official Language; an Inter-State Council.
</li>
<li> He has some special powers relating to
'Union Territories', or territories which are
directly administered by the Union. Not only
is the administration of such Territories to be
carried on by the President through an
Administrator, responsible to the President
alone, but the President has the final legislative power (to make regulations) relating
to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands; the 
Lakshadweep; Dadra and Nagar Haveli; 22
and may even repeal or amend any law
made by Parliament as may be applicable to
such Territories [Art, 240].
</li>
<li>
The President shall have certain special powers
in respect of the administration of Scheduled
Area and Tribes, and Tribal Areas in Assam:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Subject to amendment by Parliament, the
President shall have the power, by order, to
declare an area, to be a Scheduled Area or declare that an area shall cease to be a 
Scheduled Area , alter the boundaries of Scheduled Areas</li>
<li>
A Tribes Council may be established by the
direction of the President in any State having Scheduled Areas and also in States
having Scheduled Tribes therein but no
Scheduled Areas.</li>
<li>All regulations made by the Governor of a
State for the peace and good government of
the Scheduled Areas of the State must be
submitted forthwith to the President and
until assented to by him, such regulations
shall have no effect.</li>

<li>The President may, at any time, require the
Governor of a State to make a report regarding
the administration of the Scheduled Areas in
that State and give directions as to the administration of such Areas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol> 

</li>
<li>
The President has certain special powers
and responsibilities as regards Scheduled
Castes and Tribes:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Subject to modification by Parliament, the
President has the power to draw up and
notify the lists of Scheduled Castes and Tribes
in each State and Union Territory. Consolation with the Governor is required in the case
of the list relating to a State. [Arts. 341-342].</li>
<li> The President shall appoint a Special Officer
to investigate and report on the working of the
safeguards provided in the Constitution for
the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. [Art. 338].</li>
<li> The President may at any time and shall at
the expiration of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution, appoint a
Commission for the welfare of the Scheduled Tribes in the States [Art. 339].</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vacancy in Office of the President</i></strong></div>

A vacancy in the office of the President may
be caused in any of the following ways—
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On the expiry of his term of five years</li>
        <li>By his death</li>
        <li>By his resignation.</li>
        <li>On his removal by impeachment.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, e.g. on the setting aside of his
election as President [Art. 65(1)].</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>When the vacancy is going to be caused by
the expiration of the term of the sitting
President, an election to fill the vacancy
must be completed before the expiration of
the term [Art. 62(1)]. But in order to prevent
an 'interregnum', owing to any possible delay
in such completion, it is provided that the
outgoing President must continue to hold
office, notwithstanding that his term has
expired, until his successor enters upon his
office [Art. 56(1)(c)]. (There is no scope for
the Vice-President getting a chance to act as
President in this case.)</li>
<li>In case of a vacancy arising by reason of any
cause other than the expiry of the term of the
incumbent in office, an election to fill the
vacancy must be held as soon as possible
after, and in no case later than, six months
from the date of occurrence of the vacancy.
Immediately after such vacancy arises, say,
by the death of the President, and until a
new President is elected, as above, it is the Vice-President who shall act as President 
[Art. 65(1)]. It is needles to point out that the new President who is elected shall be
entitled to the full term of five years from the
date he enters upon his office.</li>
<li>
Apart from a permanent vacancy, the President may be temporarily unable to discharge
his functions, owing to his absence from
India, illness or any other cause, in which
case the Vice-President shall discharge his
functions until the date on which the President resumes his duties. [Arrt. 65(2)]

He must act according to the advice given to him by
the Council of Ministers, headed by the Prime Ministers, so that refusla to act according to such advice

<h3>Relations Between Union &
States</h3>


The Constitution of India provides a dual
polity with a clear division of powers between
the Union and the States, each being supreme
within the sphere allotted to it. The States in
India are not the creation of the Centre nor do
they draw their authority from the Union Government. On the other hand, like the Union
Government, they draw their authority directly
from the Constitution and are free to operate in
the field allocated to them by the Constitution.
At the outset, it may be noted that the Constitution of India has made most elaborate provisions regarding relationship between the Union
and the States. This was done with a view to
minimize the conflicts between the Centre and
the States. But the actual operation of the
Centre-State relations for all these years has
given rise to a controversy about the wisdom of
arrangements made under the Indian Constitution.
Critics have expressed doubts about the existing
arrangements and demanded re-allocation and
adjustment of the Centre-State relations. The relations between the Centre and the States can be
conveniently studied under the following categories.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LEGISLATIVE RELATIONS</i></strong></div>

The Union State relations in the legislative
sphere have been dealt by Articles 245 to 254. 
The Constitution clearly provides that the Parliament shall have exclusive 
jurisdiction to make law for the whole or any part of the territory
of India with regard to subjects mentioned in
the Union List. This list contains 97 subjects like
defence, foreign affairs, currency, union duties,
communication, etc. On the other hand, the
State enjoys exclusive power over the 66 items
enumerated in the State List. This List contains


<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT IF THE LAW OF THE UNION
AND THE STATE
GOVERNMENT COME INTO CLASH WITH
 EACH OTHER?</i></strong></div>
 If the law of the Union Government and the State
Government come into clash with each other the former
prevails. However, a State law on the Concurrent List
shall prevail over the Central law if the same had been
reserved for the consideration of the President and his
consent had been received before the enactment of
the Central law on the same subject. This clearly gives
some leeway to the States.
</div>
</div>

subjects like public order, health, sanitation,
agriculture etc. In addition, there is a Concurrent list containing 47 subjects like criminal law
and procedure, marriage, contracts, trust, social
insurance etc. over which both the Union and
the State Governments can legislate. The constitution also vests the residuary powers (viz.,
enumerated in any of the three Lists) with the
Central Government. It may be noted that in this
distribution of powers, the Union Government
has certainly been given a favoured treatment. It
has not only been granted more extensive powers
than the States, even the residuary powers have
been granted to it contrary to the convention in
other federations of the world, where the residuary powers are given to the States.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Union's power to legislate on States'.
subjects</i></strong></div>

Though under ordinary circumstances the
Central Government does not posses power to
legislation on subjects enumerated in the State
List, but under certain special conditions the
Union Parliament can make laws even on these
subjects. In the following cases Union Parliament
can legislate on the subject listed in the State List.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>If the Rajya Sabha declares by a resolution
supported by not less than two thirds of the
members present and voting that it is necessary or expedient in the national interest
that the Parliament should make laws with respect to any matter, enumerated in the State
List, specified in the resolution. After such a
resolution is passed it is lawful for the Parliament to make laws for the whole or any part
of the territory of India with respect to that
matter while the resolution remains in force.
Such a resolution remains in force for a period
of one year and can be further extended by one
year by means of a subsequent resolution. It
may be observed that this provision has been
used only in very few cases and has not added
to the powers of the Parliament</li>
<li>The Parliament can legislate on the subjects
mentioned in the State List when the Proclamation of Emergency has been made by the
President on grounds of internal disturbances
or external aggression. However, the laws
thus made by the Parliament shall cease to
have effect on the expiration of a period of
six months after the Proclamation has ceased
to operate, except as respects things done or
omitted to be done before the expiry of the
said period. Thus, during emergency the
Parliament can legislate on subjects in all the
three lists and the Federal Constitution gets
converted into unitary one.</li>
<li>The President can also authorise the Parliament to exercise the powers of the State
legislature during the Proclamation of Emergency due to breakdown of constitutional
machinery in a state. But all such laws
passed by the Parliament cease to operate six
months after the Proclamation of Emergency comes to an end.</li>
<li>The Parliament can also be authorised to
legislate on a state subject if the legislatures
of two or more states feel it desirable that
any of the matters with respect to which the
Parliament has no power to make laws for
the states should be regulated in such states
by Parliament by law and if resolutions to
that effect are passed by legislatures of those
states. Thereafter, any act passed by the
Parliament shall apply to such states and to
any other state by which it is adopted
afterwards by resolution passed in that behalf by the house, or, where there are two
houses, by each house of the legislature of
that state. The Parliament also reserves the
right to amend or repeal any such act.</li>
<li>The Parliament can make law for the whole
or any part of the territory of India for
implementing any treaty, agreement or convention with any other country or countries
or any decision made at any international
conference, association or other body. Any
law passed by the Parliament for this purpose cannot be invalidated on the ground
that it relates to the subject mentioned in the
state list.</li>
<li>Certain bills passed by the state legislature
have to be reserved by the Governor of the
state for the consideration of the President.
These bills become law only after the President gives his assent. The bills which the
Governor must reserve for the consideration
of the President relate to compulsory acquisition of property, or those which adversely
affected the Powers of the High Court.
It is quite evident from the above discussion
that the Union enjoys a position of superiority
in the legislative sphere and at times the states
are completely at its mercy.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ADMINISTRATIVE RELATIONS</i></strong></div>

The administrative jurisdiction of the Union
and the State Governments extends to the subjects in the union list and state list respectively,
which clearly establishes the superiority of the
Union Government in the administrative sphere
as well. In addition, the Constitution contains
a number of provisions which accord a position
of superiority to the Union Government.
Article 256 lays down that the executive
power of every state shall be so exercised as to
ensure compliance with the laws made by
Parliament and any existing laws which apply
in that State, and the executive power of the
Union shall extend to the giving of such
directions to a state as may appear to the
Government of India to be necessary for that
purpose. Similarly, Article 257 of the Constitution provides that the executive power of every
state shall be so exercised as not to impede or
prejudice the exercise of the executive power of
the Union, and the executive power of the
Union shall extend to giving of such directions to a state as may appear to the Government of
India to be necessary for that purpose. In short,
the Union Government can issue directions to
the state Government even with regard to the
subjects enumerated in the state list.
    

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Union's power to give Directions</i></strong></div>

The Union Government can also give directions to the state with regard to construction
and maintenance of the means of communication declared to be of national or military
importance. It can also ask the state Governments to construct and maintain means of
communication as part of its functions with
respect to naval, military and air force works.
It can also issue them necessary directions
regarding the measures to be taken for the
protection of the railways within the jurisdiction of the state. It may be noted that the
expenses incurred by the state Governments for
the discharge of these functions have to be
reimbursed by the Union Government. It may
be noted that the state Governments cannot
ignore the directions of the Union Government,
otherwise the president can take the plea that
the Government of the state cannot be carried
on the accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution and impose President's rule on the
state. In such an eventuality the President shall
assume to himself all or any of the functions of
the state Government. The President of India
can also entrust to the officers of the State
certain functions of the Union Government.
However, before doing so the President has to
take the consent of the state Government.
Further, the extra cost incurred by the states in
the discharge of these obligations has to be
reimbursed by the Union Government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>All-India Services</i></strong></div>

The presence of the All India Services like
the Indian Administrative Services, and the
Indian police Services etc. further accords a
predominant position to the Union Government. The members of these services are recruited and appointment held by the Union
Public Service Commission. The members of
these services are posted on key posts in the
states, but remain loyal to the Union Government. The right to create new All India Services 
also rests with the Union Parliament. The
Union Parliament can create a new All India
Service only if the Rajya Sabha passes a
resolution by two-thirds majority of the members present and voting that it is necessary in the
national interest to do so.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Water Disputes</i></strong></div>

The Parliament has been vested with power
to adjudicate any dispute or complaint with
respect to the use, distribution or control of the
waters of, or in any inter-state river of river-valley.
In this regard, the Parliament also reserves the
right to exclude such disputes from the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or other Courts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Responsibility of the Union</i></strong></div>

Under the Constitution, it is the responsibility of the Union Government to protect the
states from external aggression and internal
disturbances. This leaves much scope for
Centre's interference in the spheres of the state.
The President can declare national emergency
in case of war or possible threat of war as well
as armed rebellion. During this emergency the
Centre can give directions to the states as to the
manner in which their executive power is to be
exercised. The President can authorise the
Parliament to make laws with respect to any
matter including power to make laws conferring powers and imposing duties or authorising
the conferring of power and the imposition of
duties upon the Union officers and authorities
of the Union as respects that matter unmindful
of the fact, that the matter does not belong to
the Union list. Similarly, it is the duty of the
President to ensure that the government of the
state is carried on in accordance with provisions
of the Constitution. If the President is satisfied
that the government of the state cannot run
along constitutional lines, he can declare constitutional emergency in the state and assume to
himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the state and all powers of the State
other than those exercised by the legislature and
High Court of the State. The President can also
declare that the powers of the state legislature
shall be exercised under the authority of the
Parliament and make such incidental and
consequential provisions as appear to him to be 
necessary or desirable for giving effect to the
objects of the Proclamation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Role of Governors</i></strong></div>

The Central Government exercises effective
administrative control over states through the
Governors of State who are appointed by the
President and hold office during his pleasure.
The Governors can reserve certain bills passed
by the State legislatures for the consideration of
the President. President can also issue directions and orders to the Governor which are
binding on him. Thus, the Centre can exercise
effective control over the States through the
Government to topple State Governments which
are irksome to the Central Government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial System</i></strong></div>

As the Constitution of India provides for a
single judicial system both the Union and the
State Governments are duty bound to give full
faith and credit to public acts, records, proceedings and judicial decisions of the Supreme Court
and the High Court. The manner in which
these acts, records and proceedings have to be
preserved is determined by Parliame`nt by law
and the states do not have any say in this
regard. In the matter of appointment of the
Chief Justice and the Judges of the Supreme
Court as well as the High Courts, the states
have no say. They are appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice of
India and such other judges of the supreme
courts and the High Court as he deems fit to
consult. The initiative for the removal of these
judges also rests with the Parliament which can
pass necessary resolution for their impeachment
and recommend to the President to take necessary action. The States are in no way connected
with the appointment or removal of the judges
of the Supreme Court or High Court.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>State Government's Power</i></strong></div>

The State Governor can entrust conditionally or unconditionally certain functions with
respect to the executive powers of the state to
the officers of the Union with the consent of the
Union Government. (Article 258A). It may be 
observed that the original Constitution did not
contain this provision. This provision was
added through Seventh Amendment in 1956
in view of the objections by the Comptroller and
Auditor-General over construction of Hirakund
Dam by the Central Government on behalf of
the Orissa Government and debiting of cost to
the state accounts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of the 42nd Amendment Act</i></strong></div>

A new turn was given to the Centre-State
Relations in the administrative sphere by the
Forty- Second amendment of 1976, which
empowered the Central Government to deploy
armed forces for dealing with any grave situation of law and order in the States. The
contingents so employed were to act in accordance with the instructions of the Central
Government and not to work under the direction, superintendence and control of the state
government concerned, unless specifically directed by the Central Government. This change
naturally greatly restricted the autonomy of
the states and was resented by the states.
Ultimately this provision was nullified by the
44th Amendment.
It is thus, evident that in the administrative
sphere the states cannot act in complete isolation
and have to work under the directions and in
cooperation with others of the federation.

<h3>Financial Relations</h3>

Generally, in typical federation alongwith the
distribution of legislative and administrative powers,
the financial resources of the country are also so
distributed as to ensure financial independence of
the units. However, the Indian Constitution does
not make a clear cut distribution of the financial
resources and leaves much to be decided by the
Central Government from time to time. The financial resources which have been placed at the disposal
of the state are so meagre that they have to look up
to the Union Government for subsidies and contributions. The distribution of financial resources in
India has broadly been made as follows.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Taxes Exclusively assigned to the Union</b>
Income from certain subjects like customs and export duties, income tax, excise duty on
tobacco, jute, cotton etc., corporation tax, taxes
on capital value of assets of individuals and
companies; estate duty and succession duty in
respect of property and other than agricultural
land; and income from the earning departments
like the railways and postal departments have
been exclusively assigned to the Union Government by the Constitution.</li>
<li><b>Taxes exclusively assigned to States</b>
Income from land revenue, stamp duty except on documents included in the Union List;
succession duty and estate duty in respect of
agricultural land; income -tax on agricultural
lands; taxes on goods and passengers carried by
road or inland water; taxes on vehicles used on
roads, animals, boats, taxes on the consumption
or sale of electricity, tolls, taxes on lands and
buildings; taxes on professions, traders, calling
and employment; duties on alcoholic liquors for
human consumption, opium, Indian hemp and
other narcotic drugs, taxes on the entry of goods
into local areas, taxes on luxuries, entertainments, amusements, betting and gambling, etc.
has been assigned to the States.</li>
<li><b>Taxes Leviable by Union but collected and
appropriated by the State</b>
The taxes on the following items are levied
by the Union Government but the actual
revenue from them is collected and appropriated by the States; (i) stamp duties on bills of
exchange, cheques, promissory notes, bills of
landing, letters of credit, policies of insurance,
transfer of shares etc.; (ii) Excise duties on
medicinal toilet preparation containing alcohol
or opium or Indian hemp or other narcotic
drugs.</li>
<li><b>Taxes levied and collected by the Union
but assigned to states</b>
The taxes in this category are levied and
collected by the Union Government although they
are subsequently handed over to the states where
from they have been collected. Such taxes included duties in respect of succession to property
other than agricultural land; state duty in respect
of property other than agricultural land terminal
taxes on goods or passengers carried by railways, 
sea or air, taxes on railway freights and fares;
taxes other than stamp duties on transactions in
stock exchanges and future markets; taxes on the
sale or purchase of newspapers and on advertisements published therein; taxes on purchase or sale
of goods other than newspapers where such sale
or purchases take place in the course of inter - state
trade or commerce.</li>
<li><b>Taxes levied and collected by the Union
but shared with the States</b>
Taxes on income other than agricultural
income and excise duties other than those on
medicinal and toilet preparations are levied and
collected by the Union Government but shared
with the states on an equitable basis. The basis
of distribution is determined by the Parliament
through a law.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<h3>Centre - State Relations:
Tension Areas</h3>

Arising out of the nature of Centre - State
relations as well as difference in political ideology of the ruling parties at the Centre and
States, following major areas of tensions have
emerged in Indian federalism.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Role of Governor as a representative of the
central Government with regard to appointing and dismissing 
State ministers and dissolution of the State Assemblies.</li>
<li>Misuse of powers of imposition of President's

<li>Reservation of Bills for the consideration of

<li>Sharing of finances, and central approval of

Within these five major areas, there are

State relations</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Role of Governor</i></strong></div>

Since 1967, when the monopoly of the Congress Party was shattered, the role of Governor
has assumed greater significance. This has
further become so because of nature of multiparty system and prevalence of the phenomenon of defections. In this the ruling party at
the Centre has found in the office of Governor 
an effective instrument to assume power for
itself. During seventies and eighties in particular, the office of Governor was used to topple
down the State Governments on one pretext or
the other. Apart from toppling or dismissing
ministries, the Governors have also started interfering in the State Government's affairs in the
name of their discretionary powers. Also starting from 1967 Governors have been using their
powers to dissolve or suspend State Legislative
Assemblies to help the ruling party at the centre
to form Governments at its convenience.
Such interferences by Governors in State
Government affairs and abuse of their powers
for partisan reason has been giving rise to a
feeling of insecurity among the States followed
by demands for settling the issues of appointment and dismissal of Governors themselves,
and a definite code for the exercise of discretionary powers by the governor.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Misuse of Article 356</i></strong></div>

It was a major issue of contention , as the
use of Act 356 was subjected to only the
subjective satisfaction of the president. However the situation was changed after the 49th
amendment act, which has introduced many
safeguards against misuse of the powers of the
President under article 356. The act has restored the original 6 months period when parliament extends it approval to the state emergency. the original constitution provided that
the state emergency could be extended for a
max. period of 3yrs. with parliamentary aproval,
without any preconditions, however the 44th
amendment has divided these 3yrs. into (1 yr.
normal period + 2yr. extra-ordinary period). If
it is to be extended beyond normal 1yr. then two
conditions are to be satisfied. 
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>There should be a national emergency
in force in whole of the country or the state
concerned.</li>
<li>The EC of India shall certify that under
the prevailing con dition a general election to
the state leg. assembly can not be held.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

 This situation was further improved in the
SR Bommai vs UOI 1994 case when the SC held
that the satisfaction of the President u/a 356 is subject to the judicial review, however the
judicial review would be limited to -

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Whether there was any mate rial on
which the President formed his satisfaction.</li>
<li>Whether the material was relevant.</li>
<li>Whether there was any malafide intension on the part of the President while
exer cising his power.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

All these provisions have by and large contributed positively towards restricting the misuse of Act 356 in the recent past and Art 356
no longer remains such an important issue of
the contention between the centre & states, as
it used to be earlier.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Article 200 & 201</i></strong></div>

The power of the Governor to reserve all bill,
passed by the legislature for the President's
assent is another cause of tension between the
Centre and the State. This has especially been
so in case where the Governor has reserved a
bill against the advice of the State Ministry,
presumably under the direction of the Central
Government. The main purpose of this provision is that the Centre wants to keep a watch
on the activities of the States. Unfortunately,
Governor has used these Articles in most of the
cases to serve the interest of the ruling party at
the Centre which led to a good deal of controversy The opposition ruled states have from
time to time raised a hue and cry against the
misuse of Article 200 and 201. The West Bengal
Government in its reply to the Sarkaria
Commission's questionnaire felt that Articles
200 and 201 had to be deleted. If the deletion
was not feasible, the State suggested that a
constitutional amendment should clarify that
the Governor would not act in his discretion but
only on the advice of the State Council of
Ministers. Further there is also a suggestion
about making such discretion of the Governor
subject to Judicial review.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Revenue</i></strong></div>

One of the most controversial areas between
the Centre and the State in a federal system is
that of financial relations and the Indian federal
system is no exception to this. The demand of
 the states for greater fiscal autonomy has now
become one of the most debated issues of the
Indian federation. The tension between Centre
and States with regard to fiscal relations arises
because of:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Comparative powers of taxation,</li>
        <li>Statutory versus discretionary grants, and</li>
        <li>Economic planning.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

(b) 
(c) 
Fiscal matters: Sources of revenue to the
Centre are relatively elastic and expansive as
against those of the states. The Centre also
controls vast resources generated through deficit financing, loans from organized money
market in the country as well as huge funds of
foreign aid. The residuary powers of taxation
are also vested with the Central Government.
In addition to this, Constitution also authorizes
the Centre to collect surcharges on taxes to raise
additional funds in times of emergency. In
practice surcharge has become a permanent
feature of income tax structure. Another loophole in taxation system, on account of which
states suffers, is the cooperate tax, which keeps
on expanding and is in the exclusive purview
of the Centre. The states therefore have to be
dependent on Central assistance.
<br>
Grants - in - Aid: With regard to sharing of
resources and assignment of certain resources
entirely to the State, Articles 280 and 281
provide for the appointment of an independent
Finance Commission every fifth year or earlier
as the President of India desires. The provision
of Finance Commission was to regulate, coordinate and integrate the finances of the Government of India and the State Government.
Originally, the Finance Commission was intended to cover all the financial transfers from
the Centre to States. However, slowly Planning
Commission has also been brought in for the
purpose and now it plays a rather important
part in devolution of resources from the Centre
to the States. Since the Planning Commission
is a completely Central institution the politically
influenced States have a sense of discrimination
in location of grants. States are sore not only
because of the fact that the Planning
Commission's authority to determine the scope
and pattern of a major portion of Central
assistance to States has relegated the role of 
Finance Commission to a subsidiary one but
also because the Centre does not seem to be
much serious even about the reduced role of the
Finance Commission. According to opposition
ruled state, provision for grants-in-aid by the
Centre has become purely a political and arbitrary means of devolution.
Centre gives grant-in-aid to States under
Article 281 on its discretion for undertaking
welfare schemes, meet natural calamities or for
removal of disparities etc. There is a general
feeling that Centre discriminated between States
being ruled by different political parties. A close
scrutiny of the Central relief to the States affected by natural calamities indicates that no
well considered norms were followed in this
regard. The Central teams preoccupied by
political considerations have always assessed
the damage done by droughts, flood, etc. in an
ad hoc perfunctory manner.
The States therefore, have sharply questioned the need for the Centre to wield heavy
financial clout in the shape of discretionary
grants, as there are inherent dangers of their
being used as a political weapon against a State
that happens to be out of favour with the
Centre. The States want more resources to be
ear-marked for statutory devolution so that the
trend of increasing allocations through discretionary grants can be curbed.
Economic Planning: It is generally agreed
that the process of planning in India has tended
to push the political system to greater
centralisation due to both the central control
over resources for development and the preponderance of the centralised planning machinery.
The gravest and most harmful consequence of
the atrophy of the state's domain in the economic field is in regard to industries and economic planning. Similarly it is alleged that in
the name of national planning, the centre for
political considerations has been inordinately
delaying viable and important state projects.
Infact the Centre has been alleged to be superimposing its schemes on the States which are
deemed by State governments to be irrelevant to
the conditions prevailing in the States.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Demand for Autonomy</i></strong></div>

The constituent units of the Indian Union i.e.
the States have been developing a feeling of
deprivation on the ground that the Centre has
denied them the autonomy that has been guaranteed under the Constitution. Moreover, despite changes in Government, the trend towards
centralization has not been weakend. In this
context the demand for a greater and more
meaningful devolution of power has been assertively and more stridently articulated over the
years. The Administrative Reforms Commission (appointed in 1967) recommended that
powers should be delegated to the maximum
extent to the States. It also expressed the
opinion that centralized planning had tended
towards excessive interference in the freedom of
States to work out their policies and programmes.
The Commission also made some recommendations with regard to the office of Governor and
also suggested the need to establish an InterState Council under Article 263 of the Constitution. The recommendations of the Commission however remained on paper and process of
centralization continued.

<h3>Sarkaria Commission</h3>

The decades of the eighties witnessed a
struggle to get the federal issue on the nation's
agenda. And when the political challenge
assumed new dimensions and tensions between
the Centre and the States grew in sharpness, it
became necessary to ease the situation. It was
in this context that the Government of India
announced on March 24, 1983 the appointment
of a Commission to examine and review the
working of existing arrangements between the
Union and the States in regard to powers,
functions and responsibilities in all spheres and
recommend appropriate changes and measures.
The Commission came to be known as the
Sarkaria Commission on Centre-State Relations
after the name of its Chairman R.S. Sarkaria.
The Commission was asked to keep in view the
social and economic developments that has
taken place over the years as also the scheme
and the framework of the Constitution and the
need for preserving the unity and integrity of
the country.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Report of Sarkaria Commission</i></strong></div>


The Sarkaria Commission in its report submitted on October 27, 1987. The Commission
favoured a strong Centre as the only safe-guard
to national integrity which was being threatened severely in the light of recent fissiparous
tendencies in the body politics. But, the Commission did not equate strong Centre with
centralisation of powers. Infact, it viewed
centralisation as dangerous for national integration. The Commission observes, those in power
at the centre, have been obliged to use diverse
strategies and tactics which were not always
sound from long term interests, to maintain
their control over state level forces. Many a
time, the actions of the centre, its discriminatory
approach towards some states, its lack of understanding of local problems, its object insensitiveness and the blatant misuse of authority
vis-à-vis the states have all distanced it from the
people. This, in turn, it is believed that reversed
the process of national integration, the divisive
tendencies have been further compounded by
such a short sighted approach.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recommendations of Sarkaria
Commission</i></strong></div>

Salient suggestions made by the Sarkaria
Commission are:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>More extensive and generous use of Article 258 which gives powers to Union
government to confer powers, etc. to State
governments should be made than as hitherto being done.</li>
        <li>Any move to disband the All India Service
or to permit the State government to opt
out the scheme must be regarded as retrograde and harmful to the larger interest of
the country. The All India Services should
be further strengthened and greater emphasis given on the role expected to be
played by them.</li>
        <li>Whenever the Union proposes to undertake
legislation with respect to a matter in the
Concurrent List, there should be prior consultation not only with the State government, individually, but also collectively. There
should be regular consultations on the management of All India Services between the
Union and the State governments.</li>
        <li>The Planning Commission and the National Development Council are to be reformed assuring at the same time of full
and effective consultation with the States
at all stages of the planning process so that
they feel that their role in it is not that of
a supplicant, but of an equal participant.</li>
        <li>Before the Union government deploys its
armed and other forces in a state in aid of
the civil power otherwise than on request
from the State government or declare an
area within a State as disturbed, it is
desirable that the State government should
be consulted, wherever feasible, and its
cooperation sought, even though prior
consultation with the State government is
not obligatory.</li>
        <li>Convention as to consultation with State
governments in Concurrent List individually as well as collectively should be strictly
adhered to except in extreme emergency.</li>
        <li>Governor should not, on demitting his
office, be eligible for any other appointment or office of profit under the Union or
State government.</li>
        <li>Article 356 (emergency provisions) should
be used very sparingly in extreme cases as
a measure of last resort when all available
alternatives fail.</li>
        <li>An expert committee should be constituted to enquire into and revive from time
to time in consultation with the States, the
operational feasibility of the scope for
levying taxes and duties under Article 269
and the complementary measures, the State
governments would be required to (Taxes
levied under this article are collected by
the Union Government and assigned to
the States).</li>
        <li>In order to ensure effective consultation
with the State Chief Minister, in the selection of a person to be appointed as Governor, the procedure of consultation should
be prescribed in the Constitution itself by
suitably amending it.</li>
        <li>Residuary powers of legislation in regard
to taxation matters should continue to
remain exclusively in the competence of
parliament while the residuary subjects
other than that of taxation should be
placed in the Concurrent List.</li>
        <li>Safeguards sho uld be incorporated in
Article 356 to enable Parliament to revive
continuance in force of a proclamation.</li>
        <li>The Constitution should be suitably
amended to add the subject of taxation of
'advertisement broadcast by radio or television to the present Entry 92, List (Union
list) and Article 269 (1) relating to duties
and taxes levied and collected by the
Union assigned to States.</li>
        <li>Inter State River Water Disputes Act may
be amended to make it mandatory on the
Union government to constitute a tribunal
within one year of receipt of an application from a State and should be amended
to empower the Union government to
appoint a tribunal when it is satisfied that
a case exists, to require States to furnish
necessary data to the tribunal, to make the
award of the tribunal effective within 5
years to give the award of the tribunal the
same sanction and force as that of a decree
of a Supreme Court.</li>
        
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Inter State Council</i></strong></div>


On top of this elaborate scheme of establishing cooperative Union State relations, was the
recommendation relating to the setting up of a
permanent Inter State Council under Article
263 of the Constitution to discuss many of the
problems of common Union-State interest.
Consisting of a General Body with Prime Minister as Chairman and all Union Cabinet Ministers and all Chief Ministers as members, and
Standing Committee with the Prime Minister as
chairman, Six Union Cabinet Ministers and Six
chief Ministers one from each zone as members,
such a Council is expected to provide a forum
for discussion in an era among senior statesmen.
The arrangement is expected to promote proper
understanding and mutual confidence among
the Chief Executive of the Union and the States.
In the light the recommendations of the
Sarkaria Commission, the Ministry of Home
Affairs issued an order dated 28th May, 1990
by which an Inter-State Council was established
under article 263 of the Constitution. The InterState Council consists of the Prime Ministers.
Chief Ministers of all States and Union territories with or without a Legislative Assembly and
six Ministers of Cabinet rank in the Union
Council of Ministers to be nominated by the
Prime Ministers or Ministers of State having
independent charge in the Union Government
when any item under their charge comes up for
discussion. The Prime Minister is the Chairman
of the Council.
The Inter-State Council is required to meet
atleast thrice every year. Its proceedings are to
be held in camera and decisions on all questions
are required to be taken by consensus. Decision
of the Chairman as to whether or not there is
a consensus is final.
<b>It is a recommendatory body with the
following duties:</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigating and discussing such subjects,
in which some or all of the States or the
Union and one or more of the States have
a common interest, as may be brought up
before it;</li>
<li>Making recommendations upon any such
subject and in particular recommendations
for the better coordination of policy and
action with respect to that subject; and</li>
<li>Deliberating upon such other matters of
general interest to the States as may be
referred by the Chairman to the Council.
Out-of-the-box suggestions to improve Centre-State Relations.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Amend Article 248 to provide the states with
powers to make any law with respect to any
matter not listed in the Union List or Concurrent List. That is, the residuary power on the
federation should lie both with the states as we
as the centre.</li>
<li>Amend Article 249 that gives power to
Parliament to legislate on the State List, by
the concurrence of the Rajya Sabha on a
matter deemed by it to be of national interest. This short circuits the amending process
laid down in Article 368, and unilaterally
transfers a subject from the State List to the
Concurrent List. A better and more equitable alternative is any how available in
Article 252 (1) even if it be cumbersome and
time consuming.</li>
<li>Amend Article 280 (regarding the Finance
Commission), and provide for the transfer of
seventy five per cent of the total revenue
raised by the Centre from all sources, to the
States.</li>
<li>Amend Article 3, to ensure that the name
and area of a State cannot be changed by
Parliament without the consent of the state
legislative concerned.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<h3>Punchhii Commission</h3> 

<b>The Punchhi Commission on Centre - State</b>
relation was constituted on April 28, 2007
by the UPA government, under the chairmanship of former Chief Justice of India
Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi, which submitted its report on April 20, 2010. The
Punchhi commission made very pertinent
observations regarding the qualifications,
appointment and removal of governors. As
for qualifications pertaining to governor, the
Punchhi Commission was forthright in suggesting that the nominee should not have
participated in active politics at even local
level for at least a couple of years prior to his
appointment.
Originally, it had four members: Justice
Punchhi (Chairman), former Home Secretaries Dhirendra Singh and V K Duggal, and
former Bangalore-based Law School Director Prof. N R Madhava Menon. Later, Dr.
Amaresh Bagchi, Professor Emeritus and
former Director of the National Institute of
Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) was also
made a member of the Commission.
The Commission for Centre-State Relations
headed by Justice Madan Mohan Punchhi has
submitted its report to the Central government
without much fanfare. This is a contradiction
to the Liberhan Commission Report which
was "full of sound and fury, signifying nothing" and which wasted 15 years.
A comprehensive review of Centre-State
Relations was undertaken by the Sarkaria
Commission in the mid-eighties. In the two
decades that have gone by both the polity
and economy have undergone profound
changes, posing new challenges for government at all levels and calling for a fresh look
at the relative roles and responsibilities of
each level and their inter-relations. The
present Commission has been entrusted with
this task and asked to make recommendations that would help to address the emerging challenges.
The major recommendations may be enumerated as follows
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>There should be an amendment in Articles
355 and 356 to enable the Centre to bring
specific trouble-torn areas under its rule for
a limited period.</li>
<li>The commission has proposed "localising
emergency provisions" under Articles 355
and 356, contending that localised areas -
either a district or parts of a district - be
brought under Governor's rule instead of the
whole state.Such an emergency provision
should however not be of duration of more
than three months.</li>
<li>The commission however supports their right
to give sanction for the prosecution of ministers 
against the advice of the state government.</li>
<li>To make an amendment in the communal
violence Bill to allow deployment of Central
forces without the state's consent for a short
period. It has proposed that state consent
should not become a hurdle in deployment
of central forces in a communal conflagration. However, such deployment should only
be for a week and post-facto consent should
be taken from the state.</li>    
<li>Among the significant suggestions made by
the Commission is, laying down of clear
guidelines for the appointment of chief ministers. Upholding the view that a pre-poll
alliance should be treated as one political
party, it lays down the order of precedence
that ought to be followed by the governor in
case of a hung house:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Call the group with the largest prepoll alliance commanding the largest number;</li>
        <li>the single largest party with support of
others;</li>
<li>the post-electoral coalition with all parties
joining the government; and last</li>
<li>the postelectoral alliance with some parties
joining the government and remaining including Independents supporting from outside.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The panel also feels that governors should
have the right to sanction prosecution of a
minister against the advice of the council of
ministers. However, it wants the convention
of making them chancellors of universities
done away with.</li>
<li>As for qualifications for a governor, the
Punchhi commission suggests that the nominee not have participated in active politics
at even local level for at least a couple of
years before his appointment. It also agrees
with the Sarkaria recommendation that a
governor be an eminent person and not
belongs to the state where he is to be posted.</li>
<li>The commission also criticises arbitrary dismissal of governors, saying, "the practice of
treating governors as political football must
stop". There should be critical changes in the
role of the governor - including fixed five
year tenure as well as their removal only
through impeachment by the state Assembly. It has also recommended that the state
chief minister have a say in the appointment
of governor.</li>
<li>Underlining that removal of a governor be
for a reason related to his discharge of
functions, it has proposed provisions for
impeachment by the state legislature along
the same lines as that of President by
Parliament.This, significantly, goes against
the doctrine of pleasure upheld by the recent
Supreme Court judgment.</li>
<li>Endorsing an NCRWC recommendation, it
says appointment of governor should be
entrusted to a committee comprising the
Prime Minister, Home Minister, Speaker of
the Lok Sabha and chief minister of the
concerned state. The Vice- President can
also be involved in the process.</li>
<li>Unlike the Sarkaria report, the Punchhi
report is categorical that a governor be given
fixed five-year tenure. The Punchhi Commission report also recommends that a constitutional amendment be brought about to
limit the scope of discretionary powers of the
governor under Article 163 (2). Governors
should not sit on decisions and must decide
matters within a four-month period.</li>
<li>The creation of an overriding structure to
maintain internal security along the lines of
the US Homeland Security department, giving more teeth to the National Integration
Council.</li>
<li>For the National Integration Council (NIC),
the commission has proposed that it should
meet at least once a year. In case of any
communal incident, it has said that a delegation of five members of the Council, who
would be eminent persons, should visit the
affected area within two days National debate
and submit a fact-finding report.</li>
<li>The commission, however, rejects a suggestion from some stakeholders as well as the
Liberhan Commission that the NIC be accorded constitutional status.</li>
<li> The commission has also studied new setups like the National Investigation Agency,
and recommended procedures to ensure
smooth co-operation of the states in terror
investigations entrusted to NIA. One can say
that the extreme politicization of the post of
Governor must be decried and certain specific 
norms for the appointment and removal have to be evolved.</li>
<li>The recent ruling of the Supreme Court has
indicated that the sanctity of this constitutional post should be preserved.
In democracy, nobody can have absolute
power in the name of smooth administration
and good governance. The administrative
apparatus has to be in the line of the constitution, which was prepared by the people
of the country and amended by the elected
representative of the people of India. The
'doctrine of pleasure' has to be understood
in this light.</li>
</ul>

</ol>


<h3>Finance Commission VS
Planning Commission</h3>

Indian Constitution has made an effort to
allocate every possible source of revenue either to
the Union or the states. For the purpose of
allocation of certain sources of revenue, between
the Union and the state Governments, the Constitution provides for the establishment of a
Finance Commission. On the other hand, the
Planning Commission is neither a constitutional
body nor a statutory body. Moreover, Planning
Commission does not have representation of
States. Mutual overlapping of these two bodies
is often a source of tensions in Centre - State
relations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Finance Commission</i></strong></div>

The Constitution of India contains the following provisions regarding the Finance Commission:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The President shall, within two years from
the commencement of this Constitution and
thereafter at the expiration of every fifth
year or at such earlier time as the President
considers necessary, by order constitute a
Finance Commission which shall consist of
a Chairman and four other members to be
appointed by the President.</li>
<li>Parliament may by law determine the qualifications which shall be requisite for appointment as members of the Commission and the
manner in which they shall be selected.</li>
<li>It shall be the duty of the Commission to
make recommendations to the President as
to-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The distribution between the Union and the
States of the net proceeds of taxes which are
to be, or may be, divided between them
under this Chapter and the allocation between the States of the respective shares of
such proceeds;</li>
<li>The principles which should govern the
grants-in-aid of the revenues of the States
out of the Consolidated Fund of India;</li>
<li>the measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement the 
resources of the Panchayats in the State on
the basis of the recommendations made by
the Finance Commission of the State;
</li>
<li>The measures needed to augment the Consolidated Fund of a State to supplement the
resources of the Municipalities in the State
on the basis of the recommendations made
by the Finance Commission of the State;</li>
<li>Any other matter referred to the Commission
by the President in the interests of sound
finance.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<li>The Commission shall determine their procedure and shall have such powers in the
performance of their functions as Parliament may by law confer on them.
Ever since the inauguration of the Constitution, Finance Commissions have been appointed
at regular intervals regarding sharing of revenues
between the Centre and the States. So far, thirteen
(13) such Commissions have been set up. One
notable feature of the Finance Commission has
been that the terms of reference have been made
wider and wider with each Finance Commission.
Even issues like debt burden of the state, financing
of relief expenditure and returns of public sector
undertakings have been placed under the purview of Finance Commissions. Further, the Union
Government has mostly accepted the recommendations of the Finance Commissions. Despite this
liberal attitude of the Union Government in financial matters, certain states have disapproved of the
existing arrangement for distribution of resources
and emphasizes that the distribution of resources
should be more progressive favoring the relatively
poorer states. So far the Union Government has
not shown preference for any particular settle and
has generally distributed the resources keeping in
view the principle that the limited resources of the
country should be deployed to attain best possible
results without generating tensions.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Planning Commission</i></strong></div>


The Planning Commission also plays a vital
role in the financial relations between the Centre and the States. Though the Planning Commission is an extra-constitutional body it plays
a leading role in deciding the outlays of the
plans of the States as well as the Centre. It also
decides how much money should be allotted to
the various states for expenditure on various
items. As the Planning Commission is headed
by the Prime Minister (who acts as its chairman)
and some of the important ministers of the
Union Cabinet are also associated with it, has
virtually become a handmade of the Central
Government. The National Development Council, which was created in 1952 as an adjunct to
the Planning Commission, to review the plans
also works more or less as an agency of the
Centre, even though the Chief Ministers of the
State are also its members. It has been alleged
that the Planning Commission plays more important role in the allocation of funds and grants to
the state than the Finance Commission.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Grants-in-aid</i></strong></div>

The Constitution also makes provision for
Grants -in- aid to the states out of the revenues
of the Centre. These grants are given by the
Parliament out of the Consolidated Fund of
India to such States which are in need of
assistance. The decision whether a State is in
need of assistance or not rests with the Parliament. Further different States may be granted
different sums. The Union Government also
pays to the states such capital and recurring
sums as may be necessary to enable that state
to meet the costs of such schemes of development as may be undertaken by the state with
the approval of the Government of India for the
purpose of promoting the welfare of the Scheduled Tribe in that State of raising the level of
administration of the Scheduled areas therein.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Controversy</i></strong></div>

It has been alleged by critics that the role
assigned to the Finance Commission has been
greatly undermined to the creation of the Planning Commission which has tended to play
increasing role in determining the transfer of
funds to the states. According to a study, more
funds were transferred to the states through the 
Planning Commission and the Finance Ministry
than the Finance Commission. Generally, the
Finance Commission is only required to plug the
non-development budgetary gaps in the finances
of the states only, while the plan outlays are
determined by the Planning Commission. Similarly the discretionary grants are also regulated
by the Finance Ministry and the Planning Commission and the Finance Commission hardly
play any role in this respect.
It is clear from the above discussion that the
states in India do not possess adequate finances and
have to look to the Union Government for assistance. The increasing dependence on the Union
Government inevitably results in the curtailment of
their autonomy, which poses a serious threat to the
existence of a federal structure. In view of the weak
position of the state, in the financial sphere, there
has been a growing demand for allocation of more
financial resources to the states so that they may be able to enjoy greater autonomy.
