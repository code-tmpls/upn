The Constitution of India was drawn up by a Constituent Assembly. The Assembly met for the first time 
on December 9, 1946. It was not a truly representative body as its members were indirectly elected by 
those who were themselves elected on a narrow franchise. The Assembly constituted a Drafting Committee, 
under the chairmanship of Dr.B.R.Ambedkar, to frame a constitution for India. Indian Constitution was 
adopted on November 26, 1949 and it came into effect on January 26, 1950.  It is the longest written 
Constitution in the world containing 395 Articles, 22 Parts and 12 Schedules. During 60 years of its 
existence, Indian Constitution has undergone several amendments and demand to review it completely has 
also been raised. But, inspite of all these changes, the "basic structure" of constitution remain 
intact.<br>


<h3>Development of the Indian Constitution</h3><br>
British rule in India ended on 15th August 1947 and India emerged as an independent and sovereign 
republic. Certain features of Indian Polity or Constitution can be understood better.<br>

with a brief review of the constitutional set up in the preceding periods. As modern political 
institutions originated and developed in India mainly during the British rule, the origin and 
growth of the Indian Constitution has its roots in the British period of Indian history. 
The British came to India in the 17th century as traders. From 1773 onwards, various Acts were 
passed by the British Government for the governance of India.

<h3>Sources of Indian Constitution</h3><br/>
The sources of Indian Constitution include the imaginative aspirations of the nationalist leaders, the 
actual working of the Government of India Act, 1935, and the experience gained from the actual working 
of some of the Constitutions of important countries of the world. Moreover, its sources include not only 
the sources upon which the founding fathers of our Constitution drew but also the developmental sources 
such as the judicial decisions, constitutional amendments, constitutional practices and so on.<br/><br/>
The sources of the Indian Constitution can thus be divided into the following two categories:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constituent Assembly Debates:</i></strong></div>
Constituent Assembly was constituted under the Cabinet Mission plan to frame the Indian Constitution. 
Its members included distinguished lawyers, intellectuals and patriots who took two years, eleven months 
and eighteen days to prepare the constitution. During the course of this period, debates on all the aspects 
of the Constitution were held in a free and fair manner. These debates produced an intelligent opinion in 
the light of which every word of the Constitution was screened carefully and intelligently.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reports of Committees of the Constituent Assembly:</i></strong></div>
The Constituent Assembly appointed various types of committees to make reports on different aspects. 
Some of the most important committees  included Union Powers Committees, Union Constitution Committee,
Provincial Constitution Committee, etc.  Advisory Committed on the rights of citizens, minorities and tribal 
and excluded areas and hoc Committee regarding the Supreme Court Committee on financial relations between the
 Union and States. The reports of these committees were thoroughly discussed in the Drafting Committee. It 
 was on the basis of the reports made by such committees that the draft of the Constitution was prepared.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nehru Report:</i></strong></div>

The british Government had announced the formation of the Simon Commision for making a report on the working
 of the Government of India Act, 1919 and suggest constitutional measures required for the efficient 
 administration of Indian. The Congress decided to boycott this Commision because no Indian was taken on it. 
 Instead it announced the formation of a committee under the leadership of Motilal Nehru  to make 
 recommendations about the desired constitutional set up for India. The Committee made certain recommendations
  which are known as the Nehru Report. The main Clauses of this Report were : 
 <ul>
<li>grant of Empire;</li>
<li>Creation of a federal structure for India </li> 
<li>bicameralism at the Centre;</li>   
<li>Parliamentary and responsible Government in Provinces;</li>  
<li>guarantee of Fundamental Right;</li>
<li>establishment of Supreme Court as the final court of appeal.</li>
 </ul>
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lahore Session of the Congress:</i></strong></div>

The Congress at its Lahore session held in 1929 resolved to make India a Republic.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Objectives Resolution:</i></strong></div>

Jawharlal Lal Nehru moved in the Constituent Assembly the Objectives Resolution embodying the aspirations 
of nationalist India. The Objectives Resolution clearly spelled out making India a sovereign republic where 
the ultimate supreme power should be vested with the people. It stated that the people would get social, 
economic and political justice, liberties of all types and equality. Upliftment of the backward people and 
areas would be ensured and the structure of the country would be federal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Government of India Act 1935:</i></strong></div>

 At the time the Constitution for free India was being framed, India was governed by the Government of India 
 Act, 1935. The fathers of the Indian Constitution drew heavily on the experience and the provisions of this 
 Act. According to Jennings - "The Constitution derives directly from the Government of India Act, 1935 from 
 which, in fact, many of its provision are copied textually."

 <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of Various Constitutions:</i></strong></div>
 
 The founding fathers of the Indian Constitution were wise enough to borrow from the experience gained in 
 the working of various other Constitutions. It is on this account that the Constitution of India is 
 regarded as a bag of borrowing from the various working Constitutions 

<ul>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>British Constitution:</i></strong></div>

<br>

<li><b>Development Sources</b>
Indian Constitution is not a static doument. It has growmn with the changing needs. Thus amendments, judicial 
decisions, political practices, Parliamentary status, rules, regulations and ordinances are the developmental
sources of the Constitution.
<ul>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Amendments of the Constitution:</i></strong></div>
    During the
course of 60 years the Constitution has been amended about 94 times and a few other amendments are in the 
pipeline. In this way, the present shape of the Constitution is quite different from the original document. 
The 42nd Amendment made it clear that the Indian Constitution is more flexible than rigid. This Amendment is 
often termed as 'the mini Constitution of India' due to enormous changes it
effected to the Indian Constitution.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Decisions:</i></strong></div>
     The judicial decisions
given by the Supreme Court on important issues
have added new dimensions to the Constitution. It is in the light of such decisions that
further constitutional amendments are made in
the Constitution. Some of the most important
judicial decisions are:
<ul>
    <li>Gopalan vs. State of Madras;</li>
    <li>State of Madras vs. Champakam;</li>
    <li>Golak Nath vs. State of Punjab;</li>
    <li>Keshavanand Bharti vs. Kerala State</li>
</ul>

    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliamentary Statutes:</i></strong></div>
     Parliament has also
made various statues for furnishing details of the
various Articles contained in the Constitution. It
is the Constitution which itself empowers the
Parliament to enact laws on certain Articles for
details. These statues are considered as constitutional laws. Without their existence, a detailed
study of the Constitution is not possible.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commentaries of Constitutional Experts:</i></strong></div>
    While interpreting the Constitution, the views
of the distinguished constitutional experts,
whether Indian or foreign, enjoy special importance. The most notable constitutional experts
are Jennings, Gledhill, Alexandrowit, D.D. Basu,
Palkhiwala, V.N. Shukla, etc. Their views are
not given legal recognition but due regard is
paid to them by the judges. Moreover, true
significance of any provision of the Constitution
can be understood in the light of their views.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rules, Regulations, Ordinances, etc.:</i></strong></div>
     Each House of the Parliament is empowered to make
rules for its efficient working. The President has also
got the right to make rules for fixing the constitutional subjects. President of India is also empowered to 
make rules with respect to the condition of services of the members of the Union Public Service
Commission. He can also frame rules to establish peace and efficient administration of the Union Territories.
Above all, the President has also the power to issue ordinances when Parliament is not in session. All these 
rules, regulations and ordinances serve as sources of the Constitution.
    </li>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Practices :</i></strong></div>
    Although the Constitution of India is the most detailed in the world, still certain practices 
    independent of the Constitution have developed in India.
    A few examples of such a practice can be enumerated as follows.
    <ul>
        <li>The Central Government takes before hand the advice of the State Government in the appointment 
            of its Governer.</li>
        <li>Governer can be recalled by the Central Government on the advice of the State Government concerned.</li>
        <li>Governer should not belong to the state to which he is appointed.</li>
        <li>One of the judges of the Supreme Court must belong to the minority community.</li>
        <li>The senior most judge of the Supreme Court should be appointed as the Chief Justice of India.</li>
        <li>The leader of the majority party in Lok sabha is appointed as the Prime Minister.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>Nature and Features Of Indian
Constitution</h3>
Every constitution aims to build up a governmental structure based upon certain basic
principles. And these principles are more or less
well established. Although some of these principles are common to most constitution, there
are others which vary from constitution to
constitution. The constitution of India is not an
exception to this rule and it has its own basic
principles. India, a union of states, is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic, republic.
The constitution of a country is the basic or
supreme law. Indian constitution is federal in
structure but with unitary features. It is a
lengthy and legalistic document, but reasonably
flexible. Its major features include.
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Popular Sovereignty</i></strong></div>

Indian Constitution proclaims the sovereignty
of the people in its Preamble itself. The idea is
reaffirmed in several places in the Constitution,
particularly in the chapter dealing with elections.
Article 326 declares that "the elections to the House
of people and the Legislative Assembly of every
state shall be on the basis of adult suffrage". As a
result, the Governments at the Centre and in the
States derive their authority from the people who
choose their representatives for Parliament and the
State Legislatures at regular intervals. Further,
those who wield the executive power of the government are responsible to the legislature and
through them to the people. Thus, in the affairs of
the State, it is the will of the people that prevails
ultimately and not the will of a few individuals.
This is the principle of popular sovereignty.
<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rule of Law</i></strong></div>

According to this axiom, people are ruled by
law but not by men, that is, the basic truism that
no man is infallible. The axiom is vital to
democracy. More important is the inherent
meaning that the 'law' is the sovereign in democracy. The chief ingredient of law is custom 
which is nothing., but the habitual practices and beliefs of common people over long years.
In the final analysis, rule of law means the sovereignty
of the common man's collective wisdom. Apart
from this crucial meaning, rule of law means a
few more things like
(a) there is no room for arbitrariness;
(b) each individual enjoys some fundamental
rights; and
(c) the highest judiciary is the final authority in
maintaining the sanctity of the law of the land.
It is this spirit that make Article 14 (all are
equal before law and all enjoy equal protection of
laws) meaningful, like providing legal assistance
to the needy, promotion of Lok Adalats and the venture of the Supreme court known as 
"public interest litigation". Also, as per today's law of the land, any litigant can 
appeal to the presiding judicial authority to argue the case by himself or seek legal 
assistance with the help of judiciary.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Review</i></strong></div>
The right of the judiciary to review executive acts and legal enactments when they are not 
in conformity with the established law of the land and its procedures is known as judicial 
review.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialism</i></strong></div>
Increasing intervention as well as participation by the State in the economic field has been
a distinguishing feature of the twentieth century. There is hardly any country today in
which the State is not actively engaged in a
variety of economic activities. In varying degrees, governments everywhere are involved in
economic, industrial, commercial management.
This is broadly described as the influence of
socialist ideas on State activity. Even before the
adoption of a new Constitution, the Government of independent India had made clear its
policy to enter the economic field in a very
active manner. The Industrial Policy Resolution
of 1948 gives ample evidence of this. It envisaged a greater role for the State in the economic
development of the country. Certain industries
such as atomic energy, manufacturing of arms
and ammunition were declared to be the sole
monopoly of the State. The right of the State to
nationalise any major industry and bring it
within the public sector was also clearly stated.
The Directive Principles of State Policy, however, unmistakably set out the socialist objective
of the Constitution; although one might point
out that they do not go far enough to establish
a full fledged socialist order.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialism in Constitutional Amendments</i></strong></div>
Successive amendments to the Constitution
of India clearly show that the direction is more
towards the realisation of socialist than the
democratic ideal. The constitution was amended
several times with a view to realising this
objective. Among those amendments, special
mention may be made of the First, Fourth,
Seventeenth, Twenty fifth, Twenty ninth, Thirty
fourth and Forty second Amendments. Almost
all of these gave precedent to the Directive
Principles over Fundamental Rights in the implementation of certain legislative enactments. The
Forty second Amendment (1976) went a step
further and amended the permeable of the Constitution to include specifically the term "socialist"
which was absent in the original form in which it was enacted.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE FEATURES OF A SECULAR
    DEMOCRACY?
</i></strong></div>
The distinguishing features of a secular democracy
as contemplated by the Constitution of India are:
<ol>
<ul>
    <li>
    The State will not identify itself with or be controlled by any religion
    </li>
    <li>
    While the State guarantees to everyone the right to
profess whatever religion one chooses to follow (which
includes also the right to be an antagonist or an atheist),
it will not accord an preferential treatment to any of them
    </li>
    <li>
    No discrimination will be shown by the State
against any person on account of his religion or faith
    </li>
    <li>
    The right of every citizen, subject to any general
condition, to enter any office under the state will be
equal to that of the fellow citizens. Political equality
which entitles any Indian citizen to seek the highest
office under the State is the heart and soul of secularism as envisaged by Constitution.
    </li>
</ul>
</ol>

</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Securalism</i></strong></div>

Indian Constitution aims to establish a secular state. This does not mean that the State in
India is anti-religious. India has declared its
identity as a "Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic, Republic." The attributes of Socialist and
Secular were added in 1976 by the 42nd Amendment to the Constitution. The bulky document
does not attempt to define secularism. However,
a definition is derived from the fundamental
right that proclaims that "The State shall not
discriminate against any citizen on grounds of
religion, race, caste, sex place of birth or any one
of them.' The Indian State has no religion of its
own. The fundamental right of speech and
freedom also means the right to preaching and proselytising religion. This is 
made clearer in
Articles 25-28, "Subject to public order, mortality and health... all persons are equally entitled
to freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practice and propagate religion". Every
religious denomination or any section thereof
shall have the right to establish and maintain
institutions for religious and charitable purposes, to maintain its own affairs in matters of
religion. No person shall be compelled to pay
any taxes for promotion of any particular religion. No religious instructions shall be provided
in any educational institutions wholly  maintained out of the State funds.

<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HOW THE CONSTITUTION ENSURES
    INDEPENDENCE OF THE JUDICIARY?
</i></strong></div>
In its bid to establish complete independence of the
judiciary, the Indian Constitution has first erected a wall
of separation between the executive and the judiciary.
After effecting such separation, it has created conditions
that are conducive to making the judiciary independent.
Thus, rigid qualifications are laid down for the appointment of Judges and provision has been made for compulsory consultation of the Chief justice of India in the
appointment of every judge of the Supreme Court and
the High Courts. Conditions of service of a Judge cannot be altered to his/her disadvantage, 
once he/she is appointed. Judges are given high salaries and their conduct is made a subject beyond
the scope of discussion in the legislature. They cn be removed from the office only for proved 
misbehaviour. For this purpose, both the houses of parliament will have to pass resolutions 
aganist the judges supported by a two third majority of those who sit and vote and atleast an 
absolute majority of the total membership of the house. 

</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial Independence</i></strong></div>
The framers of Indian Constitution were
aware that democratic freedom was meaningless in the absence of an independent machinery
to safeguard it. No subordinate or agent of the government could be trusted to be just and
impartial in judging the merits of a conflict in
which the government itself was a party. Similarly, a judiciary, subordinate either to the Center
or the State could not be trusted as an impartial
arbiter of conflicts and controversies between the
Center and the State. These were compelling
reasons for the creation of an independent judiciary as an integral part of the Constitution and
for the adoption of judicial independence as a
basic principle of the Constitution.

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHY THE FRAMERS OF INDIAN CONSTITUTION
CHOSE 'FEDERALISM'?</i></strong></div>

The framers of Indian Constitution turned to federalism as a solution of a number of problems they
confronted in their attempt to frame a constitution of a
new united India. Particularly, they wanted to preserve
both the "infinite variety and the innate unity" that animated the length and breadth of India. The choice of
federalism as a constitutional form and as the basis
of a national government in India was not a sudden
development upon the transfer of power on 15th August, 1947. It was there for many years and, in a limited form, it was already in operation in British India.
For the resolution of the constitutional problem of a
multi-racial, multi-lingual and multi-communal country
like India with a vast area and a huge population, federalism was only a natural choice. Nevertheless, the
framers were cautious to ensure that the unity they
sought to establish through federalism was of an abiding nature and in case of a future conflict between
that unity and the diversity preserved under the Constitution; the former should prevail over the other. In
other words, it was their intention to create an indestructible Union and the supremacy of the Union over
the states in a number of matters vitally affecting the
interest of the nation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Federalism</i></strong></div>
Federalism is one of the most important
aspects of modern constitutions. It is established
all over the world perhaps, as the only form of
political organization suited to communities with
a diversified pattern of objectives, interests and
traditions, who seek to join together in the
pursuit of common objectives and interests and
the cultivation of common traditions. The basic
objective of federalism is thus unity in diversity,
devolution in authority and decentralisation in
administration. Its fundamental characteristic is
the division of powers between two sets of Governments- a Central Government and State 
Government- each independent of the other in its own sphere of activity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Federal vs. Unitary Features</i></strong></div>
India has two governments functioning at
the national and state levels with a clear cut
distribution of powers. Both the State and the
Union Government, draw their authority from
the Constitution. The supremacy of the Republic lies not with either the Union Government or
the State Governments but with the Constitution. To uphold the legal supremacy of the
Constitution, the power to interpret the constitution has been vested in the judiciary. Thus, the
Indian Constitution has four federal features:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>clear division of powers between the two governments;</li>
        <li>dual system of government</li>
        <li>supremacy of the Constitution;</li>
        <li>authority of the judiciary to interpret the Constitution.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The word 'federation' not been used
anywhere in the Constitution. In fact, India has
been described as a Union of States. The provinces and the princely States were not sovereign
entities before they joined the federation. The
states are not 'inviolable' or 'indestructible' as in
the USA. Parliament can by law change or alter
the areas and boundaries of any State. No state
has the right to secede from the Union. All the
constituent States of the Union are not equal.
The Union Territories do not enjoy the same
status as the States. Unlike the American Constitution, the Indian Constitution does not provide for any safeguards for the protection of the
rights of States. Except Jammu & Kashmir, no
state has its own Constitution as in the U.S.
Whereas the consent of the States is vital for an
amendment of the American Constitution, the
consent of the States in India is necessary only
in regard to a few specific matters.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WHAT ARE THE 'UNITARY' FEATURES OF
INDIAN CONSTITUTION?</i></strong></div>
There are some unitary features in Indian Constitution. They may be enlisted as below:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Parliamentary Government</i></strong></div>

The framers of our Constitution preferred
parliamentary system of government. Our infant
democracy could ill-afford any confrontation
between executive and the legislature if they
were separate and independent of each other.
The President of India is the constitutional head
of the Union Executive, but he exercises the
executive power, vested in him, in accordance
with the advice of the Union Council of Ministers. The real executive power thus vests with the
Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister as
the head. The Council of ministers is collectively
responsible to the Lok Sabha. The same is true of
the relationship between the Governors and the
Council of Ministers in the States. The parliamentary system of government both at the Centre
and in the State is based on adult suffrage
whereby all citizens of India who are not less
than 18 years of age and not otherwise disqualified by the Constitution or any law, have the
right to vote. It is a bold political experiment in
view of the vastness of the country, its large
population, poverty and illiteracy. Though some
current practices have vitiated the process of
election, adult franchise has not shaped people's
political perceptions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Why the Indian Constitution is lengthy?</i></strong></div>

It is the most lengthy and legalistic constitutional document any country has so far adopted.
One reason is that the Constitution has drawn
from a variety of sources. The other is that the
constitution-makers ensured that no element of
uncertainty was left. It codifies in detail the
relationship between the Union and the States
and the State's interests and contains both justiciable and non-justiciable rights as well as fundamental duties. As the Constitution is not only
a legal document, but an instrument of social
change, it has to be a detailed document in order to ensure that it stands the test of any 
situation in future. Also, care has been taken to ensure that the Constitution is not subverted 
or preverted by any future government, thus, there are numerous in-built constitutional safeguards.
 Another reason for the length of the Constitution is that, there are temporary, transitional 
 and special provisions for the state of Jammu and Kashmir and it also take care of regional 
 problems in states like Gujarat, Maharastra, Andhra pradesh, Sikkim, Assam, Nagaland and 
 Manipur. The legalistic nature of the Constitution is also partly because of heavy borrowings 
 from the Government of India Act of 1935.
 
 <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rigidity vs. Flexibility</i></strong></div>

Some eminent constitutionalists are of the
view that the Indian constitution is rigid. But,
then how it has been possible to amend the
constitution over 90 times. Indian constitution
is more flexible than the American constitution,
which requires ratification of amendments by
three-fourths of the States. In Indian constitution, only amending of a few provisions requires
ratification of amendments by three fourths of
the states. In our constitution only amending of
a few provisions requires ratification by half of
the State Legislatures. While most of the provisions
of the Constitution can be amended by two thirds majority of each of the Houses of Parliament 
and many of the provisions can be altered or modified by a simple majority. Also, the 
constitution can be supplemented by simple legislations like the Citizenship Act, National 
Security Act and the Untouchability Act etc. Moreover, the scope for the growth of conventions 
to supplement the Constitution makes it more flexible. Conventions govern the privileges and rights 
of the legislature, the functioning of the cabinet system, the status of the Cabinet Secretariat,
etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Single Citizenship</i></strong></div>

In a federation there is usually double citizenship. A citizen belongs to the State in which he
is born and also enjoys the citizenship rights of the
federation, to which his state has joined as a unit.
This is one of the basic principles of federalism,
that the states in a federation are units of federation, but do not give up their individual entity. But
in India, there is single citizenship. Citizens belong
to the Indian Union and not to any state. Provision
for single citizenship for the whole of India was
perhaps intentional. The constitution fathers did
not like that regionalism and other disintegrating
tendencies which had already raised their ugly
heads and were endangering the very security
and integrity of country, should be further encouraged by providing double citizenship. Provision
for double citizenship would have naturally stood
on the way of emotional and national integration.
The people in the State would have thought more
in terms of the State than the country as a whole.
Single citizenship has undoubtedly forged a sense
of unity among the people of India and image of
United India is reflected by this provision.
