    there would be two independent Dominions to be known as "India" and Pakistan", and the Constituent 
    Assembly of each Dominion would have unlimited powers to frame and adopt any Constitution, and to repeal 
    any Act of the British Parliament."

    <h3>Framing Of Indian Constitution</h3>
    It was under the Cabinet Mission Plan of
1946 that the Constituent Assembly was constituted to frame a Constitution for India. The
Constituent Assembly, which had been elected for undivided India and held its first sitting on
Dec. 9, 1946, reassembled on Aug. 14, 1947, as
the sovereign Constituent Assembly for the Dominion of India. As a result of the partition under the Plan of 
June 3, 1947,

<div class="subheading"><strong>How The Constituent Assembly Of India was Constituted?</strong></div>

The Constituent Assembly of India was elected
through indirect election by the members of the Provincial Legislative Assembly (Lower House only), according
to the scheme recommended by the Cabinet Delegation. The essentials of this scheme were as follows:
<ul>
    <li>The Provinces elected 292 members; 
        while the Indian States were allotted a maximum of 93 seats.</li>
    <li>The seats in each province were distributed among
the three main committees Muslim, Sikh, and General, in proportion to their respective 
population.</li>
    <li> Members of each community in the Provincial Legislative Assembly elected their own 
        representatives
by the method of proportional representation with
single transferable vote.</li>
    <li>The method of selection in the case of representatives
of Indian States was to be determined by nomination.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="subheading"><strong>Acceptance of the Constitution:</strong></div>
 On Aug.
29, 1947, the Constituent Assembly appointed
a Drafting Committee under the chairmanship
of Dr. Ambedkar. This committee came out
with a draft Constitution of India in Feb. 1948.
The Constituent Assembly next met in Nov.
1948 to consider the provisions of the Draft
Committee, clause by clause. The second reading of the clauses was completed by Oct. 17,
1949, and the third reading on Nov. 26, 1949,
when the Constitution received the signature
of the President of the Assembly and was
declared as passed. While certain provisions of
the constitution - those relating to citizenship,
elections, provisional Parliament, etc. were
given immediate effect, the rest of the Constitution came into force on Jan. 26, 1950 
because the Congress had been celebrating Independence Day on January 26 every year since
1930. The Constituent Assembly itself became
the first provisional parliament. The first elections to parliament were held in 1952

<h3>Philosophy Of Indian
Constitution</h3>
On January 22, 1947 the Constituent Assembly adopted the Objectives Resolution drafted
by Jawaharlal Nehru. The Objective Resolution
contained the fundamental propositions of the
Constitution and set forth the political ideas
that should guide its deliberations. The main
principles of the resolution were:
<ul>
    <li>India is to be an Independent, sovereign republic.</li>
    <li>It is to be a democratic union with an equal level of self-government in 
        all the Constituent parts;
    </li>
    <li>All power and the authority of the Union Government and governments of the 
        Constituent parts is derived from the people. 
    </li>
    <li>The Constitution must strive to obtain and guarantee to the people justice based upon 
        social, economic and political equality of opportunity and equality before law; 
    </li>
    <li>There should be freedom of thought, expression, belief, faith, worship, vocation, 
        association and action;</li>
    <li>The Constitution must provide just rights for minorities and people from backward 
        and tribal areas, etc. so that they can be equal participants of social, economic 
        and political justice.</li>
    <li>The Constitution should secure for India, a
due place in the community of nations.
The philosophy of a Constitution consists of
the ideals for which the constitution stands and the policies which the Constitution enjoins upon
the rulers of the Community to follow. The
Constitution of India reflects the impact of our
ideology in the following spheres:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <div class="subheading"><strong>Democracy:</strong></div>
         We have borrowed the modern
form of democracy from the West. Under
this system, democracy means the periodic
responsibilities of the Government to go to the people. FOr this purpose; elections
have been held every five-year to elect a Government by the people. However, democracy
covers even the economic and social aspects of life. This aspect of democracy is well
reflected in the Directive Principles of State Policy. They are aimed at human welfare, 
co-operation, international brotherhood and so on.</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Secularism:</strong></div>
Secularism is the hallmark of the Indian Constitution. People professing different religions 
have the freedom of religioud worship of their own choice. All the religious have been treated
alike. The fact appreciated in India was that all religions love humanity and uphold truth.
All the social reformers and political leaders of modern Indian have advocated religious 
tolerance, religious freedom and equal respect for all the religions. The very principle has 
been adopted in the constitution of India where all religions enjoy equal respect. However, the 
word  'secularism' was nowhere mentioned in the Constitution as adopted in
1949. The word 'secularism' has now been
added to the Preamble to the Constitution
through the 42nd Amendment passed in
1976.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Socialism:</strong></div>
 Socialism is not new to India.
Vedanta philosophy has socialism in it. The
national struggle for freedom had this aim
also in view. Jawaharlal Nehru referred to
himself as a socialist and republican. Almost
all the parties in India profess to promote
democratic socialism. These principles are
included in the Directive Principles of State
Policy. However, to lay emphasis on this
aspect, the word 'socialism' was specifically
added to the Preamble to the Constitution
through the 42nd Amendment.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Socialism:</strong></div>
Decentralization: India has always practised decentralisation through the
Panchayat system. Mahatma Gandhi also advocated decentralisation. It is on this
account that he is regarded as a philosophical anarchist. We have introduced
the Panchayati Raj system in India to
achieve the objective of decentralisation.
The concept of cottage industries as laid
down in the Directive Principles of State
Policy also refers to decentralisation.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Mixed Economy:</strong></div>
 Co-existence is a salient
feature of our ideology. Co-existence has
manifested itself through a mixed system
of economy. In this system we have allowed both the private and public sectors
of economy to work simultaneously. Large
scale and essential industries have been
put in the public sector.
</li> 
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Humanism:</strong></div>
 Humanism is a salient feature
of Indian ideology. Indian ideology regards
the whole humanity as one big family. It
believes in resolving international disputes
through mutual negotiations. This is what
we find in the Directive Principles of State
Policy. 
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Spiritualism:</strong></div>
 Spiritualism refers to what
inspires and promotes the people to be
their best selves. It creates a feeling of
sacrifice, peace, non-violence, tolerance and
cooperation. It is basic feature of Indian philosophy. We have tried to achieve this through
equality in all spheres of life. This leads to social welfare.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Liberalism:</strong></div>
Liberalism does not refer to the western concept of liberalism. It refers, in the Indian context,
to self government, secularism, nationalism, economic reforms, constitutional approach, and
representative institutions etc. all these concepts were advocated by the modern Indian Leaders.\
All these elements have been incorporated in the Indian Constitution by the virtue of which we 
want to establish a Welfare State in India. Everything has to be achieved through constitutional
means.</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Sarvodaya:</strong></div>
Sarvodaya refers to the welfare of all. It is different from the welfare pf the majority. 
It seeks to achieve the welfare of all without exception.  It is
referred to as Ram Rajya. The concept of
Sarvodaya was developed by Mahatma
Gandhi, Acharya Vinoba Bhave and J..
Narayan under which the material, spiritual, moral and mental developement of  everyone is 
sought to be achieved. The Preamble to the Indian Constitution and
the Directive Principles of State Policy represent this idea.
</li>
<li>
<div class="subheading"><strong>Gandhism:</strong></div>
Gandhism represents an ethical and moral India. Gandhi set a new example of fighting foreign 
rule through non-violence. He taught the importance of non-violence and truth. He advocated
untouchability, cottage industry, prohibition, adult education and the uplift of villages. 
He wanted a society free of exploitation and decentralised in character. All these Gadhian 
principles have found an honourable place in the Constitution of India.
</li>
</ul>
</ol>

<div class="list-group">
<div class="list-group-item bg-box mtop15p">
<div class="subheading"><strong>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 'INDIAN'
    AND 'AMERICAN' JUDICIAL REVIEW?
</strong></div>
Based on the principle of Judicial Review, the American Supreme Court has acquired the 
power to so interpret the Constitution that it has come to be known as the third chamber of 
the Constitution, whereas, in India the Supreme Court does not enjoy the power of adding to 
the Constitution but it can only strike down any act or any legislation on the ground that
it is contrary to the basic framework of the Constitution or violative of the procedure 
established by law.
<br>
As the Indian Constitution stands today, the judiciary in India has the right to review 
legislative enactments and executive acta provided they are brought before the courts except 
for a few specific acts like the discretionary powers of the Governers, the privileges and
immunities of the members of the legislatures, etc. In pronouncing its verdict on legislative
acts and executive actions the Supreme Court primarily bases itself on what is known as the 
basic framework of the Constitution-a phrase which has never been spelt out so that others could
know the ingredients that go into the making of the basic frame work of the Constitution.
However, it is clear from the constitution as it is today
that the Parliament has the right to amend the constitution as long as it does not erode the basic frame work
of the constitution. Thus, making additions or deleting
some Articles of the constitution is the power of the
Parliament but not that of the Supreme Court as in the
case of the U.S.
