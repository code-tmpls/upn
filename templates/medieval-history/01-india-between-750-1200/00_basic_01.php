<h3>India Between
750-1200 AD</h3>


The period between AD 750 and AD 1200
is referred to as an early medieval period of
Indian History. It was earlier treated by
historians as a 'dark phase'. It was so because
during this time the whole country was divided
into numerous regional states which were busy
fighting with each other. But recent studies have
indicated that, though politically divided, India
witnessed a growth of new and rich cultural
activities in the fields of art, literature and
language. In fact, some best specimens of temple
architecture and Indian literature belong to this
period. Thus, far from being 'dark' it may be
treated as a bright and vibrant phase of Indian
history.
<br>
<br>
The political developments after
Harshavardhan, can be best understood if we
divide the period from AD 750 to AD 1200 in
two parts (a) AD 750-AD 1000; (b) AD 1000-
AD 1200. The first phase was marked by the
growth of three important political powers in
India. These were Gurjara Pratiharas in north
India, Palas in eastern India and Rashtrakutas
in South India. These powers were constantly
fighting with each other with an aim to set up
their control on Gangetic region in northern
India. This armed conflict among these three
powers is known as ‘Tripartite struggle’. In the
second phase we notice the breakup of these
powers. It resulted in the rise of many smaller
kingdoms all over the country. For example, in
northern India, the disintegration of the
Pratihara Empire brought to the forefront
various Rajput states under the control of
different Rajput dynasties such as the
Chahmanas (Chauhans), Chandellas,
Paramaras. etc. These were the states which
fought and resisted the Turkish attacks from
northwest India led by Mahmud Ghaznavi and
Mohammad Ghori in the 11th and 12th
centuries, but had to yield ultimately as they
failed to stand united against the invaders.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAJOR DYNASTIES</i></strong></div>

The Pallava dynasty emerged in South India
at a time when the Satavhana dynasty was on
the decline, Shivaskandavarman is said to have
been the founder of the Pallava dynasty. During
their reign, the Pallava rulers made Kanchi their
capital and extended the kingdom from the
Krishna in the south to a region further north of
the Arabian Sea. The chronology of the Pallava
kings is vague, but texts suggest that they were
most powerful between 330 and 550. The
noteworthy rulers during this period were:
Simhavarama I, Sivaskkandavarma I,
Veerakurcha, Shandavarma II, Kumaravishnu
I, Simhavarma II, and Vishnugopa. Vishugopa
is said to have been defeated in battle by
Samudragupta after which the Pallavas become
weaker and the Cholas and the Kalahari
repeatedly attacked their kingdom and robbed
it of its wealth and territories. It was
Simhavishnu, the son of Simhavarma II, who
eventually crushed the Kalabhras’ dominance in
575 and re-established his kingdom. There also
seems have been an enmity between the Pallava
and Pandya kingdoms. However, the real
struggle for political domination was between
the Pallava and Chalukya realms. The Pallava
history between 600 and 900 is full of accounts
of wars between the Pallava and the
Chaluakaya rulers.
<br>
<br>
In 670, Parameshwaravarma I came to the
throne and restricted the advance of the
Chlukyan king Vikramaditya I. However, the
Chalukyas joined hands with the Pandya king
Arikesari Maravarma, another promients enemy
of the Pallavas, and defeated Parameshwaravarma I. Parameshwaravarma I died in 695 and
was succeeded by Narasimhavarma II, a peaceliving ruler. During his reign, clashes between
the Pallavas and chalukyas were few. He is also
remembered for building the famous
Kailashanatha temple at Kanchi. He died
grieving his elder son’s accidental death in 722.
His youngest son, Parameshwaravarma II, came
to power in 722. He was a patron of arts and
had little interest in fighting. He proved to be a
very soft opponent to his contemporary
Chalukya king, Vikramaditya II, who had the
support if the Ganga king, Yereyqppa. He died
in 730 with no heirs to the throne, which left the
Pallava kingdom in a state of disarray.
Nandivarma II came to power after some
infighting for the throne among relatives and
officials of the kingdom. He waged war against
the Pandyas and crushed them at a time when
they got no support from the Chalukyas; Instead,
the Chalukyan king Deertivarma (son of
Vidramaditya II) waited for the defeat of
Pandyas at the hands of Pallavas, and
immediately afterword waged war against the
war-torn Pallava army and defeated it. However,
Nandivarma married the Rashtrakuta princess
Reetadevi, and reestablished the Pallava
kingdom. He was succeeded by Dantivarma
(796-846) who ruled for 54 long years.
Dantivarma was defeated by the Rastrakut king,
Dantidurga, and subsequently by the Pandyas.
He was succeeded by Nandivarma III in 846.
Accounts in the Tamil book Nandikkalubalakom
say that the Pallava kings who followed were
powerful. Nandivarma III was succeeded by
Nrupatungavarma, who had two brothers,
Aparajitavarma and Kampavarma. The Chola
king provoked Aprajita varma into waging a civil
war in the Pallava kingdom. Subsequently,
Aprajita Varma captured the throne but had to
pay heavy costs to the Cholas for their help.
Later, incompetent kings and political instability
reduced the Pallavas to petty kingdom. This
brought the Cholas to formidable position in the
south Indian political stage.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE CHALUKYAS</i></strong></div>

History of the Chalukyas, the Karnataka
rulers, can be classified into three eras: 1) the
early western era (6th -8th century), the
Chalukyas of Badami; 2) the later western era
(7th - 12th century), the Chalukyas of Kalyani;
3) the eastern chalukya era (7th - 12th century),
the chalukyas of Vengi. The Chinese traveler,
Hieun Tsang, gives an elaborate account of the
Chalukyas in his travelogue. Pulakesin I (543-
567) was the first independent ruler of Badami
with Vatapi in Bijapur as his capital. Kirthivarma
I (566-596) succeeded him at the throne. When
he died, the heir to the throne, Prince Pulakesin
II, was just a baby and so the king’s brother,
Mangalesha (597-610), was crowned the
caretaker ruler. Over the years, he made many
unsuccessful attempts to kill the prince but was
ultimately killed himself by the prince and his
friends. Pulakesin II (610-642), the son of
Pulakesin I, was a contemporary of
Harshavardhana and the most famous of the
Chalukyan kings. He increased the size of his
kingdom by annexing the entire Andhra
kingdom. His reign is remembered as the greatest
period in the history of Karnataka. He defeated
Harshavardhana on the banks of the Narmada.
In the north, pulakeshin II subdued the Latas,
Malavas, and Gurjara. He also annexed the three
kingdoms of Maharashtra, Konkan, and
Karnataka. After conquering the Kosalas and the
Kalingas, and eastern Chalukyan dynasty was
inaugurated by his brother Kubja
Vishnuvardana. This dynasty absorbed the
Andhra country by defeating the Vishnukundin
king Vidramendravarman III. Moving south,
pulakeshin II allied himself with the Cholas,
Keralas, and Pandyas in order to invade the
powerful Pallavas. By 631, the Chalukyan empire
extended from sea to sea. However, Pulkeshin II
was defeated and probably killed in 642, when
the Pallavas, in retaliation for an attack on their
capital, captured the chalukyan capital at
Badami.
<br>
<br>
The Chalukyas rose to power once again
under the leadership of Vikramaditya I (655-681),
who defeated his contemporary Pandya,
Pallava, Cholas and Kerala rulers to establish the
supremacy of the Chalukyan empire in the
region. He was succeeded by his son
Vinayaditya(681-696), who was an able
administrator. He had many victories to his
account, prominent among them credit against
Yashovarma being the once (king of Kanauj). He
was succeeded by his son Vijayaditya (696-733),
who was succeeded by his son Vikramaditya II
(733-745) who defeated the Pallava king
Nandivarma II to capture a major portion of the
Pallava kingdom. However, Vikramaditya II’s
son, Kirtivarma II (745), was disposed by the
Rastrakuta ruler, Bhantidurga, who established
the Rashtrakuta dynasty as a force to reckon with
in Karnataka’s Political scenario.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE PANDYAS OF MADURAI (6TH TO
14TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

The pandyas were one of the most ancient
dynasties to rule south India and are mentioned
in Kautilya’s Arhasastra and Megasthenes’
Indica. The Sangam age started from a Pandya
king and, as per Sangam literature, there were
at least twenty kings in this dynasty. The most
prominent among them was Nedunzalian, who
made Madurai his capital. Pandya rulers
exercised a clan-rule under several Lineages,
each bearing Tamil names ending with suffixes
such as Valuti and Celiyan. The Pandyas
acquired their resources in inter-tribal conflicts
with the cheras and Cholas, and luxury goods
from their maritime trade with countries further
west. The Pandyas founded a Tamil Literary
academy called the Sangam, at Madurai They
adopted the Vedic religion of sacrifice and
patronized Brahmin priests. Their power
declined with the invasion of a tribe called the
Kalabhras. After the Sangam Age, this dynasty
lost its significance for more than century, only
to rise once again at the end of the 6th century.
Their first significant ruler was Dundungan (590-
620) who defeated the Kalabars and brought the
pandyas back to the path of glory. The list known
Pandya king, Parakramadeva, was defeated by
Usaf Khan, (a viceroy of Muhmmad-bin-Tughlaq
when the Tughlaq dynasty was in process of
extending their kingdom up to Kanyakumari.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE CHOLAS
(9TH TO 13TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

The Chola dynasty was one of the most
popular dynasties of south India which ruled
over Tamil Nadu and parts of Karnataka with
Tanjore as its capital. Rock edicts II and XII of
Ashoka rare the earliest historical documents to
refer to the Cholas. Early Chola rulers were the
karikala Cholas who ruled in the 2nd century.
After them, the Chola dynasty remained
insignificant for centuries before resurfacing
when, in 850, Vijayalaya captured Tanjore
during the Pandya-Pallava wars. To
commemorate his accession, he built a temple at
Tanjore,
<br>
<br>
The king was the central head who was
helped by a council of ministers. However, the
administration was democratic. Land revenue
and trade tax were the main sources of income.
Society was divided into Brahmins and nonBrahmins. The temple was the cultural and social
centre, where art and literature flourished. The
giant statue of Gomateswara at Shravanbelagola
was also built during this period. Vijayalaya’s
son Aditya I (871-901) succeeded him to throne.
Aditya died in 907 leaving the throne to his son
Parantaka I (907-955) who was king for the next
48 years. But it was Rajaraj I (985-1014) who
was the founder of newly organized Chola
kingdom. He snatched back lost territories form
the Rashtrakutas and become the most powerful
of the Chola rulers. Rajendra Chola (1014-144),
son of Rajaraja I, was an important ruler of this
dynasty who conquered Orissa, Bengal, Burma
and the Andaman and Nicobar Island. The
Cholas dynasty was at its zenith during his reign.
The last ruler of the Chola Dynasty was Rajendra
III (1246-79). He was a weak ruler who
surrendered to the pandyas. Later, Malik Kafur
invaded this Tamil state in 1310 and
extinguished the Chola empire.
<br>
<br>
Rajaraja I (985-1014) who was known by a
variety of titles such as mummadi choladeva.
Jayandonada, and chola-martanda, began the
most glorious epoch of the Cholas. He used his
military powers to rebuild the Chola empire and
raise himself to a position of supremacy in the
south. One of the earliest exploits of Rajaraja I
was the subjugation of the Cheras, whose fleet
he destroyed at Kandalur. He then took Madurai
and captured the panday king, Amarabhujanga.
At this time the affairs of Srilanka were in a state
of disarray; hence, he invaded the island and
annexed its northern part which became a
Cholas province under the name Munnadi colamandalam. Rajaraja I then overran the eastern
Chalukyan country of Vengi. The conquests of
Rajaraja I included Kalinga and “ the old islands
of the sea numbering 12,000”, which have been
generally identified with the Laccadives and the
Maldivas. Rajaraja’ is also famous for the
beautiful siva temple which he constructed at
Thanjavur. It is called Rajarajeswava after his
name and is specially admired for its huge
proportions, simple design, elegant sculpters,
and fine decorative motifs. On the walls of the
temple, is engraved an account of Rajaraja’s
ecploits.
<br>
<br>
Rajendra I gangaikonda (1014-44) secceeded
Rajaraja I. A few years after coming to the throne,
he annexed the whole of Sri Lanka's, northern
part having been previously conquered by
RajarajaI. The following year he reasserted the
Chola supermacy over the kings of Kerala and
the Pandyan country. Rajendra I also directed
his arms towards the North, and his armies
marched triumphantly as far as the Ganga and
the dominions of the Pala king Mahipala. It was
doubtless an audacious campaign and to
commemorate it he adopted the title of
gangaikonda, Rajendra I invited a number of
Hiavas form Bengal in to his kingdom. The chola
monarch’s achievements were not invited to
land. He possessed a fowerful fleet which gained
successes across the Bay of Bengal. It is said that
he vanquished Sangramavijayottungavarman
and conquered kataha or Kadaram (Sumatra).
Presumably, the expediton was undertaken to
further commercial intercourse between the
Malay peninsula and South India. Rajendra I
founded a new capital called after himGangaiknoda-Cholapuram, indentified with
modern Gangakundapuram in the Tiruchiraplli
district of Tamil Nadu. It has magnificent place
and a temple adorned with exquisite granite
sculptures.
<br>
<br>
Kulottunga I (1070-1122) was another
significant Chola ruler. Kulottunga I united the
two kingdom of the eastern Chalukyas of Vengi
and the Cholas of Thanjavur. Kullottunga I
introduced certain reforms in the internal
administration of the kingdom. Of these, the
most important was that he got the land
resurveyed for taxation and revenue purposes.
Despite being a devout Shaiva by faith, he is
known to have made grants to the Buddhist
shrines at Megapatam. After a long reign of
about half a century, Kulottunga I passed away
sometime in 1122 and was succeeded by his son,
Vikrama Chola, surnamed Tyagasamudra, who
had earliar held the viceroyalty of Vengi.
Vikrama Chola (1118-33) and his immediate
successors, Kulottunga II (1133-47), Rajaraja II
(1147-62) and Rajadhiraja II (1162-78), were all
weak rulers under whom the power of the
cholas rapidly declined and their place was taken
by the Hoysalas of Dwarsamundra and Pandyas
of Madurai.
<br>
<br>
The Cholas (like the Pallavas) undertook vast
irrigational projects. Apart from sinking wells
and excavating tanks, they built mighty stone
dams across the Kaveri and other rivers, and cut
out channels to distribute water over large tracts
of land One of the most remarkable achievements belongs to the time of Rajendra I. He dug
an artificial lake which was filled with water
form the Klerun and the Vellar rivers near his
new capital, Gangaikonda Chlapuram. The Cholas also constructed grand trunk roads which
served as artorvals along important roads, and
public ferries were provided across rivers.
The Chola rulers were mainly worshippers
of Siva, but they were not intolerant of other
prevaints faiths. Rajaraja I, and ardent Saiva
himself, built and endowed temples of Vishnu
and made gifts of the Buddhist Vihara at
Negapatam. Kulottuga I, also a Shaiva, is
recorded to have granted a village to a Buddhist
vihar. The jains also appear to have pursued their
faith in peace and harmony.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SOUTH INDIAN VILLAGE SYSTEM</i></strong></div>

The organisation which was responsible for
the continuity of life and tradition in the midst
of frequent political changes in south India was
the village, and the vitality of this institute is
attested by hundreds of inscriptions from all arts
of south India. The degree of autonomy at the
south Indian village level was quite remarkable.
Participation of royal officials in village affaris
was more as advisors and observers than as
administratiors.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Type of Villages</i></strong></div>

The village with an intercaste population,
paying taxes to the king in the form of land
revenue, was the most frequent type.
Brahmadeya or agrahara villages were
villages granted to Brahmins and inhabited
entirely by them. These were less common than
the first type, but much more porsperous,
because of their exemption from tax.
Devadan were villages granted to god, they
functioned more or less in the same manner sa
the first type except that the revenues form these
villages were donated to temple, and, hence,
received by the temple authorities and not by
the state.
<br>
<br>
During the Pallava period, the first two type
were predominant, but under the Cholas when
temples become the centres of life, the third of
the last type gained more popularity.
The emperor was the pivot on which the
whole machinery of the state turned. He
discharged his onerous duties and responsibilities
with the advice and help of ministers and other
high offcers. The inscriptions of the Cholas prove
that there system of administration was highly
organise and efficient. Public revenue was
derived mainly from land and collected in kind,
or in cash, or in both, by village assemblies. Land
was possessed by individual and communities.
There were peasant proprietorship and other
forms of land tenure. The state’s demand of land
revenue seems to have been one third of the gross
produce in the time of Rajaraja I. The other items
of public income were customs and tolls, which
were taxes on various kinda of professions,
mines, forests. salt, etc. There were occasional
famines, general or local; the visitation of 1152
evidently belonged to the former category,
though there is evidence of the sympathetic
administration of the tax system-Kulottunga I
earned fame by abolishing toll some cases of
oppression are on record. The chief items of
public expenditure were the regular expenses of
the king and his court, army and navy, civil
administrative staff, roads, and irrigation tanks
and channels besides temples and religious
endowments.
<br>
<br>
The village assembly held society together
through its unique feature of an autonomous selfsufficient village. 
The village was the primary unit of society and polity. From inscriptional
records we are able to trace the presence of at
least three types of assembly held society
together through its unique feature of an
autonomous self-sufficient village. The village
was the primary unit of society and polity, from
inscriptional records we are able to trace the
presence of at least three types of assemblies
which played a regular part in local
administration, namely (a) the ur, (b) the sabha
or mahasabha and (c) the nagaram. The ur was
evidently the more common type of assembly of
the normal villages. Land was held by all classes
of people who were, therefore, entitled to
membership in the local assembly. The sabha was
apparently an exclusively Brahmin assembly of
the brahmadeya villages where, all the land
belonged to the Brahmins.
<br>
<br>
The nagaram was an assembly of merchants
and belonged to localities where traders and
merchants were in a dominate position.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Functioning and constitution of assemblies</i></strong></div>

The functioning of assemblies differed form
place to place according to local conditions. The
ur was open to all the tax paying adults of the
village, but in effect, the older members played
more prominent role with some forming a small
executive body, the ur had an executive body,
called alunganam, whose numerical strength
and the manner of the appointment of its
members are not clear. The sabha had a more
complex machinery, and it funtctioned very
largely through its committees called the
variyams. Both usually constituted smaller
committees of different sizes from among their
members for specialised work.
<br>
<br>
Election to the executive body and other
committees of the ur of sabha appears to have
been conducted by draw of lots form among
those who were eligible, though amendments to
the constitution and working of the ur or sabha
were made whenever necessary. The
Uttaramerur Inscription, behinging to the reign
of Parantaka I (10th century), gives us detail
about the functioning and constitution of the
local sabha. It mentions not only qualifications,
ranging from property and education to honesty,
but also disqualification of the local sabha. It
mentions not only qualifications, ranging form
property and education to honesty, but also
disqualifications such as lunacy and corruption.
Other inscriptions also give similar information,
though there are a few variations. The assembly
generally met in the premises of the temple. The
assemblies collected the assessed land revenue
for the government or the temple (assessment
could be either joint or individual). They levied
additional tax for a particular purpose such as
the construction of a water tank. They settled
agrarian disputes such as conflicts over tenures
and irrigation rights. They maintained records,
particularly those pertaining to charities and
taxes on larger assemblies.
<br>
<br>
The two Uttaramerur inscriptions of the
twelfith and fourteenth years (919 and 921) of
the Chola monarch Parantaka I may be
considered great landmarks in the history of the
Chola village assemblies. In these inscriptions,
we see the completion of the transition from the
appointment of individual executive officers (the
variyar) by the sabha to the establishment of a
fairly elaborate committee system. By this means,
important sections of local administration were
entrusted to committees (Variyam) of six or
twelve members according to the importance of
their functions. The first inscription laid down
rules for the election of the various committees,
and the second inscription, dated two years later,
amended these rules with a view to removing
some practical difficulties that had been
experienced in their working.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE CHERAS
(9TH TO 12TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

The Chera kingdom was another historical
Tamil chiefdoms of southern India, which
controlled the Cauvery river valley. It first arose
some time after the 3rd century BC with
Karuvur-Van-chi as its inland political centre
and Muchiri on the Kerala cost as its port of
trade, where merchants exchanged pepper for
gold and wine from the Raman empire. The
Cheras exercised a clan rule under different
Lingages. Its rulers apparently fought intertribal
conflicts with the Cholas and Pandyas, and
subjugated minor chiefs of the Velir clan. The
Chera kingdom o Makotai was established in the
9th century in the Periyar valley of Derala, with
Makotaipuram (kodungallur) and Quilon as its
first and second capital. The kingdom acquired
an agrarian base through land grants to
Brahmins and Brahmin institutions, such as
temples to Siva and Vishnu, trading ventures
with Arab and Jewish lands provided
commercial resources. Contemporary texts give
an account of the ruling dynasty's legendary
origins and history. Makotai was supposedly
hostile to the Pandyas but friendly with the
Mushakas of Kerala. Despite a series of defensive
wares, constant invasions by the Cholas of
Tanjavur led to the disintegration of the Makotai
kingdom by the early 12th century.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE RASHTRAKUTA</i></strong></div>

The term 'rashtakuta' means designated
officers-in-charge of territorial division called
rashtra. The originally belonged to Lattatura or
modern Latur of Maharashtra. They were
feudatories under the Chalukyas of Badami. The
Rashtrakutas were descendants of the nobles
who governed under the Andhras. They were
follower of jainism. Dhantidurga (735-756)
established this kingdom. His ancestors were
subordinates of the Chalukyas. They overthrew
the Chalukyas and ruled up to 973. Dhantidurga
was succeeded by his son Krishna I (756-774).
Krishna I is credited to have built the Kailasa
temple at Ellora. He is also said to have totally
eclipsed the contemporary Chalukya rulers.
Other kings of this dynasty were Govinda II (774-
780), Dhruva (780-790), Govinda III (793-814)
and Amoghavarsa Nrupatunga I (814-887). The
extend of the Amoghavarsa’s empire can be
estimated from the accounts of the Arabian
traveller, Sulaiman, who visited his court in 1851
and wrote in his book that ‘his kingdom was one
of the four great empires of the world at that
time.’ However, Amoghavarsha lacked the
maratial spirit of his predecessors, partly due to
his leanings towards religion and literature. The
principles, appealed to him. He was a patron of
literature and patronished men of letters, such
as Kinasena, the author of Adipurana,
Mahaviracharya, the author of Ganitasara
Samgraha and Saktayana, the author of
Amonghavriti. Amoghavarsha himself wrote
Kavirajamarga which is the earliest Kannada
work on poetics.
<br>
<br>
Among Amoghavarsha’s successors, two
significant Rashtrakuta rulers were Indra III
(915-27) and Krishna III (939-5-65). Indra III
defeated the Paratihara king Mahipala I,
plundered his capital Kanauj, and challenged
the eastern Chalukyas. The Arab traveler AlMashdi, who visited India during this period,
calls the Rashtrakuta king the, ‘greatest king of
India.’ Krishna III, fourth in succession from
Indra III, invaded the Chola kingdom and his
army reached Rameswaram, where he built a
pillar of victory and a temple. In about 963 he
led an expedition of northern India and brought
Vengi under his control by putting his nominee
on the throne. But by waging wars almost against
all his neigbours, he aliennated them and created
serious problems for his successors. During the
reign of his successors, the situation worsened
on account of the internal dissensions including
the wars of succession. Taking advantage of this
situation, the Paramaras of Malwa, who were
the feudatories of the Rashtrakuta, declared their
independence and invaded the Rashtrakuta
kingdom and plundered the Rashtrakuta capital
Manyakheta (modern Malkhed, Maharashtra)
in 972-73. Soon, other feudatories of the
Rashtrakutas also became independent. Thus, by
the end of 10th century the Rashtakutas
completely disappeared form the scene,
The dynasty of the Dhalukyas of Kalyani was
founded by Tailapa after overthrowings the
Rashtrakutas in 974-75, The dynasty founded
by him, with its capital at Kalyani (Karnataka),
is known as the later Chalukyas of the Chalukyas
of Kalyani (the early Chalukyas being the
Chalukyas of Badami). Tailapa ruled for twentythree years form 974 to 997. He made extensive
conquests during his reign. By defeating the
Gangas, he conquered North Mysore. He fought
a protracted war with the Paramaras of Malwa
and eventually took Paramara Munja, prisoner
and executed him in his capital. He opened the
longdrawn phase of wars against the Cholas of
Thanjavur, by attacking Uttama Chola. The
Chaluky-Chola power struggle become a regular
feature during the period of his successors. This
lead to weakening of the dynasty and decline of
its financial resources.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CAUSES OF TRIPARTITE STRUGGLE</i></strong></div>

Causes for Tripartite Struggle between the
Pratiharas, Palas and Rashtrakutas are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To acquire supremacy over Kanauj, as
symbol of prestige.</li>
        <li>Te get control over the rich resources of
the Gangetic valley.</li>
        <li>To get control over Gujarat and Malwa
whose nearness to the coast was very
important for forging trade.</li>
        <li>Lust for war booty, and important
source for maintaining a huge army.</li>
        <li>Desire to impress the smaller kingdoms
with the sense of their power and
demand respect.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Rashtrakutas were tolerant in religious
matters and patronised not only Saivism as will.
The Rashtrakuta rulers were even tolerant of
Islam. They permitted Muslim merchants to
settle, build their mosques and preach their
religion in the Rashtrakuta dominions. Their
tolerant policies gave a great impetus to trade
and commerce.
<br>
<br>
In the field of literature also, their tolerant
spirit is visible. They equally patronised Sanskrit,
Prakrit, Apaghransa, a forerunner of many
modern India languages, and Kannada They
patronised the arts liberally. The rock-cut cave
temples at Ellora-Brahmanical. Buddhist and jain
are the symbols of their religious toleration and
are one of the splendours of Indian art. The
Kailash Temple, built by the Rashtrakut king
Drishna I, is an unrivalled and stupendous piece
of art. The ancient Indian rock-cut architecture
reached its zenith under the Rashtrakutas.
The last great Chalukya ruler was
Vikramakitya VI (1076-1126) who, on his
coronation, withdrew the Saka era and introduced the Chalukya-Vikram era. Vikramaditya VI
was a great patron of writers. Bilhana, the author
of the Vikramankadevacharita and
Vijananeshvara, the commentator of the
Mitakshara commentator on the Smritis,
adorned his court. In 1085, he invaded Kanchi
and annexed some Chola territories in Andhra.
He fought numerous wars against the Hoysalas
of Dwarasamudra, the Kakatiyas of Warangal.
The Yadavas of Devagiri and the Kadambas of
Goa, who were all the feudatories of the
Chalukyas. Despite defeating them he could not
suppress their power and within three decades
of this death. Most of the leading Khalukyan
feudatories asserted their imdependence once
again, by the middle of the twelfth century, The
Chalukyan kingdom of Kalyan, had become
almost extinct and their place was taken by the
kaktiyas of Warangal, the Hoysalas of
Dwarasamudra and the Yadavas of Devigiri.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE PRATIHARAS
(8TH TO 10TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

The Pratihars were also called GurjarPratihars probably because they originated from
Gurjarat or Southwest Rajasthan. It is believed
that originally they were a branch of the
Gurjaras, which was one of the nomadic central
Asian tribes that poured into India along with
the Hunas following the disintegration of the
Gupat Empire. As rulers, the Pratiharas came
into prominence in the middle of the eight
century when their king, Nagabhatta I, defended
western India form the Arab incursions form
Sindh into Rajasthan. He was able to leave to
his successors a powerful principality comprising
Malwa and parts of Rajputana and Gujarat.
After the Nagabhatta I regin, the Pratiharas
suffered a series of defeats mostly at the hands
of the Rashtrakutas. The Pratihara power
regained its lost glory only after only after the
succession of Mihirbhomja, popularly known as
Bhoja. He had a long reign of 46 years and his
evenful career drew the attention of the Arab
traveler, Sulaiman. He reestablidhed the
supremacy of his family in Bundelkhand and
subjugated Jodhpur. The Daulatpura copper
plate of Bhoja shows that the pratihara king had
succeeded in reasserting his authority over
central and eastern Rajputana. Mihirbhoja was
succeeded by his son Mahendrapala I whose
most notable achievement was the conquest of
Magadha and northern Bengal. Mahendrapala
I was a Liberal patron of literature. The most
brilliant writer in his court was Rajasekhara who
has to his credit a number of literary worksKarpuramanjari, Bala Ramayana, Bala and
Bharta, Kavyamimamsa.
<br>
<br>
Mahendrapala’s death was followed by a
scramble for the possession of the throne. Bhoja
II seized the throne, but half brother, Mahipala
soon usurped the throne. The Rashtrkutas again
challenged the strength of the Pratihara empire
and its ruler, Indra III, completely devastated the
city of Kanauj. However, the withdrawal of
Indra III to the Deccan enabled Mahipala to
recover form the fatal blow. Mahendrapala II,
son and successor of mahipala, was able to keep
his empire intact. But it received a shattering
blow during the reign of Devapala, when the
Chandelas become virtually independent. The
process of decline of the Pratihara empire which
had begun with Devapal accelerated during the
reign of Vijayapala.
<br>
<br>
Thus, we find that the Pratiharas emerged
as one of the most powerful empires of the early
medieval period. The Arab traveler Al-Masudi,
who visited India in the year 915-16, also refers
to the power and resouces of the king of Kanauj
whose kingdom extended up to Sind in the west
and touched the Rashtrakuta kingdom in the
south.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE PALAS
(8TH TO 11TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

Sulaiman, an Arab merchant who visited
India in the 9th century has termed the Pala
empire as Rhumi. The Pala Empire was founded
by Gopal in 750. It is believed that he was elected
as the king by the notable men of the area to end
the anarchy prevailing there after the death of
Sasanka of Bengal. Gopala was an ardent
Buddhist and is supposed to have built the
monastery at Odantapuri (Sharif district of
Bihar). Gopala was succeeded by his son
Bharmapla who raised the Pala kingdom to
greatness. The kingdom expanded under him
and it comprised the whole of Bengal and Bihar.
Besides, the kindom of Kanauj was a
dependency, ruled by Dharmapal’s own
nominee. Beyond Kanuja, there were a large
number of vassal states in the Punjab, Rajputana,
Malwa and Berar whose rulers acknowledged
Dharmapala as their overlord.
However, Dharmapala’s trimphant career
was soon challenged by his pratihara adversary.
After a reign of 32 years Dharmapal died, leaving
his extensive dominions unimpaired to his son
Devapala. Devapala ascended the throne in 810
and Ruled for 40 years. He extended his control
over Pragjyotishpur (Assam), parts of Orissa and
parts of Modern Nepal Devapal was a great
patron of Buddhism and his fame spred to many
buddhist countries outside India. As a Buddhist,
he founded the famous mahavihara of
Vkramasial near Bhagalpur. He also credited
with the construction of a vihara at Somapura
(Paharpur). He also patronised Haribhadra, one
of the great Buddhist authors.
<br>
<br>
Balaputradeva, a king of the Buddhist
Sailendras, ruling Java, sent an ambassador to
Devapala, asking for a grant of five villages in
order to endow a monastery at Nalanda.
Devapala granted the request and appointed
Viradeva, as head of Nalanda Monastery.
Devapala’s court was adorned with the Buddhist
poet Vijrakatta, the author of Lokesvarasataka.
The glory of the Pala empire suffered with
the death of Devapala. The rule of his successors
was marked by a steady process of disintegration.
A series of invasions led by the Chandellas and
the Kalachuris dismembered the Pala Empire.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE SENAS
(11TH TO 12TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

 The Sena dynasty ruled Bengal after the
Palas. Its founder was Samantasena described
as a ‘brahmakshatriya’. The title brahmakshatriya shows that Samantasena was a brahmin,
but his successors called themselves simply Kshatriyas. Samantasena’s son Hemantasena took
advantage of the unstable political situation of
Bengal and carved out an independent principality. Vijayasena, son of Hemantasena, brought
the family into the limelight by comquering nearly the whole of Bengal. Vijayasena assumed several immaterial titles like paramesvara, paramabhattaraka, and maharajadhiraja. He had two
capitals, which was one, at Vijaypuri of Bangladesh. The famous poet Sriharasha composec
the Vijayaprasasti in memory of Vijayasena. Vijayasena was succeeded by his son, Ballalasena.
Ballalasena was a great scholar. He wrote four
works of which two are extant, the Banasagara
and the Adbhutasagara. The first is an extensive work on omens and portents, and the second on astronomy. Lakshmanasena succeeded
Ballalasena in 1179. The reign of Lakshmanasena was remarkable for patronising literature. He
was a devout Vaishnava and, Jayadeva, the famous Vaishnava poet of Bengal and author of
the Gita Govinda lived at his court. His reign saw
the decline of the Sena power because of internal rebellions. The invasion of Bakhtiya Khalji
gave it a crushing blow. A detailed account of
the invasion of Bakhtiya Khalji has been given
in Tabakat-i-Nasiri.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS (OF VENGI)
(8TH TO 10TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

Vishnuvardhana was the founder of the
dynasty of the eastern Chalukyas of Vengi.
Pulakesin II of Badami subdued the king of
Pishtapura (Pitapuram in the Godavari district)
and the vishnukundin king and appointed his
younger brother, Vishnuvardhana, vicerory of
the newly conquered territories. Very soon, the
Viceroyalty developed into an independent
kingdom and Vishnuvardhana became the
founder of dynasty known as the eastern
Chalukyas of Vengi (Vijayawada). This is the
earliest reference of Jainism in the telugu country.
Vishnuvardhana himself was a Bhagavata.
Vishnuvarkhana was succeeded by his son
Jayasimha I. His fater, Jayasimha was also a
Bhagavata. He was succeeded by
Vishnuvardhana II, Vijayasiddhi, jayasimha II,
Vikramaditya, Vishnuvardhana III and then by
Vijayadity one after another. His reign withessed
a great political revolution in the Deccan when
the imperial Chalukyas were overthrown by the
Rashtrikutas who began a protracted struggle
against the eastern Chalukyas.
<br>
<br>
Vijayaditya was succeeded by his brother’s
son Bhima. His succession was disputed by his
uncle, Yaddamalla, who seized Vengi with the
help of the Rashtrakuta king, Krishna II. The
Chalukyan nobles, however, succeeded in
restoring the kingdom to its lawful master after
defeating Krishna II. He was a devotee of Siva
and built the temples of Bhimavaram and
Draksharamam in the east Godavari district.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE YADAVAS (OF DEVGIRI)
(12TH TO 13TH CENTURY)</i></strong></div>

The first member of the dynasty was
Dridhaprahara. However, Seunachandra I, the
son of Dridhaprahar, was the first to secure
feudatory status for his family from the
Rashtrakutas. The importance of this chief can
be assessed from the fact that the territory ruled
by the Yadavas came to be known as Seunadesa. Meanwhile, the great Chalukyan power
was already on the read to decline. The Yadavas
naturally took advantage of the situation and
asserted their independence. Bhillama, thus, laid
the foundationof the yadava Empire which
endured for about a century.
<br>
<br>
Simhana was the most powerful ruler of the
family. As the Hoyasalas proved a great obstacle
to the further expansion of the kingdom in the
south, Simhana launched a successful campaign
against them. Elated by his successes in the
south, Simhana waged war against his
hereditary enemies in the north-the Paramaras
of malwa and the Chalukyas of Gujarat. He
defeated and killed the Paramara king
Arjumavarman. Thus, the Yadava kingdom
reached the zenith of its glory and power in the
reign of Simhana. Many among the Hoyasalas,
the Kakatiyas, the Paramaras and the Chalukyas
dared to challenged his supremacy in the Deccan.
Simhana was not merely a wirrior, but was
also a patron of music and literature.
Singitaratnakara of Sarangadeva, an important
work on music, was written in his court.
Anantadeva and Changadeva were the two
famous astronomers who also adorned his court.
Changadeva established a college of astronomy
at Patana in Khandesh in memory of his
illustrious grandfather, Bhaskaracharya.
Anantadeva wrote a commentary on
Bharahmagupta’s Brahmasphhutra Siddhanta
and Varahamihira’s Brihat Jataka.
Sankaradeva was probably the last of the
Yadava rulers. After his accession, hi
immediately repudiated the authority of
Alauddin. Malik kafur easily defeated
Kankaradeva, put him to death and annexed the
Yadav kingdom.
<br>
<br>
The period between the 9th and 11th century
saw the energence of warrior castes-military
ruling clans which ultimately coalesced into a
single caste, that of the Rajputs, the term being
derived, from the Sanskrit word rajaputra. The
four Rajput clans that claimed a special status
during his time were the Prathiharas, the
Chalukyas, the Chauhans (also called
Chahamanas) and the Dolankis.
Western and Central India provide us with
example of a fresh spurt in the emergence of local
states. For example, the Rajput clans such as the
Gujarara, Prathihar, Guhila, Paramara,
Chahamana as well as the Kalachuriwa and
Chandella exploited political uncertainties of the
post-Gupa era in western and central India. They
donimated the political scene for centuries,
especially during the period exending from the
eighth to the thirteenth centuries. The picture of
the political processes that resulted in the
replacement of old dynasties by new Rajput
powers of uncertain origin is not clear.
Nonetheless an attempt has been made to work
out some essential traits of the nature of the
distribution of political authority. Unlike
northern and eastern India, the region showed
some influence of Iineage-at least in some parts
of the region. Even in these parts, the dispersal
of administrative and fiscal powers along with
the changes in the bureaucratic set-up-all based
on new landholding-set the tome of fedual
polity.
<br>
<br>
The problem of the origin of Rajput dynasties
is highly complex and controversial. Their
gotrochhara makes them Kshatriyas of the
Lunar family (somavamshi) while on the basic
of old davyas some maintain that they were of
the solar race. The myths of solar origin regard
them as Kashtriya created in Kaliyuga to wipeout the mlecchas (foreigners). Rajasthani bards
and chroniclers regard them as fire-born
(agnikula). According to the agnikula myth
recorded by a court poet, the founder of the
house of the Paramaras originated form the
firepit of sage Vasistha on Mount Abu. The man
who thus sprang out of the fire forcibly wrested
the wish-granting cow of sage Vasishtaha form
sage Vishwamitra and restored it to the former.
Sage Vasistha gave him the fitting name of
paramara-slayer of the enemy. From him sprang
a race, which was regarded with high esteem
by virtuous kings. The Parakara inscription also
declare th origin of the Paramaras form the
firepit of sage Vasishtha on the Mount Abu. The
Rajasthani bards went a step further and
described the five origin not only to the
Paramaras but also to the Prathiharax, the
Chalukyas of Gujarat and the Chahamanas. The
practice of new social groups claiming Dshatriya
status become widespread in the early medieval
period. Kshatriya status was one of the various
symbols that the emergent social groups sought
for the legitimation of their newly acquired
power. The early medieval and medieval Rajput
clans, representing a mixed caste and
constituting a fairly large section of petty chiefs
holding estates, achieved political eminence
gradually, There was a direct relationship a
Kshatriya lineage. In this context, it is important
to note that these dynasties claimed descent from
ancient Kshatriyas long after their accession to
power.
<br>
<br>
A preliminary idea of the processes idea of
the processes involved may be formed by trying
to defind the term rajput. In the early medieval
period too, as in other periods, it may not be at
all easy to distinguish the Rajputs from the non
Rajputs, despite the clear evidence regarding
certain recognisable clans and frequent
references to the Rajaputras in inscriptions and
literature. If the early medieval and medieval
references to the Rajputras in general are taken
into account, they represented a mixed caste and
constitited a fairly large section of petty chiefs
holding estates. The criterion for inclusion in the
list of Rajput clans was provided by the
contemporary status of a clan at least in the early
stages of the crystallisation of Rajput power.
There are two important pointers to the
process of the emergence of the Rajputs in the
earyl medieval records. As these records suggest,
at one level the process may have to be has to be
traced not only in the significant expansion of
the number of settlements but also in some
epigraphic references, suggesting an expansion
of an agrarian economy.
<br>
<br>
However, to conceive of the emergence of the
Rajputs only in terms of colonisation would be
to take a wrong view of the total process
involved, and here we come to the second pointer
provided by the records. The fact that the mobility
to the Kshatriya status was in operation
elsewhere in the same period, prompts one to
look for its incidence also in Rajasthan, The cases
of two groups who are included in the list of
Rajput clans are significant in this context. One
is that of the Medas who are considered to have
reached the Rajput status form a tribal
background. The other is that of the Hunas. The
inclusion of these two groups in the Rajput clan
structure is sufficient to believe that the structure
could be composed only of such groups as were
initially closely linked by descent, ‘foreign’ or
‘indigenous’.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AGRARIAN AND
POLITICAL STRUCTURES</i></strong></div>

From about the beginning of the eighth
century, there emerged a political set up in
western India and central India in which new
social groups acquired political power by various
means such as settlement of new areas. The
pattern of the emergence of the Rajputs, which
was partly a clan-based organisation of political
authority, shows some deviations form
developments outside western India. However,
the mobility of new powers towards kshatriya
status for legitimation was not specific to western
India as a similar process was in operation
elsewhere in early medieval India. After seeking
legitimacy for their new Kshatriya role, the ruling
clans of western and central India formulated
detailed geneologies in the period of their
transition form feudatory to independent status.
They consolidated their political position by
means of specific patterns of land distribution
and territorial system. Some other prominent
features of the polity and the agrarian
structures in the region are:
organisation of bureaucracy which could
connect different modes in their political
structures marked by different foci or
levels of power.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Dominance of landlord-subordinate
relations.</li>
        <li>Landholding as an important component
of the samanta status.</li>
        <li>Integration of local polities into larger
status polities.</li>
        <li>Certain amount of land-based ranking
associated with politico-administrative
roles and services.</li>
        <li>Wielding of vast-administrative and
financial powers by vassals and officers
to the extent of sub-infeudation.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIAN FEUDALISM</i></strong></div>

This period (from 750 to 1200) in Indian
history has been termed as a period of ‘Indian
Fedualism’ by a few historians. They believed
that a number of changes took place in Indian
society. One significant change was the growing
power of a class of people who are variously
called Samantas, Ranaks, Rauttas etc. Their
origins were very different. Some were
government officers who were defeated rajas
who continued to enjoy the revenue of limited
areas. Still others were local hereditary chiefs or
tribal leaders who had carved out a sphere of
authority with the help of armed supporters. In
course of time these revenue-bearing lands began
to be considered hereditary and monopoly of a
few families. The hereditary chiefs began to
assume many of the functions of the government.
They not only assessed and collected land
revenue but also assumed more and more
administrative power such as the right lands to
their followers without the prior permission of
the rulers. This led to an increase in the number
of people who drew sustenace form the land
without working on it.
The salient features of Indian feudalism were
as follows.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        Emergence of hierarchical landed
intermediaries. Vassal and officers of
state and other secular assignes had
military obligations and were called
Samonta. Subinfeudation (varying in
different regions) by these donees to get
their land cultivalted led to the growth
of different strata of intermediaries. It
was a hierarchy of landed aristocarats,
tenants, share croppers and cultivators.
This hierarchy was also reflected in the
powers, administrative structure, where
a sort of lord vassal relationship
emerged. In other words, Indian
feudalism consisted of the unequal
distribution of land and its produce.
        </li>
        <li>
        Prevalence of forced labour. The right
of extracting forced labour (Vishti) is
believed to have been exercised by the
Brahmanas and other grantees of land.
Forced labour was originally a
prerogrative of the king or the state. It
was transferred to the grantees, petty
officials, village authorities and other.
As a result, a kind of serfdom emerged,
in which agricultural labourers were
reduced to the position of semi-serfs.
        </li>
        <li>
        Due to the growing claims of greater
over them by rulers and intermediares,
peasants also suffered an curtailmat of
their land rights. Many were reduced
to the positon of tenants facing evergrowing threat of eviction. A number
of peasants were only share- croppers
(ardhikas). The strain on the peasantry
was also caused by the burden of
taxation, coercion and increase in their
indebtness.
        </li>
        <li>
        Surplus was extracted through various
methods. Extra economic coercion was
a conspicuous method, new mechanisms
of economic subordination also evolved.
        </li>
        <li>
        It was relatively a closed village
economy. The transfer of human
resources along with land to the
beneficiaries shows that in such villages
the peasants, craftsmen and artisans
were attached to the village and, hence,
were mutually dependent. Their
attachment to land and to service grants
ensured control over them by the
beneficeries.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Recently, the validity of the feudel formation
in the context of medieval India has been
questioned. It has been suggested that the
medieval society was characterised by self
dependent of free-peasant production. The
peasants had control over the means and the
processes of production. It is added that there
was relative stability in social and economic
structure and there was not much change in the
level of techniques of the surplus than over a
redistribution of means of production. The
appropriation of agrarian surplus to the state
formed the chief instrument of exploition. The
high fertility of land and the low subsistence level
of the peasants facilitated the state
appropriation of the surplus in condition of
relative stability.
<br>
<br>
This line of approach does not take note of
superior right and inferior rights of one party or
another over land. In fact, in early medieval
times, in the same piece of land, the peasant held
inferior right and the landlords held superior
right. The landgrants clearly made the position
of the landlords strong over the land as
compared to that of peasants. The critique of
feudal polity does not take note of massive
evidence in support of the subjection and
immobility of peasantry, which is an
indispensable element in the feudal system. Some
of these factors are stated below.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It weakened the position of the ruler,
and made him more dependent on the
feudal chiefs, many of whom
maintained their own military forces
which could be used to defy the ruler.</li>
        <li>The internal weaknesses of the Indian
states became crucial in their contest
with the Turks later on.</li>
        <li>The small states discouraged trade, and
encouraged an economy in which
villages or groups of villages tended to
become largely self-sufficient.</li>
        <li>The domination of the feudal chiefs also
weakened village self-government.</li>
        <li>The feudel order had a few advantages
as well. In an age of disorder and
violence, the stronger feudal chiefs
protected the lines and property of the
peasants and other without which daily
life could not have functioned. Some of
the feudal chief protected the lives and
property of the peasants and others
without which daily life could not have
functioned. Some of the feudal chief also
took an interest in the extension and
improvement of cultivation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



Economically, the first phase, i.e, AD 750–
AD 1000, is believed to be one of decline. It is
evident from the absence of coins for exchange
and the decayed condition of towns inorthern
India. But in the second phase after AD 1000,
we notice a revival of trade activities. Not only
do we come across new gold coins, there are also
numerous references to trade goods and towns.
What could be the reason for it? There seem to
be two main reasons for it. One, there was
increase in agricultural activities on account of
land grants in fresh areas. It led to surplus
production of goods for exchange. And second,
the Arab traders had emerged on the coastal
areas of India as important players in
international sea trade. The Arabs had acquired
a foothold in Sind in AD 712 and later, gradually,
they set up their settlements all along the sea from
Arabia to China. These settlements served as
important channels for the sale and purchase of
Indian goods, and thus helped in the growth of
Indian external trade. In south India, the Chola
kings maintained close commercial contact with
southeast Asia (Malaya, Indonesia etc) and
China.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EXTENT OF SOCIAL MOBILITY</i></strong></div>

Several irregular or mixed castes are
mentioned in the Kharmasastras as coming into
existence as a result of the anuloma and
pratiloma connections, especially the latter.
Some of the latter types of castes are the antyaja
or lowest castes. The later Vedic Literature
mentions about eight mixed castes besides the
four regular varnas. Vasistha raises their number
to ten, Budhayana to fifteen, Gaulama to
eighteen, Manu to about sixty, but the same
mixed origin is not given to the same caste in all
the texts. The Brahmavaivarty Parana, a work
of the early medieval period, raises the number
of the mixed castes to over one hundred.
However, the above theory only partly
explains the proliferation of castes (jatis). Instead,
it seems to be an afterthought provide place for
the numerous tribal peoples in the fourfold. It is
obvious that the Nisadas, Ambasthas, and
Pulkasas, were originally tribal communities, but
once they were admitted into the Brahmanical
society, ingenious origins within the framework
of the varna system were suggested for them,
and here, the fuction of mixed castes of
varnasamkara came in handy,
The first systematic attempt at describing the
samskaras is found in the Grihyasutras. The
number of samkaras in the Grihyasutras fluctuate
between twelve and eighteen. In course of time,
sixteen became the classical number comprising
the following:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Garbhadhana (conception),</li>
        <li>Pumsavana (engendering a male issue),</li>
        <li>Simantonnayan (parting the hair),</li>
        <li>jatakaramn (natal rites), and severing
of navel string</li>
        <li>Namakarana (naming)</li>
        <li>Nishdramana (first outing),</li>
        <li>Chudakarana (tonsure),</li>
        <li>Darnavedha (piercing the ear lobes),</li>
        <li> Vidyarambha or akshararambha
(learning the alphabet),</li>
        <li>Upanayan (holy thread ceremony and
choosing the child’s teacher),</li>
        <li>Vedarambha (first study of the Vedas)</li>
        <li>Kesanta (cutting the hair),</li>
        <li>Samavartana (graduation and returning
home after completing education),</li>
        <li>Vivaha (marriage), and</li>
        <li>Antyesti (Funeral).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Most of the Dharmasastras mention eight
forms of marriage, of which the first four are
approved forms and the last four unapproved
forms are brahma, prajapatya, daiva and arsa.
The distinction between the brahma and
prajapataya forms of marriage is not all that
clear in both these forms, marriage was
performed according to the prescribed religious
ceremonies. In the daiva form the bride was given
in marriage to a priest, who officiated at a
sacrifice. In the arsa form, the marriage
ceremony was duly performed, but a part of the
ceremony was the presentation of a bull and a
cow by the bridegroom to the bride-price.’
The last four unapproved forms of marriage
are asura, paisacha, rakshasa and gandharva.
Asura vivaha or marriage was marriage by
purchese. In the paisacha form of marriage, the
bride was abducted in an unfair manner. The
rakshasa vivaha was marriage by capture. The
gandharva vivaha was a love marriage.
<br>
<br>
The four approved forms of vivahas were
generally meant for the three lower varnas of
Kshatriyas, Vaishya and Sudra. Within these, the
rakshasa and gandharva forms are permissible
especially for the kshatriyas. The Asura vivaha
in considered to be universal in ancient times.
But it is condemned by the Dharmasastras in
strong terms, probably because of its connection
with the lower vanas. The paisacha vivaha is
the worst of all marriages-Baudhayana
prescribes it for the Vaishyas and Sudras. This is
also corroborated by Manu. These prescriptions
were probably intended to validate the mariiage
practices of those tribes who were absorbed as
two lower varnas in ancient society. The
rakshasa form is prescribed by Manu for the
kshatriyas. Gandharva Vivaha, confined by some
to only the kashtriyas, was probably followed
by men and women of the other varnas as well.
This can be inferred from the rules laid down in
the Dharmasastras as well numerous examples
found in the general Ieterary works.
Though there is neither literary nor
epigraphic evidence about the practice of wide
remarriage in ancient India, it was probably
practiced particularly by the lower varmas. A
passage of Manu states that it cannot take place
among the Brahmins, which implies that it can
take place among the three other varmas.
Niyoga (levirate) was certainly practiced by
the Sudras in the early centuries of the Christian
era, which infact strengthens aur presumption
about the existence of widow remarriage among
the lower varnas.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Position Of Women</i></strong></div>

The very high standard of learning, culture
and as round progress reached by Indian women
during the Vedic age is a well-known fact. The
best proof of this is the fact that the Rigveda, the
oldest known literature in the whole
world,contains hymns by as many as twentyseven women, called brahmavakinis of women
seers. Saunaka in his Brihaddevata (5th century
BC), a work on the rigveda, has mentioned the
name of these twenty-seven women seers.
In the Ramayana and the Mahabharata too,
we find many instance of the two types of Indian
women, ascetic and domestic. A magnificent
example of a brahmavadini in the Ramayana is
Anasuya, wife of the Sage Atri. Another
celebrated woman. She was the disciple of the
great sage Matanga and had her hermitage on
the bank of the lake Pampa On the other hand,
the highest manifestation of domestic perfection
in the Ramayana, is found in the inimitable
personality of Sita, the idol of Nidian
womanhood. The Mahabharata too is
resplendent with a galaxy of great women
fulfilling their destinies. For instance. Suitable,
who was a great scholar, for want of a suitable
bridegroom, became an ascetic for life and
roamed about from place to place in search of
knowledge. Other celebrated brahmavakinis of
the Mahabharata are the daughter of Sandklya
described as a Brahmani and Siva had who
mastered the Vedas. Far more numerous are the
instances of women who led dedicated lives at
home, e.g., Kunti and Draupadi. One of the most
celebrated women of the Puranas is Makalasa,
the escort of king Ritdhvaja. She was at once a
great scholar, a saintly woman and dutiful
housewife. Another saintly woman of the
Puranas is Devahuti, wife of the great sage
Prajapati Kardama and mother of the greater
sage Kapila. The propounder of the samkhya
system of Indian philosophy. Her philosophical
discourses with her learned husband and son
go to prove her unique spiritual attainments,
even though she lived a household life. The
position of women in India gradually
deteriorated as the golden Vedic ideals of unity
and equality began to fade off through the
passage of time. During the period of the Smritis,
women were bracketed with the Sudras, and
were denied the right to study the Vedas, to utter
Vedic mantras, and to perform Vedic rites.
Hence, during such an age, it was not to be
expected that women would continue to enjoy
the old privilege of choosing a life of celibacy and
asceticism. Since women and property are
bracketed together in several reference in the
epics, Smritis and Puranas, there is no doubt that
woman herself was regarded as a sort of
property. She could be given away or loaned as
any item of property. Manu and Yajnavalkya,
for example, hold that a woman is never
independent. This was like the attitude of a
typical patriarchal society based on private
property. Because of this attitude, the
Brahmanical law did not allow any proprietary
rights to to women; the provision for stridhana
is of a very limited character and does not extend
beyond the wife’s rights to jewels, ornaments
and presents made to her. Manu declares that
the wife, the son and the salve are unpropertied,
whatever they earn is the property of those to
whom they belong. This sort of social philosophy
took strong roots in the Gupta and post-Gupta
periods, although the institution of monogamous
family and private property had been developed
much earlier.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE ARABS IN SIND</i></strong></div>

The establishment of Arab rule in Sind in 712
A.D. was preceded by a number of efforts to
penetrate India. The view that the Arabs indeed
were not interested in territorial acquisition till
the ruler of Sind in 700 A.D. provoked them, is
not accepted by the book ‘A Comprehensive
History of India’. This book relies on the authority
of baladhuri, who is regarded as the most reliable
authority on the subject. According to the book,
the Arabs made systematic inroads on the three
kingdoms of Kabul, Zabul and Sind. Very often
the first two were united in resisting the
aggression of the Arabs. Baladhuri says that after
650 A.D. the Arabs entered India. One more
expedition was sent by the Caliphate of Ali to
conquer Kabul but was frustrated. Another
attempt was made in 698 A.D., which was still
less successful. The weakness of the Arabs was
undoubtedly due to internal troubles and
weakness of the Caliphate during the last days
of Umayyids, but after the establishment of
powerful Abbasid Caliphate the earlier designs
were repeated. Kabul was conqured but again
escaped from the control of the Caliphate. Zebul
was conquered only in 870 A.D.
<br>
<br>
Although both Kabul and Zabul succumbed
to Islam the heroic resistance they offered
checked the spread of Islam into the
subcontinent. Few countries in the world, that
too small principalities like these, have defied the
arms of Islam so bravely and for so long 2000
years.
Good number of details are found regarding
the history of Sind in the 7th Century A.D. in
Chachnama, a Persian translation of an old
Arabic history of the conquest of Sind by the
Arabs. An expedition of the Arabs was sent
against Debal some time before 643 A.D.
Baladhuri speaks of Muslim victory but
Chachnama says that the Muslims were
defeated. The conquest of Sind was abandoned
for some time. When then new Calipha Uthman
attempted to conquer, he too left it after a
setback. During the days of Caliphate of Ali, a
well-equipped Muslim Army came along the
land route. According to Baladhuri, the Muslims
were put to rout. After this, a series of expeditions
were sent to conquer an outpost of Sind, which
all ended in failure.
The Arabs resumed their aggression against
Sind only after 705 A.D. An Arab ship fell in the
hands of pirates near Debal. A Muslim governor
demanded their release and also the arrest of the
pirates. It appears, Dehar refused to oblige. As a
matter of fact, the governor for Iraq was
appointed for both the areas of Hindi and Sind.
For long time the Arabs chafed at their failure to
conquer Sind. Thus, the governor Hajja merely
seized the policy as a pretext to defeat and
conquer Sind.
<br>
<br>
After making elaborate preparation,
Mohammad-Bin-Kasim, the son-in-law of Hajjaj,
was sent with a well equipped army. He
advanced to Makran and laid siege to Debal in
711 A.D. The capital was captured then,
Muhammad advanced along the Indus to
conquer the whole area. It appears that very
often treachery led to the Arab conquest of Sind
Muhammad advanced against Multan and
succeeded in capturing it. According to
Chachanam, Muhammad himself advanced to
the frontier of Kashmir.
The triumph and career of Muhammad was
suddenly cut short by political changes at home.
Since the new Caliph was the sworn enemy of
Hajjaj. Muhammad was taken prisoner, insulted
and tortured to death.
This development made Jaisimha, the son of
Daher, to re-occupy Bahmansbad. The Caliph
sent an army to subdue the rebels. They even
parleyed with Jaisimha. Junaid, the Governor of
Sind, defeated Jaisimha and took him prionser.
Thus ended the dynasty of Daher and the
independence of Sind.
The comperatively easy conquest of
Muhammad, son of Kasim, should not make us
forget the long resistance offered by Sind to the
Arabs.
<br>
<br>
Later, Junaid sent several expeditions to the
interior of India. They were signally defeated by
the Pratihara king Nagabhatta - I Pulakesin, the
Chalukya chief of Gujarata, and probably also
by Yasovarman. These defeats forced the Arabs
to confine themselves to Sind. The Arabs lost
control of Sind during the last years of
Umayyids. The Abbasid Caliphs once again
started to re-establish their power in Sind. A
claim was made. The Arabs once again
conquered Multan and Kashmir but the evidence
shows that Lalitadiya thrice defeated the Arabs.
It was some time between 800 and 830 A.D. that
the Arabs fully re-conquered the lost areas. It
was during this period that the Arabs forces
probably advanced as far as Chittor but the
resistance offered by Indian kings probably forced
them to retreat.
After the collapse fo the Abbasid power, Sind
became virually independent and was divided
into two independent states. Neither of them
could become powerful.
Significance:
<br>
    It is no longer believed that the Arab conquest
of Sind was a mere episode in the history of India.
What this event reveals is the sea change that
cave over Hindu Civilisation by 1000 A.D. A few
Muslim traders earlier settled in the Malabar
region. But the might of Islam was experienced
in Sind. This challenge was met by rulers of the
day. It is now well-known that the political
ambitions of the successors of Muhammad-binKasim were check mated by Lalitaditya, Bhoja
and a few other rulers. This particular resistance
bears testimony to the political consciousness of
the day. It is this consciousness that was totally
absent in India when Mahumud of Ghazni
raided the country and soon he was followed
by Ghori who succeeded in establishing Islamic
rule in India. It is surprising to note that when
the Sahiyas checkmated the Arab penetration
in the north-west and rulers within India
contained the penetration of Arabs in Sind, no
concerted efforts were made by Indian rulers
after 1000 A.D. to defeat the invaders except for
the first battle of Tarain to some extent. Instead,
we hear that Hinduism retreated into its own
shell, a fact sharply revealed by the observations
of Alberuni.
<br>
<br>
Apart from this significance, the Arab rule
in Sind led to interaction between two cultures.
It is held by some historians that Sind was the
birth-place of later-day Sufism which in turn
occasioned the emergence of the famous bhakti
cult in the middle ages.
Apart from this consequence, the Arab
conquest of sind also led to the transmission of
Indian culture-Panchtantra and scientific lore of
ancient India like the digital system and
knowledge of medicine. It is to be kept in mind
that after the collapse of the Roman empire
intellectuals began to gather in Baghbad,
meaning city of god in Sanskrit. The intellectual
speculations that the city facilitated by the
interaction of Greek and Roman heritage with
that of the Indian lay at the base of the
Renaissance movement in Europe in the 16th
century. “We know definitely from Masudin Ibn
Hauqal that Arab settlers lived side by side with
their Hindu fellow-citizens for many years on
terms of amity and peace, and Amir Khusrav
mentions that the Arab astronomer Abu Mashar
come to Benaras and studied astronomy there
for ten years.
<br>
<br>
Finally, the significance of the Arab conquest
of Sind lies in the tolerance that was shown to
Hinduism by Islam. Although jaziya was
collected, the Arab governors chose to leave
Hindu religious practices untouched. What India
witnessed after the invasion of Mahmud of
Ghazni was not Islamic influence as pioneered
by the Arabs but central-Asian culture of the
Turkish, nomad who carried the banner of Islam.
In other words, what the history of Arabs in Sind
conveys is the fact that persecution of other
religious was not the avowed doctrine of Islam.
The Arabs had to leave India towards the
end of the 9th century. After the Arabs, the Turks
invaded India. They were attracted mainly by
the fabulous wealth lying in the garbhagriha of
the temples.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE GHAZAVIDS</i></strong></div>

The empire of the Ghaznavids was built on
the ruins of the Abbasid Caliphate concentrated
in west and central Asia. From the end of the
9th Century, the abbasid empire disintegrated
and a series of aggressive, expansionist states
arose. These states were independent in all but
they accepted the nominal suzeriegnty of the
Caliph who legitimised their position by granting
them a formal letter or manshu. In course of time,
the rulers of these states began to be called
sultans. Most of these Sultans were Turks. The
Ghaznavids and the seljuq states were products
of the acculturation of the Turks had expanded
into the institutions of settled societies. Under
the Seljuq umbrella. The Turks had expanded
into the Meditarranean and Byzatine territories.
Anatolia (modern Turkey) was conquered and
settled by the Ottoman Turks. The Turks were
nomadas and lived in areas now known as
Mongolistan and Sinkiang since the 8th century.
They had been filtration into the region called
Mawara-un-nahar, i.e., Transoxiana, which was
the transitional zone between central Asia and
the land of ancient civilisations in east Asia. The
Iranian rulers of the area and the Abbasid
Caliph recruited the Turk as mercenaries and
slaves for their personal needs and security after
getting them converted into Islam. These Turks
quickly assimilated the Iranian Language and
culture and became Islamised and Persianised.
After the disintegration of the Abbasid
empire, the most powerful dynasty which arose
in the region was the Samanid dynasty (874-
999_. The Ghaznavids were displaced by the
Seljukids, and then by the Khwarizmi empire
which had its capital at Merv. These empires
fought with each other and this led to the growth
of militarism which spelt immediate danger to
India. Such a danger had become imminent also
owing to the fact that west and central Asia are
connected to India geographically across
mountain barriers having number of pass. The
nomadic and seminomadic hordes have
constantly tried to enter India through these
mountain passes, attracted by India’s wellwatered plains with fertle soil. extending from
the Punjab to the eastern borders of Bengal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mahmud of Ghazni (997-1030)</i></strong></div>

He was also known as “But-Shikan”
(destroyer of the image) seventeen plundering
expeditions betweened 1000 and 1027 into north
India. Annexing Punjab as his eastern province.
He claimed to have come here with twin
objectives of spreading Islam in India, and
enriching himself by taking away wealth from
India. The contemporary Persian sources
mention that his motive was primarily spreading
Islam and that is why the got the title of Ghazni.
But recent research has provide that a religious
motive was highlighted by him in order to win
over the Caliphiate (Khalifa) at Baghdad and the
real intention of his invasion in India was to loot
the wealth hidden in the garbhagriha of the
Indian temples. The invader’ effective use of the
crossbow while galloping gave them a decisive
advantage over their Indian opponents, the
Rajputs. Mahmud’s conquest of Punjab foretold
ominous consequences for the rest of India.
However, the Rajputs appear to have been both
unprepared and unwilling to change their
military tactics which ultimatly collapsed in the
face of the swift and punitive cavalry of the
Turks. In 1025, he attacked and raided the most
celebrated Hindu temple of Somnat, near the
coast in the extreme south of Kathiawar
(Gujarat). Bhima I, the Chalukyan ruler of
Anhilwara, could not put much resistence and
the temple was looted.
Al Beruni who wrote Kitab-ul Hind, and
firdausi, who wrote Shah Namah, were the court
Historians of Mahmud Ghazni and give a good
account of the polity and society on the eve of
Mahmud’s invasion.
<br>
<br>
In political and military terms, the invasions
of Mahmud of Ghazni were the actual
precursors of the Delhi Sultanate. Beginnning in
1000, when the Shahiya King Jaypala was
routed, the incursion became almost an annual
feature of Mohmud and came to an end only
with his death in 1030. After taking Multan, he
occupied punjab. Later, Mahmed made incursion
into the Ganga-Yamina doab. The major interest
of Mahmud in India was its fabulous wealth,
vast quantities of which (in the form of cash,
jewellery, and golden images) had been deposited
in temples. From 1010 to 1026, the invasions
were thus directed toward the temple-towns of
Thaneswar, Mathura, Kannauj and finally
Somnath. The ultimate result was the
breakdown of Indian resistance, paving the way
for Turkish conquests in the future. More
importantly, the aftermath of the campaigns had
exposed the inadequacy of Indian politics to
offer a united defence against external threats.
Within a short time of Mahmud’s death, his
empire met the fate of other empires. Newly
emerging centres of powers, formed around
growing clusters of Turkish soldier adventurers,
replaced the older ones. The Ghaznavide
pessissions in Khurasasn and Transoxiana were
thus annexed, first by the Seljuqs, and later by
the Khwarizm Shah. In their own homeland,
Afghanistan, their hegemony was brought to an
end by the principlity of Ghor under the
Shansibani dynasty. However, in the midst of
these buffetings, the Ghaznavid rule survived in
punjab and sind till about 1175.
<br>
<br>
Since Indian historians have traced the
Turkish success to the peculiar social structure
created by Islam, Jadunath Sarkar, for instance,
lays stress on the unique characteristic which
Islam imparted to the Arabs, Berbers, Pathnas
and Turks. First, equality and social solidarity
as regards legal and religious status. Unlike
India, the Turks were not divided into castes that
were exclusive of each other. Secondly, and
absolute faith in god and his will which gave
them drive and a sense of mission. Finally, Islam
secured the Turkish conquerors from
drunkenness which, accorkding to Sarkar, was
the ruin of the Rajputas, Marathas, and other
Indian rulers. Whatever partial truth in might
contain, this explanation too seems insufficiently
grounded in history. A more compreshensive
view of the Indian debacle most perhaps had
into account at least two major factors: the
prevailing sociopolitical system in Indian and her
military perparedness.
After the fall of the Gurjark-Pratihara
empire, no single state took its place. Instead,
there arose small independent powers like
Ghadavalas in Kannauj, Parmars in Malva,
chlukyas in Gujarat, Chauhans in Ajmer,
Tomars in Delhi, Chadellas in Bundelkhand, etc.
far from being united, they tended to operate
within the confines of small territories and were
in a state of perpetual internal conflicts. Lack of
centralised power was an important factor in
emasculating the strength and efficiency of the
armed forces. Fakhi Mudhbbir in his AdabulHarb wa-al Shuja’s mentions that Indian forces
consisted of ‘feudal levies’. Each military
contingent was under the command of its
immediate overlora/chief and not that of the
king. Thus, the army lacked ‘unity of command’.
Besides, since only few castes and clans took to
the country; when the Turks came, we find the
indian masses hardly came to the rescue of their
kings. The concept of physical pollution (chhut)
also hampered millitary efficiency since it made
the division of labour impossible; the soldiers had
to do all their work on their own, from fighting
to the fetching of water.
<br>
<br>
Another important reason for the success of
the Turks was their superior miltary technology
and art of war. These nomads could be credited
with introducnig the horses for warfare with
greater skill. The Turks used iron stirrps and
horse shoes that reinforced their striking power
and the stamina of the cavalry. While horse shoes
provided greater mobility to the horse, the stirrup
gave the soldiers a distinct advantage.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Muhammad Ghori (Shahabuddin Muhammad)</i></strong></div>

In AD 1173 Shahabuddin Muhammad (AD
1173–1206) also called Muhammad of Ghor
ascended the throne of Ghazni. The Ghoris were
not strong enough to meet the growing power
and strength of the Khwarizmi Empire; they
realised that they could gain nothing in Central
Asia. This forced Ghori to turn towards India to
fulfil his expansionist ambitions. Muhammad
Ghori was very much interested in establishing
permanent empire in India and not merely
looting its wealth. His campaigns were well
organised and whenever he conquered any
territory, he left a general behind to govern it in
his absence. His invasions resulted in the
permanent establishment of the Turkish
Sultanate in the region lying north of the
Vindhya Mountains.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conquest of Punjab and Sind</i></strong></div>

Muhammad Ghori led his first expedition in
AD 1175. He marched against Multan and freed
it from its ruler. In the same campaign he
captured Uchch from the Bhatti Rajputs. Three
years later in AD 1178 he again marched to
conquer Gujarat but the Chalukya ruler of
Gujarat, Ghima II defeated him at the battle of
Anhilwara. But this defeat did not discourage
Muhammad Ghori. He realised the necessity of
creating a suitable base in Punjab before
venturing on the further conquest of India. He
launched a campaign against the Ghaznavid
possessions in Punjab. As a result Peshawar was
conquered in AD 1179–80 and Lahore in AD
1186. The fort of Sialkot and Debol were
captured next. Thus by AD 1190 having secured
Multan, Sind and Punjab, Muhammad Ghori
had paved the way for a further thrust into the
Gangetic Doab.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ESTABLISHMENT AND EXPANSION OF
THE DELHI SULTANATE</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The First Battle of Tarain (AD 1191)</i></strong></div>

Muhammad Ghori’s possession of Punjab
and his attempt to advance into the Gangetic
Doab brought him into direct conflict with the
Rajput ruler Prithivaraja Chauhan. He had
overrun many small states in Rajputana,
captured Delhi and wanted to extend his control
over Punjab and Ganga valley. The conflict
started with claims of Bhatinda. In the first battle
fought at Tarain in AD 1191, Ghori’s army was
routed and he narrowly escaped death.
Prithviraj conquered Bhatinda but he made no
efforts to garrison it effectively. This gave Ghori
an opportunity to re-assemble his forces and
make preparations for another advance into
India.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Second Battle of Tarain (AD 1192)</i></strong></div>

This battle is regarded as one of the turning
points in Indian History. Muhammad Ghori
made very careful preparations for this conquest.
The Turkish and Rajput forces again came face
to face at Tarain. The Indian forces were more
in number but Turkish forces were well organised
with swift moving cavalry. The bulky Indian
forces were no match against the superior
organisation, skill and speed of the Turkish
cavalry. The Turkish cavalry was using two
superior techniques. The first was the horse shoe
which gave their horses a long life and protected
their hooves. The second was, the use of iron
stirrup which gave a good hold to the horse rider
and a better striking power in the battle. A large
number of Indian soldiers were killed. Prithviraj
tried to escape but was captured near Sarsuti.
The Turkish army captured the fortresses of
Hansi, Sarsuti and Samana. Then they moved
forward running over Delhi and Ajmer.
<br>
<br>
After Tarain, Ghori returned to Ghazni,
leaving the affairs of India in the hand of his
trusted slave general Qutbuddin Aibak. In AD
1194 Muhammad Ghori again returned to India.
He crossed Yamuna with 50,000 cavalry and
moved towards Kanauj. He gave a crushing
defeat to Jai Chand at Chandwar near Kanauj.
Thus the battle of Tarain and Chandwar laid
the foundations of Turkish rule in Northern India.
The political achievements of Muhammad
Ghori in India were long lasting than those of
Mahmud of Ghazni. While Mahmud Ghazni
was mainly interested in plundering Muhammad
Ghori wanted to establish his political control.
His death in AD 1206 did not mean the
withdrawal of the Turkish interests in India. He
left behind his slave General Qutbuddin Aibak
who became first Sultan of the Delhi Sultanate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CULTURAL TRENDS (750-1200)</i></strong></div>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religious Conditions: Importance Of Temples
And Monastic</i></strong></div>

Temples held an important place in the
predominantly agrarian economy of medieval
India, especially in south India. Even though
temples rose to power during the Pallava period,
they gradually consolidated their position under
the Cholas with the help of royal patronage. The
importance of temples was more visible during
the early medieval period largely because of the
fact that land grants during this period were
given more prolifically. During this period we
see the emergence of great royal temples which
symbolised the power of the ruling kingdom.
From the 10th to 13th centuries, a large number
of temples were built in various regional
kingdoms. On account of the royal support and
patronage they received, temples had an access
to agricultural produce and a control of society.
They were also used to counter the divisive forces
prevailing in those kingdoms. Temples flourished
on the landgrants and cash endowments by the
crown, merchant guilds and others which, in
turn, made them the biggest employer, money
lender and consumer of goods and service. Its
social role, based on this economic substructure,
pivoted around its role of preserving and
propagating education and culture.
Sources both archaeological and literary like
Mitakshara, Pratagmanjari and Tahkike Hind,
help a lot to reconstruct the socio-economic role
of temples. All these are corroborated by copper
plates, stone inscriptions and numismatic
findings.
<br>
<br>
Land endowments were the most important
resources of the temples in medieval south India.
The landgranted to the temples had two
functions: first, to yield and income with which
to maintain a specified ritual service in the name
of the donor, and second, to provide a productive
place to invest funds granted to the temples for
the performance of services in the first place, they
increasingly led to an expansion of temple
personnel who were paid in kind or through
allotment of land. This resulted in the growth of
feudal land tenure which is evident from various
epigraphic references to tenants fiscal
concessions and immunities which accompanied
many grants perhaps caused greater economic
bondage of the peasantry and weakened the
central authority.
<br>
<br>
There were various ritual functionaries
attached to temples who were given monetary
endowments by the temple out of their income
from the landgrant and donations from various
quarters. These functionaries included members
of educational institutions (mathas) reciters of
Sanskrit and Tamil sacred works, teachers,
scholars, musicians and poets. They also received
a share of consecrated food offering of the
deities. The economic value of consecrated food
had an important funciton in the endowment
of money to the temple. The secondary
distribution of consecrated food to the devotees
permitted the temple functionaries to resources
of the temple.
Temples also discharged vital responsibilities
towards agricultural development, e.g.,
providing irrigation facilities to agriculturists.
Temples also had economic functions in their
varied roles as landholders, employers, consumer
of goods and services, and banks. They also
discharged the function of money lenders and
depositories. The continuous handling of funds
and receipts of gifts in cash, goods, precious
metals and services gave the temples capital
which the usually reinvested in productive ways.
We have evidences the loans given by temples
to village assemblies for economically productive
purposes. They also granted loans to cultivators,
traders and artisans in reutrn for various articles
given as interest ranging usually between 12.5
percent to 15 percent.
<br>
<br>
As per as the social role of temple is
concerned, they were the centre of activity as
assemblies and schools. Caste consciousness had
become a marked feature with the society divided
vertically between the Brahmanas and the nonBrahmanas. The medium of education in the
temples was sanskrit. Debates were held in
various mathas and colleges regarding
philophical aspects of Hindu theology.
Sankaracharya’s ideas continued to be developer
and improved upon and theories and
philosophies of other teachers were also
discussed. It is to be noted that Ramanuja, the
famous Vaishnava philosopher, spent a
favourable part of his life teaching at the famous
temple of Shrirangam.
<br>
<br>
Thus, temples in medieval India, specially in
south India, had developed some sort of tourist
industry lide in modern times. Pilgrims flocked
to temples during the festivals (which were quite
frequent) in huge numbers, and hence, these
necessitated employment to guilds, priests, innkeepers, food-shelters etc. In effect, they become
miniature towns.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sankaracharya</i></strong></div>

Sankaracharya was a Nambudiri Brahman
born in Kaladi, Malabar. He was originally a
worshiper of Seva. He gave an entirely new turn
to the Hindu revival movement by providing it
with a solid philosophical background through
the reinterpretation of ancient Indian scriptures,
particularly the Upanishads. Sankaracharya
advocated the philosophy of “Advaita” the
monism of the Vedanta by giving a brilliant
exposition to the entire range of the Vedic
religions and spiritual thought. Having lost his
father in his childhood, Sankaracharya become
a sanyasi, while in his teens and began to roam
about in search of true knowledge and wisdom.
A genius by birth and intensely religious by
outlook and social heritage, he received
instruction in religious scriptures and philosophy
at Kashi. Sankaracharya renewed and
systematised Vedanta philosophy by stressing on
its main principle of monism (advaita or absolute
non-dualism). Sankaracharya started a vigorous
campaign for the revial of Hinduism based on
the solid foundation of Vedic philosophy and
ancient Indian cultural tradition in order to
check the growth of Buddhism and Jainism. He
recognised the ascetic order of sanyasis on the
pattern of Buddhist sangha and launched a
campaign for the popularisation of Hinduism.
He composed extensive commentaries on the
Brahmasutra and chief upanishad and traveled
all around India to highlight the cultural unity
of India. The mathas also began propagating the
centre of Vedic religion. The mathas, among
many, included Jaganathpuri in the east, Sringeri
in the South, Dwarka in the west and Badrinath
in the north.
<br>
<br>
Sankaracharya was an orthodox Brahmin
for whom the Vedic literature was sacred and
unquestionably true. In order to harmonise the
many paradoxes of Vedic tradition, that had to
trade recourse to a philosophy of “double
standard of truth” (already known in
Buddhism). It meant that on the every day level
of truth, the world was preduce by Brahma, and
it went through an evolutionary process similar
to that taught by the Sankhya school of
philosophy. But on the highest level of truth, the
whole universe including the God was unreal,
i.e., the world in maya, an illusion and figment
of imagination. Therefore, Shankarcharya
believed that ultimately the only reality was the
Brahman, the impersonal world soul of the
Upanishads with which the individual soul was
identical.
<br>
<br>
Sankaracharya also believed that god and the
created world was one and the difference which
is evident is due to ignorance. According to him,
the way to salvation was to realise by means of
meditation and knowledge that god and the
created beings were one and the some. At the
deepest level of meditation “nirvikalpa
samadhi”, the complete identity between god
and the individual is realised. It is the goal of
everyone to know, realise, feel and display in
action this identity. When this is accomplished
all sufferings and births and deaths cease. This
identity has been termed as “ sachidanand
Brahman” by Sankaracharya.
Sankaracharya’s ‘Brahman’ is not really
different from the concept of ‘nirvana’ of
Mahayana Buddhism. It is a fact which was wellrecognised by his opponents who called him
“crypto-Buddhist.” However, Shankarcharya
proved the Buddhist scholars wrong and was
able to show that Buddhist metaphysics was
only a poor imitation of the metaphysics of
snatan dharma.
<br>
<br>
The philosophy of Sankaracharya had far
reaching consequences for the India society. For
example the monastic Sankaracharya (mathas)
which he established in the four corners of India
served as an effective step towards the physical
and spiritual unification of India. By Jainism but
his real greatness lies in his brilliant dialectic. By
the able use arguements he reduced all the
apparently self-contradicting passages of the
Upanishads to a consistent system which has
remained the standard of Hinduism to this day,
Sankaracharaya passed away at Kedar Nath at
the age of 32 Ramanuja combined Sankara’s
Advaitavada with the Vaishnava Pancharatra
theology which claimed that Vishnu is the very
foundation of the universe. The impact of
Ramanuja’s writings and his long service as
priest of the fomous Vishnu temple at Srinangam
made his ideas widely known among the
Vaishnavites and he is justly regarded as the
founder of Srivashnavism. The Vedantic
Philosophy of Sankaracharya was revived
Vivekanand in the second half of the 19th century.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sufism</i></strong></div>

Sufism or tasawwuf is the name for various
mystical and movements in Islam. It aims at
establishing direct communion between god and
man through personal experience of mystery
which lies within Islam. Every religion gives rise
to mystical tendencies is its fold at a particular
stage of its evolution. In this sense, Sufism was a
natural development within Islam based on the
spirit of Quaranic Piety. The Sufis while
accepting the shariat did not confine their
religious practice to formal adherence and
stressed cultivation of religious experience aimed
at a direct perception of god.
There developed a number of Sufi orders of
silsilah in and outside India. All these orders had
their specific characteristics. However, there
were a number of features which are common
to all Sufi orders.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sufism as it developed in the Islamic
world came to stress the importance of
traversing the Sufi path (tariqa) as a
method of establishing direct
communion with divine reality
(haqiqat).</li>
        <li>According to the Sufi beliefs, the novice
has to pass through a succession of
“stations” of “stages” (maqamat) and
changing psychological conditions or
“states” (hal) to experience god.</li>
        <li>The sufi path could be traversed only
under the strict supervision of a spiritual
director (sheikh, pir or murshid) who
had himself successfully traversed and
consequently established direct
communion with god.</li>
        <li>the disciple (murid) progressed through
the “stages” and “states” by practising
such spiritual exercise as self-mortification, recollection of god’s name 
to attain concentration (zikr) and contemplation.</li>
        <li>The sufis organised impassioned musical recitals (soma). The practice of sama
was intended to induce a mystical state
of ecstasy. However, some sufi orders
did not approve of certain forms of sama
and the ulema were particularly hostile
to the practice.</li>
        <li>Yet another feature of sufism is the
organisation of the Sufis into vatious
orders (silsilah). Each of these silsilah,
e.g. suhrawardi, qadiri, chishti, weer
founded by a leading figure who lent
his name to it. A silsilah consisted of
persons who had become disciples of a
particular Sufi.</li>
        <li>The hospice (dhanqah) was the centre
of the activities of a sufi order. It was
the place where the pir imparted
spiritual training to his disciples. The
popularity of the khanqah and its
capacity fo attract disciples depended
on the reputation of the pir. Khanqahs
were supported by endowment and
charity.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



By the time the various Sufi orders began
their activities in India from the beginning of the
13th century, Sufism had already grown into a
full-fledge movement in different parts of the
Islamic world. Sufism acquired distinct
characteristics in the Indian environment but its
growth in India, particularly in the initial phase,
was linked in many ways with the development
that occurred in Sufi beliefs and practice in the
Islamic world during the period between 17th
and 13th centuries. The growth of Sufism in the
central lands of islam during this period can be
divided into three broad phases.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GROWTH OF SUFISM IN
ISLAMIC WORLD</i></strong></div>

The Formative Stage (Upto 10th Century)
Early Sufis applied an esoteric meaning to
verses in the quran which stressed on such
virtues as repentance (tauba), abstinence,
renunciation, poverty, trust in god (gawakkul)
etc. Mecca, Madin, Basra, and Kufa were the
earliest centres of Sufism. Sufism at Basra
reached its height during the time of the woman
mystic Rabia. Other regions of the Islamic world
where Sufism spread to Iranian regions, it
tended to express greater individualism,
divergent tendencies, and heterodox doctrines
and practices under Persian influence. The most
famous of the early Sufis in the Iranian regions
was Bayazid Bistami from Dhurasan. In
Baghdad, Al junaid was the most well-known
of the early Sufis. Al junaid won the approval of
the Islamic orthodoxy and represented the
controlled and disciplined side of Sufism and,
therfore, those Sufis who followed his line are
regarded as sober. Both Junaid and Bistami
exercised profound influences on their
contemporary and later Sufis. Two contrasting
tendencies initiated by them come to be
distinguished as Junaidi and Bistami, or Iraqi and
Dhurasani,
<br>
<br>
Another prominents early sufi from Baghdad
was Mansur al-Hallaj who started his career as
pupil of Al Junaid but later developed the method
of Bayazid Bistami. His mystical formula “I am
god” played an important role in the evolution
of Sufi ideas in Iran and then in India. The Ulema
considered, imprisoned and finally hanged. His
ideas provided the basis for the development of
the doctrine of “Insane-i-kamil” (the perfect
man).


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Growth of the Organised Sufi Movement
(10th-12th Century)</i></strong></div>

Sufism began to acquire the form of an
organised movement with the establishment of
the Turkish rule under the Ghaznavis and then
under the Seljuqs in various parts of central Asia
and Iran in the later 10th and 11th centuries.
The period marks the development of two
parallel institutions in the Islamic world-the
madarasa system (seminary, higher religious
school) in its new form as an official institution
of orthodox Islamic learning and the Khanqah
system as an ogranised, endowed an permanent
centre for Sufi activities.
<br>
<br>
This stage is also characterised by the
appearance of Sufi literary texts which argued
and codified the Sufi ideas and doctrines. AlGhazzali was the most outstanding sufi author.
One of the most authentic and celebrated manual
of sufism was Kashful Mahjub written by AlHujwiri.
Another salient feature of Sufism during this
period was the emergence of Sufi poetry in
Persian. While Arabic literature on mysticism is
in prose, Persian literature is in poetry. Sufi
poetry in Persian in the form of narrative poems
(mannavis) reached its peak during the 12th and
13th centuries.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Formation of Sufi Orders of Silsilah (Late
12th and 13th Centuries)</i></strong></div>

Few decades before Sufism began to exercise
an influence on Indian society and religious life,
organised Sufi movement reached its peak in the
Islamic world in the form of various tariqa (paths)
or Sufi orders. These orders began to crystallise
when, from the end of the 12th century, each
one of the Sufi entries began to perpetuate the
name of one particular master and his spiritual
ancestry and focused on its own tariqa consisting
of peculiar practices and chain through which
successive spiritual heirs (khalifa) traced their
spiritual inheritance to the founder of the order.
The founders of various silsilahs accepted the
Islamic law and ritual practices of Islam. The
link between orthodox Islam and silsila founders
is also clear from the fact that many of the latter
were professional Sufists. However, the gave an
esoteric orientation to orthodox Islamic rituals
and introduced many innovation, particularly
in their religious practices, which were not
always in consonance with the orthodox outlook.
Though the silsilah founders laid emphasis on
strict adherence to Islamic law, many silsilahs
later did develop many heterodox beliefs and
practies.
<br>
<br>
The silsilahs which become popular in Iran,
central Asia and Baghdad, played a significant
role in the growth of sufism in various parts of
the Islamic world including the suhrawardi
founded by shaidh Shahabuddin Suhrawardk;
the Qadiri formed by Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani,
the Dhawajagan, but later came to be associated
with the name of Bahauddin Naqshbandi. The
Sufies who had received their training in these
silsilahs began to establish their branches in their
countries or in new countries such as India.
Gradually, these branches become independent
Sufi schools with own characteristics and
tendencies.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LITERATURE AND SCIENCE</i></strong></div>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Under the Cholas</i></strong></div>

Education based on the epics and the
Puranas was imparted during this time through
discourses in temples. There colleges and other
institutions for higher education. The period was
marked by the growth of Tamil classics such as
Sibakasindamani, Kamban’s Ramayana, and
others. Very few books were composed in
Sanskrit, Rajaraja I was the subject of two worksadrama (Rajarajesvara Natakam) and a kavya
(Rajaraja Vijayam).
<br>
<br>
Under the Chalukyas of Kalyani
The Chaludya period withnessed a
phenomenal growth in literature, both in
Sanskrit and Kannada. Among the sanskrit
writers of the period, the foremost in Bihana, the
court poet of Vidramaditya VI. Vidramankacharita of Bihana is a mahakavaya. Bihana wrote
many other works. The great jurist Vijramaditya,
wrote the famous Mitaksara, a commentary on
the Yanjavalkya Smriti, Somesvara III was the
author of encyclopadedic work, Manasollasa or
Abhilashitarha-chintamani.
<br>
<br>
Under the western Chalukyas, kannada
Literature reached great heights. The three
Literary gems, Pampa, Ponna and Ranna,
contributed to the development of Kannada
literature in the 10th century. Of the three,
Ranna was the court poet of Satyasraya, while
the other two belonged to earlier decades.
Nagavarma I was another poet of fame. He was
the author of Chandombudhi, the ocean of
prosody, the earliest work on the subject in
Kannada. He also wrote karnataka-kandambari
which is based on Bana’s celebrated romance in
Sanskrit. The next writer of note was Dugasimha,
a minister under Jayasimha II, who wrote
Anchatantra. The Veer Saina mystics, especially
Basava, contributed to the development of
Kannada language and literature, particular
prose literature. They brought into existence the
Vachana Literature to convey high philosophical
ideas to the common man in simple language.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Under the Yadavas</i></strong></div>

The Senas gave a great impetus to the
development of Sanskrit Literature. The family
of the famous astronomer and mathematician
Bhasdaracharya belonged to this period.
Bhaskaracharya’s father, Mahesvari (known as
kavisvara), wrote two works on astrology,
Sekhara and Laghutika. Of the numerous works
of Bhaskaracharya, the most famous are
Siddhanta Siromani (composed in 1150) and
Karanakuthuhala, the first being the best treatise
on algebra to be found in Sanskrit Literature. His
son Lakshmidhara and his grandson
Changadeva were the court astrologers of jaitugi
and Simhana respectively. Bhaskaracharya’s
grand-nephew Anantadeva, a protege of
Simhana, was a master of the three branches of
astronomy and wrote a commentary on the
Brihat Jataka of Varahaminira and also on one
chapter of Brahmasphuta Siddhana of
Brahmagrupta.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Under the kakatiyas</i></strong></div>

The kakatiya rules extended liberal
patronage to Sanskrit. Several eminent Sanskrit
writers and poets authored inscriptions which
must be regarded as kavyas in miniature. Of
these writers, Achinterdra was commissioned by
Rudradeva to compose the Prasati embodies in
the Anumakonda inscription.
Telugu literature also flourished in the
Kakatiya Kingdom. Several inscriptions were
composed party or wholly in Telugu verse, like
the inscriptions at Gudur of (Beta II), karimnagar
(Gangakhara), Upparapalle (Kata) and
Konnidena (Opilisiddhi). The new religious
movement led Vaishnavism and Virasaivism
gave a great impetus to Telugu literature. Several
works on the two great national epics, the
Ramayana and the Mahabharata.
begun by Nannayuabnhatta in the 11th
century AD, was completed by Tikkana
Somayaji, the minister and poet Laureate of the
Telugu Chola King Manuma siddhi II of Nellre
in the middle of the 13th century AD.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Alberuni's India</i></strong></div>

Abu’l Rayan Alberuni was a philosopher
scientist, whose Ditab al Hind was the first and
most important discussion on Indian sciences,
religion and society by an outsider. He was not
just a historian. His Knowledge and interest
covered many other areas such as astronomy,
geography, logic, medicine, mathematics,
philosophy, religion and theology, He was
probably born in 973 AD. He was attached to
Mahmud’s court and accompanied him to India
during various raids.
Alberuni’s Kitab al Hind or Tahkik-i Hind is
the survey of Indian based on his study and
observations in India between 1017 and 1030.
To get a proper grip of the situation, he learned
Sanskrit so that he might go to the sources of
Hindu thought and religion. He learnt Sanskrit
to acquire first hand information. He read the
religion texts and met the learned Indians.
His approach was scientific and religious
prejudices do not mar the quality of his
observations. He quoted form the Bhagavat Gita,
Bishnu Puran, Kapil’s Sankhya and the work of
Patanjali. Alberuni’s observation of Indian
society can be studied under six major sub-heads:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Caste-ridden society</li>
        <li>Closed society</li>
        <li>Stagnant knowledge</li>
        <li>social evils</li>
        <li>Religious beliefs</li>
        <li>Scientific knowledge.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Caste-ridden Society</i></strong></div>

The complete caste structure of Indian society
did not go unnoticed by Alberuni. One notable
observation of Alberuni was that the Vaishyas
were also fast degeneration to the rank of
Sudras. He notes the absence of any significant
difference between the Vaishyas and the sudras,
who lived together in the same town and village
and mixed together in the same house. By the
11th century it seems that the Vaishyas come to
be treated as Sudras virtually and legally. The
alliance of convenience between the Brahmanas
and the ruling Kshatriyas was a fact that
Alberuni refers to indirectly. He also refers to a
class of untouchables which existed in the society
called antyaja. Alberuni lists eight antyaja castes
below the status of the Sudras. Some of the names
of untouchable castes that are mentioned by him
are: Bhodhatu, Bhedas, Chandala, Doma, and
Hodi.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Closed Society</i></strong></div>

The closed attitude of society, lacking
dynamism did not go untouched by Alberuni.
He informs us that traveling to far off places was
considered by the Brahmins. The area within
which a Brahmana could live was fixed and a
Hindu was not generally permitted to enter the
land of the Turks. All this makes sense in the
context of “feudal localism” which ruled out or
other types of connection between one region of
the country and another.
Alberuni further says that the isolationist
attitude of Indians was further buttressed by a
false sense of superiority. In his opening chapter
itself alberuni writers that the Indians belived
that there is no country like theirs, no nation like
theirs, no king like theirs, no religion like theirs,
no science like theirs, no science like theirs.” The
Indian are by nature niggardly in communication
what they know and they do not believe in
exchange of ideas. They had the greatest possible
care to with hold their knowledge from men of
another caste, from among their own people,
and even more from nay outsider.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Stagnant Knowledge</i></strong></div>

It is indeed unfortunate that Alberuni visited
India at a time when knowledge was at a low
ebb. While the rich heritage of the past
knowledge is highlighted by Alberuni when he
refers to the various ‘sidhantas’ and the progress
made in astronomy and mathematics, but he
paints a very pathetic picture of the 11th century,
He says “The Indians are in a state of utter
confusion, devoid of any logical order, and they
always mix up with silly notions of the crowd.I
can only compare their mathematical and
astronomical knowledge to a mixture of pearls
and sour dates. Both kind of things are equal in
their eyes since they cannot raise themselves to
the method of a strictly scientific deduction.”

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Evils</i></strong></div>

Alberuni mentions evil social practices
within the Indian society like child-marriage,
sati, the low position of women in general and
widows in particular. He mentions that Hindus
marry at a very young age, If a wife loses her
husband due to death she cannot remarry, A
widow has only two options, either the remain
a widow as long as she lives, or to burn herself
(sati). The latter option was generally preferred
because as a widow she was ill-treated.
Religious Beliefs and Practices
Alberuni, who had carefully studied the
Hindu religion’s philosophy and institutions,
found no difficulty in marking out the trinity
gods (three deities of the Hindu religion) and
philosophy of the Upanishads. He says that the
belief in a multitude of gods is vulgar and is a
typical of the un-educated. Educated Hindus
believe god to be one and Eternal. Hindus
considered the existence of god as real. because
everything that exists, exists through god.
Alberuni had also learned all about the
Hindu concept of transmigration of soul. He
explains that Indians believed that every act of
this life will be rewarded or punished in the life
to com, and the final emancipation of a human
being is possible only through true knowledge,
He terms all these beliefs of the Indian as narrowmindedness. He says that insularity at every level
was the characteristic feature of India in the 11th
century and the price of this insularity was the
disruption of the country be the coming of the
Turks.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Scientific Knowledge and legal System</i></strong></div>

Although Alberuni is critical of the scientific
knowledge of Indians, sometimes he has praised
their knowledge. He made great effort to
understand the Indian legal system. He notes
every practical aspect of the legal system and
points out the difference between these and the
legal theories as expounded in the law books like
Manusmriti. He also praises the weights and
measure system and distance measurement
system of Indians. He also notices the many
variations of the Indian alphabets. He provides
interesting geographical data and takes into
account local astronomical and mathematical
theories.
<br>
<br>
While making his profound observation,
Alberuni, did not pay a partisan role and
condemned Mahmud Ghazni’s destructive
activities. He was perhaps the first Muslim to
have undertaken the study of Indian society on
such a major scale.
Where Alberuni was not very sure of his own
knowledge, he frankly admitted it. His critical
assessment of Indian customs and ways of life,
festivals, ceremonies is particularly interesting.
He says that the fact that Indians had started
depending on tradition heavily was a hindrance
to genuine intellectual quest. He felt that learning
and scientific spirit suffered because they had
been sub-ordained to religion.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Art And Architecture</i></strong></div>

The Cholas continued and developed the art
tradition of the Pallavas and pandyas, whom
they succeeded. During the nearly four certuries
long rule, the entire Tamil country was studded
with temples and Chola art traditional were
adopted and followed in Sri Lanka and other
parts of south India. The replacement of brick
by stone structure went on steadily under the
cholas. The chief features of Chola temples are
their massive vimanas of towers and spacious
courtyards. In the Brihadeswara of Rajarajesvara
temple, dedicated to Siva, the vimana of tower
is about 57 metres high upon a square, comprising
thirteen successive storeys. It is crowned by a
single block of granite, 7.5 metres high and about
80 tonnes in weight. Similarly, Rajendra I
erected a splendid temple at his new capital,
Gangakonda Cholapram. Some Chola temples
at Thanjavur and Kalahasti contain beautiful
protrait images of royal personages, like those
of Rajaraja I and his queen Lodamahadevi and
of Rajendra I and his queen Cholamahadevi,
The Cholas also encouraged plastic art; the metal
and stone images cast during the period are
exquisitely executed and display a wounderful
givour, dignity and grace. The masterpiece of
chola sculpture is the famous Nataraja of the
dancing Siva image at the great temple of
Chidambaram. Numerous such images were also
moulded in bronze. This Nataraja has been
described as the “cultural epitome” of the chola
period. The Cholas also patronised painting. Of
the Chola paintings, the most important are those
in the pradakshina passage of the Rajarajesvara
temple.
<br>
<br>
Temple architecutre, particularly the
Dravida or south Indian style of architecture,
reached the pinnacle of glory under the Cholas.
The chief feature of a Chola temple is the vimana
or the story, which was later eclipsed by the
richly ornamented gopuram of gateway. Under
the Cholas, temples became the centre of life,
particularly in the rural areas. The village
assembly invariably held its meetings in the
temple mandapas, which became an additional
feature of the Chola temple architecture.
The best example is, the Siva or the
Brihadesvara of the Rajarajesvara temple, built
in 1009 by Rajaraja I. Tanjore. It is a fitting
memorial to the material achievements of the
Cholas under Rajaraja I. Apart from being the
tallest (216 feet) of all Indian temples of the
medieval period, it is a masterpiece of south
Indian architecture. In this temple, a carving of
a man’s head with a European hat is found on
one side of the temple (in a subsidiary structure),
which is believed to be that of Marco Polo (late
13th century), the Venetian traveler, The temple
of Gangaikonda Cholapurm (also dedicated to
Siva or Brihadesvara), the creation of Rajendra
I, was meant to excel its predecessor in every
conceivable way. Erected around 1030, the
greater elaboration in its appearance attested to
the more affluent state of the chola empire under
Rajendra I. It is larger in plan though not as tall
as the previous one.
<br>
<br>
The Chola period also witnessed great strides
in the field of sculpure. The three main classes
of Chola sculpture are portraits, icons and
decorative sculptures.
There are three well-preserved and nearly
life-size portraits on the walls of the
Duranganatha temple at Srinivasanallyur, and
several others in the Nagesvara temple at
Kumbhakonam. The Chola sculptors started
bronze-casting sometime around the middle of
the 9th century. The Cholas are particularly
known for their Nataraja bronzes (bronze
statues of Nataraja of the dancing Siva) which
are master pieces of this Nagesvara temple at
Dumbhakonam. A group of three bronzes of
Rama, Lakshmana and Sita wth Hanuman at
their feet from Tirkkadaiyur (Tanjore District) is
one of the finest products of Chola bronzemarking of the reign of Rajaraja I.
Chola wall paintings are to be found on the
walls of the Vijayala Cholesvara and
Rajarajesvara temples. On the walls of the
Vijalaya Cholesvara temple, large painted figures
of Mahakala, Devi and Siva are still visible.
The Hoysalas were also great patrons of art.
In many cases, the Hoysala temples are not single
but double, having all essential parts duplicated.
One more noteworthy feature is that the temple
itself appears to be the work of a sculptor and
not of a builder, This is best illustrated in the
Hoysalesvara temple at Halebid, whose plinth
consists of nine bands and each band had
thousands of decorative figures in various
postures. Hence, the Hoysala temples have been
aptly described as sculptors’ architecture. There
are a number of temples in the Mysore territory
which exhibit amazing display of sculptural
exuberance. The most typical and well-known
examples are the temples of Desava at
Simnathpur, Chenna Desava at Belur and
Hoysalesvara at Halebid. The Keasva at
Simnathpur, Chenna Kesava at Belur and
Housalesvara at Halebid. The Desava temple at
Somnathpur, near Seringapatnam erected about
1268, is still in a perfect state.
The other major centers of Dravida style are
Mammallapuram (Mahabalipuram) with the
seven pagodas, kailashnath and Vaikuntah Perumal temples at Kanchi, and Parshurameshvar
temple at Gudimallam.
<br>
<br>
The temples of Orissa represent the Nagara
style of architecture. Few of the famous temples
built during 7th and 13th centuries include
Lingaraja temple at Bhuvaneshwar, Jagannath
temple at Puri and Sun temple at Konark. The
temples built by Chandel rulers at Khajurago
between 950 and 1050 are also famous for their
architectural beauty.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contact With Southeast Asia</i></strong></div>

Indians have been moving out from ancient
time to different parts of the world for trade and
other activities. As far as the Indian contact with
Southeast Asia is concerned, it appears to be as
old as fifth century B.C. Jatakas the Buddhist
texts belonging to this period refer to Indians
visiting Suvarnadvipa (island of gold), which is
identified with Java. Such early contacts with
Southeast Asia are confirmed by the recent
archeological finds of pearls and ornaments of
agate and carnelian, the semi-precious stones of
Indian origin, from the coastal sites in Thailand,
Vietnam, Indonesia, etc. These finds belong to
as far back as first century BC. According to the
Chinese traditions, the first kingdom in South
east Asia was founded at Funan (Cambodia) in
the fourth century AD by a brahman known as
Kaundinya who had come from India and had
married the local princess. However, Indian and
Southeast Asian contacts became closer from 5th
century AD onwards when inscriptions in
Sanskrit language start appearing in many areas.
It reached its peak during AD 800–AD 1300
when many kings and dynasties with Indian
names emerge all over Southeast Asia The
Southeast contact was largely on account of
trade. Southeast Asia is rich in cardamom,
sandal wood, camphor, cloves etc. which formed
important items of trade between India and the
West. Initially, the Indian traders appear to have
settled along the coast, but gradually they shifted
their network to the interior. Along with the
traders came the priests particularly the
Buddhist and brahmanas, to meet the ritual
requirements of the Indian settlers. It thus
created a situation for the spread of Indian social
and cultural ideas in South east Asia. But it must
be noted that Indian contact did not uproot the
local culture. It was rather a case of peaceful
intermixing of Indian concepts with local
cultural features. 
<br>
<br>
Therefore, for example, while
Sanskrit was accepted as a language of court and
religion in Southeast Asia the regional languages
continued to be used side by side , and we find
many inscriptions in mixed Sanskrit and local
language. Similarly, the concept of varna was
known to the south east Asians and brahmanas
were respected in society, but social divisions
were not rigid as it was in India.
The most important empire which come to
be founded in South east Asia in the 8th Century
AD was the Shailendra empire. It comprised
Java, Sumatra, Malay- Pennisula and other parts
of the Southeast Asian region. They were a
leading naval power and on account of their
geographical position controlled the trade
between China and India as well as other
countries in the west. The Shailendra kings were
followers of Buddhism and had close contact
with the Indian rulers. One of the kings of this
empire, built a monastery at Nalanda in the ninth
century, and at his request the Pala king
Devapala of Bengal granted five villages for its
upkeep. Similarly in the eleventh century
another king was permitted by the Chola king
Rajaraja I to build a Buddhist monastery at
Nagapattam on the Tamil Coast. The Shailendras
also built a beautiful temple dedicated to Buddha
at Barabudur in Java. It is situated on the top of
a hillock and consists of nine gradually receding
terraces.

Besides Buddhism, the worship of Hindu
gods such as Vishnu and Siva was also quite
popular in southeast Asia. The temples dedicated
to them have been found at various places. They
show distinct traces of Indian influence and
inspiration. One of the most famous temples,
dedicated to Vishnu, is Angkorvat temple built
in the 12th century by Surya Varman II, the king
of Kambuja (Cambodia). It is surrounded by a
moat, filled with water. It has a huge gopuram
(gateway) and number of galleries, the walls of
which are decorated with sculptures based on
themes drawn from Mahabharat and
Ramayana.
