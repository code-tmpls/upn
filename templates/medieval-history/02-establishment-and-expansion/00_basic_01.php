<h3>Establishment and Expansion of The Delhi Sultanate</h3>


The rulers who ruled substantial parts of the
North India between AD1200 to AD1526 were
termed as Sultans and the period of their rule as
the Delhi Sultanate. These rulers were of Turkish
and Afghan origin. They established their rule
in India after defeating the Indian ruling
dynasties which were mainly Rajputs in
northern India. The main ruler who was
overthrown by the invading Turk Muhammad
Ghori from Delhi was Prithvi Raj Chauhan.
These Sultans ruled for more than 300 years (from
around AD 1200 to AD 1526). The last of the
Delhi Sultan, Ibrahim Lodi was defeated by the
Mughals under the leadership of Babur in
AD1526 who established the Mughal Empire in
India. During this period of around three
hundred years five different dynasties ruled
Delhi. These were the Mamluks (AD 1206–AD
1290) (popularly known as slave dynasty), the
Khaljis (AD 1290–AD 1320), the Tughlaqs (AD
1320–AD 1412), the Sayyids (AD 1412–AD 1451)
and the Lodis (AD 1451– AD 1526). All these
dynasties are collectively referred as the Delhi
Sultanate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE MAMLUK SULTANS</i></strong></div>

With Qutbuddin Aibak, begins the period of
Mamluk Sultans or the slave dynasty. Mamluk
is an Arabic word meaning “owned”. It was
used to distinguish the imported Turkish slaves
meant for military service from the lower slaves
used as domestic labour or artisan. The Mamluk
Sultans ruled from AD 1206 to 1290.
• Qutbuddin Aibak (AD 1206–1210)
Qutbuddin Aibak was a Turkish slave who
had risen to high rank in Muhammad Ghori’s
army. After Muhammad Ghori’s death in AD
1206, the control of his Indian possessions was
passed on to Qutbuddin Aibak. Aibak was the
first independent Muslim ruler of Northern
India, the founder of Delhi Sultanate.
Aibak had to face many revolts from Rajputs
and other Indian chiefs. Tajuddin Yaldauz, the
ruler of Ghazni, claimed his rule over Delhi.
Nasiruddin Qabacha, the governor of Multan
and Uchch aspired for independence. Aibak was
able to win over his enemies by conciliatory
measures as well as a display of power. He
defeated Yaldauz and occupied Ghazni. The
successor of Jaichand, Harishchandra had
driven out the Turks from Badayun and
Farukhabad. Aibak re-conquered both Badayun
and Farukhabad.
<br>
<br>
Qutbuddin Aibak was brave, faithful and
generous. Due to his generosity he was known
as “Lakh Baksh”. Most of the scholars consider
Aibak as the real founder of Mulsim rule in India.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Iltutmish (AD 1210–1236)</i></strong></div>

In AD 1210, Aibak died of injuries received
in a fall from his horse while playing chaugan
(Polo). After his death a few amirs raised his son
Aram Shah to the throne in Lahore. But Aram
Shah was incapable ruler and the Turkish amirs
opposed him. The Turkish chiefs of Delhi invited
the governor of Badayun (son-in-law of
Qutbuddin Aibak) “Iltutmish” to come to Delhi.
Aram Shah proceeded against him at the head
of the army from Lahore to Delhi but Iltutmish
defeated him and became the Sultan with the
name of Shamsuddin. The credit of consolidating
the Delhi Sultanate lies largely with him. When
Iltutmish ascended the throne, he found himself
surrounded with many problems. Other
commanders of Muhammad Ghori like Yaldauz,
Qubacha and Ali Mardan rose in defiance again.
The chief of Jalor and Ranthambore joined
Gwalior and Kalinjar in declaring their
independence. Apart from this, the rising power
of Mongols under Chenghiz Khan threatened
the North West Frontier of the Sultanate.
Iltutmish took up the task of consolidating
his position. He defeated Yaldauz in AD 1215
in the battle of Tarain. In AD 1217 he drove away
Qabacha from Punjab. In AD 1220, when
Chenghiz Khan destroyed the Khwarizm expire,
Iltutmish realised the rpolitical necessity of
avoiding a confrontation with the Mongols. Thus
when Jalaluddin Mangbarani, the son of the
Shah of Khwarizm, while escaping from the
Mongols, sought shelter at Iltutmish’s court,
Iltutmish turned him away. He thus saved the
Sultanate from destruction by the Mongols.
From AD 1225 onwards, Iltutmish engaged
his armies in suppressing the disturbances in the
East. In AD 1226–27 Iltutmish sent a large army
under his son Nasiruddin Mahmud which
defeated Iwaz Khan and brought Bengal and
Bihar back into the Delhi Sultanate. Similarly a
campaign was also launched against the Rajput
chiefs. Ranthambore was captured in AD 1226
and by AD 1231 Iltutmish had established his
authority over Mandor, Jalore, Bayana and
Gwalior.
<br>
<br>
There is no doubt that Iltutmish completed
the unfinished work of Aibak. The Delhi
Sultanate now covered a sizeable territory.
Besides this, he also organised his trusted nobles
or officers into a group of “Forty” (Turkan-iChahalgani). He was a farsighted ruler and he
consolidated and organised the newly formed
Turkish Sultanate in Delhi. Iltutmish established
‘Group of Forty’ (Turkan-i-Chahalgani). These
were Turkish amirs (nobles) who advised and
helped the Sultan in administering the Sultanate.
After the death of Iltutmish, this group assumed
great power in its hands. For a few years they
decided on the selection of Sultans one after the
other. The group was finally eliminated by
Balban.
<br>
<br>
Iltutmish effectively suppressed the defiant
amirs of Delhi. He separated the Delhi Sultanate
from Ghazni, Ghor and Central Asian politics.
Iltutmish also obtained a ‘Letter of Investiture’
in AD 1229 from the Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad
to gain legitimacy. Iltutmish made a significant
contribution in giving shape to administrative
institution such as iqtas, army and currency
system. He gave the Sultanate two of its basic
coins– the silver ‘Tanka’ and the copper ‘Jittal’.
To affect greater control over the conquered
areas Iltutmish granted iqtas (land assignments
in lieu of cash salaries) to his Turkish officers on
a large scale. The recipients of “iqtas” called the
“iqtadars” collected the land revenue from the
territories under them. Out of this they
maintained an armed contingent for the service
of the state, enforced law and order and met
their own expenses. Iltutmish realized the
economic potentiality of the Doab and the iqtas
were distributed mainly in this region. This
secured for Iltutmish the financial and
administrative control over one of the most
prestigious regions of North India. (You will read
details of administration in lesson 12)


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Raziya (AD 1236–40)</i></strong></div>

The problem of successor troubled Iltutmish
during his last days. Iltutmish did not consider
any of his sons worthy of the throne. His own
choice was his daughter Raziya hence he
nominated her as his successor. But after his
death his son Ruknuddin Firoz ascended the
throne with the help of army leaders. However
with the support of the people of Delhi and some
military leaders, Raziya soon ascended the
throne. Despite her obvious qualities, Raziya did
not fare significantly better primarily because of
her attempts to create a counter nobility of nonTurks and invited the wrath of the Turkish
amirs. They were particularly incensed over her
decision to appoint the Abyssinian, Malik
Jamaluddin Yaqut, as the amir-i-akhur (master
of the horses); the recruitment of a few other
non-Turks to important posts further inflamed
matters. The nobility realized that, though a
woman, Raziya was not willing to be a puppet
in their hands, therefore the nobles started
revolting against her in the provinces. They
accused her of violating feminine modesty and
being too friendly to an Abbyssinian noble,
Yaqut. She got killed after she was defeated by
the nobles. Thus her reign was a brief one and
came to end in AD 1240.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nasiruddin Mahmud (1246–66 AD)</i></strong></div>

The struggle for power between Sultan and
the Turkish Chiefs “Chahalgani” which began
during the reign of Raziya continued. After
Raziya’s death, the power of Chahalgani
increased and they became largely responsible
for making and unmaking of kings. Behram Shah
(AD 1240–42) and Masud Shah (AD 1242–46)
were made Sultans and removed in succession.
After them, in AD 1246, Ulugh Khan (later
known as Balban) placed the inexperienced and
young Nasiruddin (grandson of Iltutmish) on
throne and himself assumed the position of Naib
(deputy). To further strengthen his position, he
married his daughter to Nasiruddin. Sultan
Nasiruddin Mahmud died in AD 1265.
According to Ibn Battuta and Isami, Balban
poisoned his master Nasiruddin and ascended
the throne.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Balban (AD 1266–87)</i></strong></div>

The struggle between the sultan and the
Turkish nobles continued, till one of the Turkish
chiefs, Ulugh Khan, known in history by the
name of Balban, gradually arrogated all power
to himself and finally ascended the throne in AD
1266. When Balban became the Sultan, his
position was not secure. Many Turkish chiefs
were hostile to him; the Mongols were looking
forward for an opportunity for attacking the
Sultanate, the governors of the distant provinces
were also trying to become independent rulers,
the Indian rulers were also ready to revolt at the
smallest opportunity.
<br>
<br>
The law and order situation in the area
around Delhi and in the Doab region had
deteriorated.In the Ganga-Yamuna doab and
Awadh, the roads were infested with the robbers
and dacoits, because of which the
communication with the eastern areas had
become difficult. Some of the Rajput zamindars
had set up forts in the area, and defied the
government. The Mewatis had become so bold
as to plunder people up to the outskirts of Delhi.
To deal with these elements, Balban adopted a
stern policy. In the Mewat many were killed. In
the area around Badayun, Rajput strongholds
were destroyed.
<br>
<br>
Balban ruled in an autocratic manner and
worked hard to elevate the position of the Sultan.
He did not allow any noble to assume great
power. He even formulated the theory of
kingship. The historian Barani, who was himself
a great champion of the Turkish nobles, says that
Balban remarked ‘whenever I see a base born
ignoble man, my eyes burn and I reach in anger
for my sword (to kill him).” We do not know if
Balban actually said these words but his attitude
towards the non-Turks was that of contempt.
Balban was not prepared to share power with
anyone, not even with his own family.
Balban was determined to break the power
of the Chahalgani. To keep himself well
informed, Balban appointed spies in every
department. He also organised a strong
centralized army, both to deal with internal
disturbances, and to repel the Mongols who had
entrenched themselves in the Punjab and posed
a serious threat to the Delhi Sultanate. Balban
re-organised the military department (diwan-iarz) and deployed army in different parts of the
country to put down rebellion. The disturbances
in Mewat, Doab, Awadh and Katihar were
ruthlessly suppressed. Balban also secured
control over Ajmer and Nagaur in eastern
Rajputana but his attempts to capture
Ranthambore and Gwalior failed. In AD 1279,
encouraged by the Mongol threats and the old
age of Sultan the governor of Bengal, Tughril Beg,
revolted, assumed the title of Sultan and had the
khutba read in his name. Balban sent his forces
to Bengal and had Tughril killed. Subsequently
he appointed his own son Bughra Khan as the
governor of Bengal. By all these harsh methods,
Balban controlled the situation. In order to
impress the people with the strength and awe
of his government, Balban maintained a
magnificent court. He refused to laugh and joke
in the court, and even gave up drinking wine so
that no one may see him in a non-serious mood.
He also insisted on the ceremony of sijada
(prostration) and paibos (kissing of the monarch’s
feet) in the court. Balban was undoubtedly one
of the main architects of the Sultanate of Delhi,
particularly of its form of government and
institutions. By asserting the power of the
monarchy, Balban strengthened the Delhi
Sultanate. But even he could not fully defend
northern India against the attacks of the
Mongols. Moreover, by excluding non-Turkish
from positions of power and authority and by
trusting only a very narrow racial group he made
many people dissatisfied. This led to fresh
disturbances and troubles after his death. Balban
adopted a policy of consolidation rather than
expansion. He introduced a new theory of
kingship and redefined the relations between the
Sultan and nobility. Through these measures
Balban strengthened the Delhi Sultanate.
Balban died in AD 1287. After his death the
nobles raised his grandson Kaiquabad to the
throne. He was soon replaced by his son,
Kaimurs, who remained on the throne for a little
over three months. During Balban’s reign, Firoz
had been the warden of the marches in northwest and had fought many successful battles
against the Mongols. He was called to Delhi as
Ariz-i-Mumalik (Minister of War). In AD 1290
Firoz took a bold step by murdering Kaimurs
and seized the throne. A group of Khalji nobles
led by him established the Khalji dynasty. Some
scholars call this event as the ‘dynastic revolution’
of AD 1290. It brought to an end the so called
slave dynasty and Firoz ascended the throne
under the title of Jalaluddin Khalji.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE KHALJIS (AD 1290–1320)</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Jalaluddin Khalji (AD 1290–1296)</i></strong></div>

Jalaluddin Khalji laid the foundation of the
Khalji dynasty. He ascended the throne at the
age of 70 years. Although Jalaluddin retained
the earlier nobility in his administration, but the
rise of Khaljis to power ended the monopoly of
nobility of slaves to high offices. Jalaluddin ruled
only for a short span of six years. He tried to
mitigate some of the harsh aspects of Balban’s
rule. He was the first ruler of the Delhi Sultanate
to clearly put forward the view that the state
should be based on the willing support of the
governed, and that since the large majority of
the people in India were Hindus, the state in
India could not be a truly Islamic state.
Jalaluddin tried to win the goodwill of the
nobility by a policy of tolerance. He avoided
harsh punishments, even to those who revolted
against him. He not only forgave them but at
times even rewarded them to win their support.
However many people including his supporters,
considered him to be a weak sultan.
Jalaluddin’s policy was reversed by Alauddin
Khalji who awarded drastic punishments to all
those who dared to oppose him.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Alauddin Khalji (AD 1296–1316)</i></strong></div>

Alauddin Khalji was Jalaluddin’s ambitious
nephew and son-in-law. He had helped his uncle
in his struggle for power and was appointed as
Amir-i-Tuzuk (Master of Ceremonies). Alauddin
had two victorious expeditions during the reign
of Jalaluddin. After the first expedition of Bhilsa
(Vidisa) in AD 1292, he was given the iqta of
Awadh, in addition to that of Kara. He was also
appointed Arizi-i-Mumalik (Minister of War). In
AD 1294, he led the first Turkish expedition to
southern India and plundered Devagiri. The
successful expedition proved that Alauddin was
an able military commander and efficient
organiser. In July AD 1296, he murdered his
uncle and father-in-law Jalaluddin Khalji and
crowned himself as the Sultan.
<br>
<br>
Alauddin decided to revive Balban’s policies
of ruthless governance. He decided to curb the
powers of the nobles and interference of Ulema
in the matters of the state. He also faced, a few
rebellions in succession during the early years of
his rule. According to Barani, the author of
Tarikh-i-Firuz Shahi, Alauddin felt that there
were four reasons for these rebellions: 1) The
inefficiency of the spy system, 2) the general
practice of the use of wine, 3) Social intercourse
among the nobles and inter marriage between
them and 4) the excess of wealth in the
possession of certain nobles.
<br>
<br>
In order to prevent the reoccurrence of these
rebellions, Alauddin formulated certain
regulations and implemented them. (1) Families
that had been enjoying free land to support
themselves should pay land tax for their
holdings. This curbed the excess of wealth
owned by some people. (2) The Sultan
reorganized the spy system and took measure
to make it more effective. (3) The use of liquor
and intoxicants was prohibited. (4) The nobles
were ordered not to have social gatherings or
inter-marriages without his permission.
Alauddin established a huge permanent,
standing army to satisfy his ambition of conquest
and to protect the country from Mongol invasion.
Market Regulations of Alauddin Khalji
Alauddin’s measures to control the markets
were one of the most important policy initiative.
Since Alauddin wanted to maintain a large
army, he therefore, lowered and fixed the price
of the commodities of daily use. To control the
prices, Alauddin set up three different markets
for different commodities in Delhi. These markets
were the grain market (Mandi), cloth market
(Sarai Adl) and the market for horses, slaves,
cattles, etc. To ensure implementation, Alauddin
appointed a superintendent (Shahna-i-Mandi)
who was assisted by an intelligence officer.
Apart from Shahna-i-Mandi, Alauddin received
daily reports of the market from two other
independent sources, barid (intelligence officer) and
munhiyans (secret spies). Any violation of
Sultan’s orders resulted in harsh punishment,
including expulsion from the capital, imposition
of fine, imprisonment and mutilation.
Control of prices of horses was very
important for the Sultan because without the
supply of good horses at reasonable price to
army, the efficiency of the army could not be
ensured. Low price in the horse market were
ensured by putting a stop to the purchase of
horses by horse dealers and brokers (dalals) in
Delhi market.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Expansion of Delhi Sultanate</i></strong></div>


Under Alauddin Khalji the territorial
expansion of the Delhi Sultanate, beyond North
India, was the most important achievement.
Alauddin first began his territorial conquest
with a campaign against Gujarat. Alauddin was
motivated by his desire to establish a vast empire
and obtain the wealth of Gujarat. The riches of
Gujarat were to pay for his future conquests and
her sea port was to ensure a regular supply of
Arab horses for his army. In AD 1299, an army
under two of Alauddin’s noted generals Ulugh
Khan and Nusarat Khan marched against
Gujarat. Rai Karan the ruler of Gujarat fled, the
temple of Somnath was captured. An enormous
booty was collected. Even the wealthy Muslim
merchants were not spared. Many slaves were
captured. Malik Kafur was one among them
who later became the trusted commander of the
Khalji forces and led the invasions to South India.
Gujarat now passed under the control of Delhi.
After the annexation of Gujarat, Alauddin
turned his attention towards Rajasthan.
Ranthambore was the first target. Ranthambore
was reputed to be the strongest fort of Rajasthan
and had earlier defied Jalaluddin Khalji. The
capture of Ranthambore was necessary to break
the power and morale of the Rajputs. The
immediate cause of attack was that the ruler of
Ranthambore Hamirdeva gave shelter to two
rebellious Mongol soldiers and refused to hand
over them to the Khalji ruler. Hence an offensive
was launched against Ranthambore. To begin
with the Khalji forces suffered losses. Nusrat
Khan even lost his life. Finally Alauddin himself
had to come on the battle filed. In AD 1301, the
fort fell to Alauddin.
<br>
<br>
In AD 1303, Alauddin besieged Chittor,
another powerful state of Rajputana. According
to some scholars, Alauddin attacked Chittor
because he coveted Padmini, the beautiful queen
of Raja Ratan Singh. However many scholars
do not agree with this legend as this is first
mentioned by Jaisi in his Padmavat more than
two hundred years later. According to Amir
Khusrau, the Sultan ordered a general massacre
of the civil population. Chittor was renamed
Khizrabad after the name of Sultan’s son Khizr
Khan. Alauddin however returned back quickly
to Delhi as Mongol army was advancing towards
Delhi. In AD 1305, Khalji army under Ain-ulMulk captured Malwa. Other states such as
Ujjain, Mandu, Dhar and Chanderi were also
captured. After the conquest of Malwa,
Alauddin sent Malik Kafur to the South and
himself attacked Siwana. The ruler of Siwana
Raja Shital Deva defended the fort bravely but
was ultimately defeated. In AD 1311, another
Rajput kingdom Jalor was also captured. Thus
by AD 1311, Alauddin had completed the
conquest of large parts of Rajputana and became
the master of North India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Deccan and South India</i></strong></div>

The imperialist ambitions of Alauddin were
not satisfied with the conquest of the north. He
was determined to conquer south as well. The
wealth of the southern kingdoms attracted him.
The expeditions to the south were sent under
Malik Kafur, a trusted commander of Alauddin
who held the office of the Naib.
<br>
<br>
In AD 1306–07, Alauddin planned fresh
campaign in Deccan. His first target was Rai
Karan (the earlier rule of Gujarat), who had now
occupied Baglana, and defeated him. The second
expedition was against Rai Ramachandra, the
ruler of Deogir who had earlier promised to pay
tribute to Sultan but did not pay. Ramachandra
surrendered after little resistance to Malik Kafur
and was treated honourably. He was kept a
guest at Alauddin’s court and was given a gift
of one lakh tankas and the title of Rai Rayan. He
was also given a district of Gujarat and one of
his daughters was married to Alauddin.
Alauddin showed generosity towards
Ramachandra because he wanted to have
Ramachandra as an ally for campaigns in the
South.
<br>
<br>
After AD 1309 Malik Kafur was despatched
to launch campaign in South India. The first
expedition was against Pratab Rudradeva of
Warangal in the Telengana area. This siege lasted
for many months and came to an end when Rai
agreed to part with his treasures and pay tribute
to Sultan. The second campaign was against
Dwar Samudra and Ma’bar (modern Karnataka
and Tamil Nadu). The ruler of Dwar Samudra,
Vir Ballala III realized that defeating Malik Kafur
would not be an easy task, hence he agreed to
pay tribute to Sultan without any resistance. In
the case of Ma’bar (Pandya Kingdom) a direct
decisive battle could not take place. However,
Kafur plundered as much as he could including
a number of wealthy temples such as that of
Chidambaram. According to Amir Khusrau,
Kafur returned with 512 elephants, 7000 horses,
and 500 mans of precious stone. The Sultan
honoured Malik Kafur by appointing him Naib
Malik of the empire. Alauddin’s forces under
Malik Kafur continued to maintain a control over
the Deccan kingdoms. Following the death of
Alauddin in AD 1316, the Delhi Sultanate was
plunged into confusion.
<br>
<br>
Malik Kafur sat on the throne for a few days,
only to be deposed by Qutbuddin Mubarak
Shah. During this period, rebellions broke out in
Deogir but were harshly suppressed. Qutbuddin
Mubarak Shah was soon murdered and
Khusrau ascended the throne. However he too
did not last long as some dissatisfied officers, led
by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq, defeated and killed
him in a battle. Thus only four years after the
death of Alauddin, the Khalji dynasty came to
end and power passed into the hands of the
Tughlaqs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE TUGHLAQS (AD 1320–1412)</i></strong></div>

The founder of the Tughlaq dynasty was
Ghazi Malik who ascended the throne as
Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq in AD 1320 and this
dynasty ruled till AD 1412. Giyasuddin rose to
an important position in the reign of Alauddin
Khalji. After a brief rule Ghiyassuddin Tughlaq
died in AD 1325 and his son Muhammad
Tughlaq ascended the throne. Under the
Tughlaqs the Delhi Sultanate was further
consolidated. Many outlying territories were
brought under the direct control of the Sultanate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Deccan and South</i></strong></div>

The regions of the Deccan which were
conquered by the Khaljis had stopped paying
tribute and were proclaiming independent
status. Muhammad Tughlaq while a prince
(called Juna Khan) led the early expeditions
against Rai Rudra Dev who was defeated after
a prolonged conflict and Warangal was now
annexed under direct control of the Sultanate.
Ma’bar was also defeated. Now the whole region
of Telangana was divided into administrative
units and made part of the Sultanate. In contrast
to Allauddin Khalji’s policy the Tughlaqs
annexed the Deccan region. Muhammad
Tughlaq even decided to transfer his capital from
Delhi to Deogir and renamed it as Daultabad.
In fact he wanted to control the northern
region from this place. Substantial number of
nobles, religious men and craftsmen shifted to
the new capital. It seems that the idea was to
treat it as the second capital and not abandon
Delhi. Later the whole scheme was given up.
However, the plan improved ties between the
north and south. Apart from territorial
expansion the social, cultural and economic
interactions also grew.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>East India</i></strong></div>

Bhanudeva II, the ruler of Jajnagar in Orissa
had helped Rai Rudra Dev of Warangal in his
battle against Delhi Sultans. Ulug Khan led an
army against him in AD 1324 Bhanudeva II was
defeated and his territory annexed. In Bengal
there was discontent of nobles against their
Sultan. The dissatisfied nobles invited the
Tughlaq prince to invade their ruler. The army
of Bengal was defeated and a noble Nasiruddin
was installed on the throne.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>North West</i></strong></div>

The Mongol invasions from the North-West
region were rocking the Sultanate on regular
intervals. In AD 1326–27 a big Mongol assault
under Tarmashirin Khan took place.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Transfer of Capital</i></strong></div>

One of the controversial measures of
Muhammad bin Tughlaq was that he transferred
his capital from Delhi to Deogir (Daultabad).
According to Dr. Mahdi Hussain, the Sultan
wanted to maintain both Delhi and Daultabad
as his capitals. As per Barani, in AD 1326–27,
Sultan decided to shift his capital from Delhi to
Deogir (Daultabad) in the Deccan because it was
more centrally located. According to Ibn Batuta,
the people of Delhi used to write letters
containing abuses to the Sultan, therefore, in
order to punish them Sultan decided to shift the
capital. Isami say that it was a place at a safer
distance from the North West frontier and thussafe from the Mongols. In view of different
versions it is difficult to assign one definite reason
for this shift.
<br>
<br>
The entire population was not asked to leave
only the upper classes consisting of shaikhs,
nobles, ulema were shifted to Daultabad. No.
attempt was made to shift the rest of the
population. Though Muhammad bin Tughlaq
built a road from Delhi to Deogir and set up rest
houses but the journey was extremely harsh for
the people. Large number of people died because
of rigorous travelling and the heat. Due to
growing discontent and the fact that north could
not be controlled from south, Muhammad
decided to abandon Daultabad.
Muhammad Tughlaq decided to secure the
frontier. The region from Lahore to Kalanur
including Peshawar was conquered and new
administrative control was established. Besides,
the Sultan also planned invasions of Qarachil
region (In present day Himachal) and Qandhar
but did not succeed. In fact these schemes
resulted in heavy loss. Muhammad Tughlaq was
very innovative in adopting new policies. He
started a new department for the development
of Agriculture. It was called Diwan-i Kohi.
Peasants were given financial support to help in
arranging seeds for cultivation. This loan was
also given in case of crop failures. Another
important measure was to introduce token
currency to tide over the shortage of Silver.
However, this scheme failed causing great
financial loss to the sultanate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Token Currency</i></strong></div>

Another controversial project undertaken by
Muhammad bin Tughlaq was the introduction
of “Token Currency”. According to Barani, the
Sultan introduced token currency because the
treasury was empty due to the Sultan’s schemes
of conquest as well as his boundless generosity.
Some historians are of the opinion that there was
a shortage of silver world wide at that time and
India too faced the crisis therefore, the Sultan
was forced to issue copper coins in place of silver.
Muhammad introduced a copper coin (Jittal)
in place of silver coin (tanka) and ordered that it
should be accepted as equivalent to the tanka.
However, the idea of token currency was new
in India and it was difficult for traders and
common people to accept it. The State also did
not take proper precautions to check the
imitation of coins issued by the mints.
Government could not prevent people from
forging the new coins and soon the new coins
flooded the markets. According to Barani the
people began to mint token currency in their
houses. However the common man failed to
distinguish between copper coin issued by the
royal treasury and those which were locally
made. Thus the Sultan was forced to withdraw
the token currency.
<br>
<br>
Muhammad Tughlaq was succeeded by his
cousin Firuz Tughlaq. Under him no new
territories could be added to the Sultanate. He
managed to keep large areas intact with great
efforts. However, the political control of Delhi
gradually weakened during the rule of Firuz’s
successors. The invasion of Timur in AD 1398
left the sultanate desolate. By the end of Tughlaq
rule (AD 1412) the Sultanate was confined to a
small territory in north India. A number of
regions proclaimed independent status. In the
east Bengal and Orissa enjoyed complete
autonomy. In eastern UP and large parts of Bihar
a new independent kingdom of Sharqis emerged.
In the Deccan and South Vijaynagar empire and
Bahmani kingdom became political powers.
Large parts of Punjab were occupied by
independent nobles. Gujarat and Malwa became
fully independent. Rajput states in Rajasthan no
longer treated Delhi Sultans as their overlords.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SAYYID DYNASTY (1414–1450 AD)</i></strong></div>

After defeating the army of Delhi in 1398
Timur appointed Khizr Khan as the ruler of
Multan. Khizr Khan defeated Sultan Daulat
Khan and occupied Delhi and founded Sayyid
dynasty. He did not assume the title of Sultan
but was comfortable with Rayati-Ala. The
author of the Tarikh-i-Mubarak Shahi, Yahya
Sirhindi claims that the founder of the Sayyid
dynasty was a descendant of the prophet.
Khizr Khan was the most competent Sayyid
rule of the dynasty. After Khizr Khan’s death
Mubarak Shah (AD 1412–34) and Muhammad
Shah (AD 1434–45) ascended the throne one
after another. All of these rulers tried to control
rebellious regions like Katehar, Badaun, Etawah,
Patiali, Gwalior, Kampil, Nagaur and Mewat
but they failed due to the conspiracy of the
nobles.
<br>
<br>
In 1445 AD, Alam Shah ascended the throne
and became the Sultan. He proved a totally
incompetent Sultan. Alam Shah’s Wazir Hamid
Khan invited Bhalol Lodi to take charge of the
army and after realizing that it would be difficult
to continue as Sultan, Alam Shah left for
Badaun.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RECONSOLIDATION UNDER LODI
DYNASTY (1451–1526)</i></strong></div>

With the help of a few nobles Bahlol Lodi
(AD 1451–1489) took charge of the army, and
became the Sultan. Thus he laid the foundation
of Lodi dynasty whose rulers were Afghans. The
Lodis were the last ruling family of the Sultanate
period and the first to be headed by the Afghans.
Sultan Bahlol Lodi was a capable general.
He was aware of the fact that to establish his
control over Sultanate he would require help
and support of Afghan nobles. The Afghan
nobles wanted Sultan to treat them as an equal
partner rather than an absolute monarch. To
placate them Bahlol publicly declared that he
considered himself one of the Afghan peers and
not the king. He did not sit on the throne nor
did he insist on his nobles standing in his court.
This policy worked well throughout his long reign
and he did not face any trouble from his powerful
Afghan nobles.
<br>
<br>
Bahlol Lodi successfully suppressed the
revolts in Mewat and Doab. In AD 1476 he
defeated the Sultan of Jaunpur and annexed it
to Delhi Sultanate. He also brought the ruler of
Kalpi and Dholpur under the Suzerainty of
Delhi. However, he failed to reoccupy Bengal,
Gujarat and the Deccan.
After the dealth of Bahlol Lodi, Sikandar
Lodi (AD 1489–1517) ascended the throne.
Sikandar Lodi showed little tolerance towards
the non-mulsims. He re-imposed jaziya on nonmulsims. Sikandar Lodi believed in the superior
position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the nobles. He
compelled nobles and amirs to show formal
respect to the Sultan in darbar and outside and
treated them harshly. He re-annexed Bihar,
Dholpur, Narwar and some parts of the kingdom
of Gwalior and Nagor to the Delhi Sultanate.
After the death of Sikandar Lodi in AD 1517
his nobles helped Ibrahim Lodi to become Sultan.
His reign proved a period of revolts. Firstly his
own brother Jalal Khan rebelled. Sultan Ibrahim
Lodi got him murdered. Bihar declared its
independence. Daulat Khan the governor of
Punjab also rebelled. Sultan’s behaviour caused
much dissatisfaction. The rebellions Daulat Khan
sent an invitation to Babur at Kabul to invade
India. Babur defeated Sultan Ibrahim Lodi in AD
1526 in the battle at Panipat.
Summing up the end of the Sultanate, a
scholar states “The Sultanate of Delhi, which
had its birth on the battlefield of Tarain in AD
1192, breathed its last in AD 1526 a few miles
away on the battlefield of Panipat”.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CHALLENGES FACED BY THE
SULTANATE</i></strong></div>

With the establishment of the Mughal Empire
the rule of Delhi sultanate came to an end.
During more than 300 years of its rule the Delhi
sultanate went through various ups and downs
but survived as a political force. Here we would
like to discuss the major challenges the sultanate
faced.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Attacks by Mongols and others</i></strong></div>
        
Since its inception the major threat to the
sultanate came in the form of Mongol invasions.
Mongols were nomadic groups who inhabited
the steppes north of China and east of Lake
Baikal. They formed a huge nomadic empire
under Chengiz Khan in the 12thcentury. From
13th century onwards they repeatedly attacked
the Delhi Sultanate. The Sultans as a policy
appeased them and also at times confronted.
Balban and Allauddin Khalji confronted them
with full military might. During Khalji’s time
Mongols under Qultlug Khwaja even besieged
Delhi and caused a lot of damage. The last
significant attack of Mongols was by Tarmashirin
during the reign of Muhammad Tughlaq. A lot
of energy and resources of the Sultans were spent
in facing these invasions but they could not
destroy the sultanate.
Another important attack which shook the
foundation of the sultanate was by Timur in
1398. The weakness of the Delhi Sultanate was
made even worse by Timur’s invasion of Delhi
(1398). Timur was a son of the Chief of Chagtai
branch of Turks. When he invaded India he was
the master of almost whole of Central Asia.
Timur’s raid into India was a plundering raid
and his motive was to seize the wealth
accumulated by the Sultans of Delhi over the last
200 years. Sultan Nasiruddin and his Wazir
Mallu Iqbasl faced Timur but were defeated.
Timur entered Delhi and stayed for 15 days. He
ordered general massacre and large number of
Hindu and Muslim including women and
children were murdered. Before leaving India
Timur’s invasion indicated the downfall of Delhi
Sultanate. Delhi Sultanate lost control over
Punjab. Timur appointed Khizr Khan, the ruler
for Multan who controlled Punjab also. After the
fall of Tughlaq dynasty he occupied Delhi and
became the ruler of Delhi Sultanate. He laid the
foundation of Saiyyid Dynasty.
        </li>
        <li>
        
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Inner Conflict of Nobility</i></strong></div>
        
Three hundred years of Delhi Sultanate
witnessed five dynasties ruling over it. The main
reason for change of dynasties and deposing of
rulers was a constant struggle between the
Sultan and the nobility (Umara). Soon after the
death of Aibak they started fighting over the
question of succession. Finally Iltutimish emerged
victorious. Iltutimish created a group of loyal
nobles called Turkan-i-Chihiligani (‘The Forty’).
After the death of Iltutimish various factions of
the group of forty got involved in making their
favourite son/daughter as the sultan. In ten
years five sultans were changed. After that the
Sultan who occupied the throne (Nasiruddin
Mahmud) for 20 years hardly ruled and one of
the powerful noble Balban was defacto sultan.
The same Balban succeeded Nasiruddin after his
death. Almost similar events happened after the
death of each powerful sultan (Balban, Alauddin
Khalji, Firoz Tughlaq and others.) Since there
was no well defined law of succession each noble
tried to either crown himself or support some
favourite heir of the dead sultan. Finally Afghans
replaced the Turks as sultan with the accession
of Bahlol Lodi.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Provincial Kingdoms</i></strong></div>
            
Another consequence of this conflict was
declaration of independence by various
provincial heads in the regions. As a result a
number of independent Afghan and Turkish
kingdoms emerged. Important ones of such
states were Bengal (Lakhnouti), Jaunpur, Malwa,
Gujarat, the Bahmani kingdom in the Deccan
etc. Quite often these states were at war with
the Sultanate. The whole process weakened the
sultanate.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Resistance by Indian Chiefs</i></strong></div>
            
The sultans had to face the resistance from
Indian chiefs at regular intervals. The Rajput
chiefs in Rajputana (Mewar, Ranthambhor,
Chittor etc.), Warangal, Deogiri & Ma’bar in
Deccan and South, the king of Dhar, Malwa in
Central India, Jajnagar in Orissa and a host of
smaller chieftains were constantly at war even
after successive defeats. All these struggles
weakened the sultanate.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


The Delhi sultanate was considerably
weakened after the Khalji and Tughlaq reign.
Finally the invasion of Babur in AD 1526 brought
it to an end. Now a much more centralised and
strong empire under the Mughals established
itself in India and ruled for a further period of
more than two hundred years. We will discuss
it in our next lesson on the Mughal Rule. But
before moving to the Mughals we provide you a
brief account of the provincial kingdoms.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EVOLUTION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE
STRUCTURE UNDER DELHI SULTANATE</i></strong></div>

When Qutubuddin Aibak established himself
as an independent Sultan at Lahore, the
available administrative apparatus was
continued in the initial phase. The prevailing
structure was not altered or disturbed and as
long, as the local rulers recognised the supremacy
of the Sultan in Delhi, they were allowed to
collect taxes and send it to the central treasury
as tribute. The central officials in these areas were
mainly to help the local rulers in their
administrative tasks. With the expansion and
consolidation of the Delhi Sultanate, new
administrative institutions also started emerging.
The administrative structures and institutions
introduced in India were influenced by the
Mongols, Seljukids etc, brought by the new rulers.
The existing administrative institutions in
different parts of the country also contributed
in giving shape to the new system.
The Sultans were aware of the fact that they
had to rule over a subject population that was
largely non-Islamic. Thus the Sultans of Delhi
had to introduce particular measures to suit the
prevailing conditions in the Sultanate. From the
administrative point of view, the local level
administration, it seems, was left mainly in the
hands of village headmen etc. The large extent
of the Sultanate necessitated the evolution of
administrative structure separately for the centre
and provinces. Thus, during the Sultanate
period, administrative institutions emerged at
different levels - central, provincial and local.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Administrative System</i></strong></div>

The government established by the Turks was
a compromise between Islamic political ideas and
institutions on the one hand and the existing
Rajput system of government on the other.
Consequently, many elements of the Rajput
political system, with or without changes,
became part and parcel of the Turkish
administration in India.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MUSLIM POLITICAL IDEAS</i></strong></div>

Theological Basis Muslims believe that
Islamic society and govermet should be organised
on the basis of divine injunctions of the Quran.
The sayings and doings of Prophet Muhammad,
collectively known as hadis, began to be
supplemented with the above. The ulema
(Muslim theologians) gave vrious ruligns on the
basis of the Quran and the hadis to meet different
situations and problems, which are together
known as the Sharia (Islamic Law).
Secular Basis Moreover , Zawabit (rules and
regulations framed by the Sultans) were also used
for a smooth and efficient running of the
administration.
<br>
<br>
Allah-Prophet Relationship According to
the Qurun, the real master and sovereign of the
whole universe is Allah: Allah has sent to all
lands, through the ages: his prophets for the
transmission of his message, Muhammad being
the last one. While it is the duty of the governed
to obey the ruler, it is equally the duty of the
ruler to discharge his functions efficiently.
Caliphate In principle, the entire Muslim
fraternity should have only a single monarch.
But when the caliphate or the empire of the
caliphs became very extensive and disintegrative
forces began to gain the upper hand, the ulema
or Muslim jurists developed the theory of
governors by usurpation and said that whom
the caliph did not oppose he approved.
Similarly they held that only an elected head
could be the ruler. But when the caliphate
became a hereditary monarchy they evolved a
new doctrine of election. Now election by eleven
or five or even by s single person enjoying the
confidence of the people was regarded as election
by the people. This legalised nomination by a
ruling sovereign as election by the people. In the
absence of any widespread uprisings against a
ruler it was held that acquiescence was
tantamount to approval or election by the
people.
<br>
<br>
Caliph-Sultan Relationship Most of the
Sultans kept up the pretence of regarding the
caliph as the legal sovereign while they
themselves were the caliph’s representatives.
Most of them included the name of the caliph in
the khutba (prayer) and the sikka (coin) and
adopted titles indicative of their subordination
to the caliph.
As against this, three rulers emphasised their
own importance. Balban used to say that after
the Prophet the most important office was that
of the sovereign and called himself the ‘Shadow
of God’. Muhammad bin Tughlaq assumed this
style during the early years of his reign and
although Balban had retained the name of the
caliph in the khutba and sikka , Muhammad
made no mention of caliph anywhere. But,
despite all this, neither of them had the audacity
to call himself the caliph. The only person who
had done this was Qutub-ud-din Mubarak
Khalji.
<br>
<br>
But only three Sultans sought, and sacred a
mansur or letter of investiture’ from the caliph.
The first among them was Iltutmish. Next
Muhammad bin Tughlaq tried to pacify the
ulema by securing an investiture from the
Abbasid caliph in Egypt. After him Firoz also
sought and secured it twice.
The real object of honouring the office of the
caliph is interesting. Muslims in general regarded
it as incumbet on the Sultan to show respect to
the caliph, and opposition to the Sultan, who
had been recognised by the caliph as his deputy,
was regarded as contrary to the Hod Law. Hence
the Sultans kept up the pretense of subservience
to the caliph just to exploit the popular Muslim
sentiments in their favour.
Law of Succession According to Islamic
ideals, essential attributes of a sovereign required
that he should be a male adult, suffering from
no physical disability, a freedom Muslim, having
faith in Islam and acquinted with its doctrines,
and he should be elected by the people.
However in practice there were several
violations of the prescribed criteria for being
elected to the throne. Raziya was raised to the
throne despite her womanhood. Minority proved
no bar in the case of Muhammad bin Tughlaq.
Qutub-ud-din Aibak’s authority was recognised
even before his manumission. Kaiqubad
remained the Sultan as a paralytic. Nasir-ud-din
Khusrau had no special reverence for Islam and
yet he was accepted as the Sultan of Delhi. Alaud-din Khalji frankly admitted his ignorance of
the sharia but nobody dubbled him a unfit to
rule on that score. As far as election was
concerned, it had never existed in Islam. At best,
support of a few leading men was regarded as
tantamount to election by the people. This farce
or peculiar type of election by the people. This
farce or peculiar type of election was tried in the
case of Iltutmish, Ghiyasud-din Tughlaq and
Firoz Tughlaq.
<br>
<br>
Theory of Kingship The doctrine of farr or
farrah (supernatural effulgence or radiance) was
first enunciated in the Shah Namah by firdausi,
according to whom the God endows the rulers
with farr, which symbolises the divine favour.
Among the Delhi Sultans, Balban was the first
to exhibit his aware-ness of the doctrine when
he remarked that ‘the king’s heart is the mirror
of the divine attributer’. Later Amir Khusrau
observed that Kaiqubad was endowed with the
farr.
Limits to Sultan’s Authority in the framing
of new rules and regulations the authority of the
Sultan was circumscribed and every ruler could
not govern the kingdom in complete disregard
of the advice of the ulema or theologians as Alaud-din Khalji and Muhammad Tughlaq had
been able to do. The power of the nobility also
blunted their authority to some extent. When
there was a weak ruler on the throne, the nobles,
and the ulema particularly, dominated him. But
during the reign of Balban, Ala-ud-din Khalji or
Muhammad Tughlaq, these checks proved
ineffective. The Sultans were not powerful
enough to rule the land in complete disregard of
the sentiments of the Hindus. And, the
numericial inferiority of the Muslims gave them
little or no opportunity to interfere with local
government.
<br>
<br>
During the Sultanate period the
administrative apparatus was headed by the
Sultan who was helped by various nobles. There
were various other offices along with the office
of the Sultan. Theoretically, there was a council
of Ministers Majlis-i-Khalwat to assist the Sultan.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Sultan</i></strong></div>    
        
The Sultan was the central figure in the
administrative set up. He was the head of the
civil administration and Supreme Commander
of the army. He made all the appointments and
promotions. He also had the right to remove
anybody from the service. He had absolute
power in his hand. He was also the head of the
Judiciary. He used to confer titles and honours
upon people. Theoretically the Sultan had an
exalted position but in actual practice different
Sultans enjoyed varying power. The position of
the Sultan was always under pressure from the
powerful group of nobility and Ulema. Sultans
of Delhi, particularly the powerful Sultans,
adopted various strategies to keep these groups
under control. Balban kept the nobles firmly
under his control. Thus the personality of the
Sultan played a significant role in the
administrative structure of the Sultanate. Under
the capable and strong Sultans, the
administration and the administrative structure
functioned well but under the inefficient and
weak ruler the same was under pressure.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nobility</i></strong></div>
        
The nobles were the most important
functionaries of the state and enjoyed high social
status. In the initial stage they were those
commanders who came with the victorious
army. Over a period of time their descendants
formed the main strength and some Indian
groups also emerged. The position and power
of the nobility varied from time to time as has
been mentioned above. Nobles, particularly those
who were based at Delhi, emerged as a very
powerful group and at times even played a role
in the selection of the sultan.
The nobility was not a homogeneous class.
There were different groups within the nobility
and often there were inter group clashes and
rivalries. The clash between Turkish and Tajik
nobles started during the time of Iltutmish and
became intense after his death. The group of
chahalgan (group of 40 nobles), which was
created by Iltutmish, also emerged very
powerful.
<br>
<br>
Balban was the first Sultan to bring the
nobility firmly under his control (interestingly,
he had been a part of chalalgan earlier).
Qutubuddin Aibak and Iltutmish had considered
the nobles at par with themselves. Balban
maintained distance from the nobility and
enforced strict code of conduct for himself and
for the nobility. No loose talk or laughter was
allowed in the court. He also emphasized on high
blood and made it a criteria for occupying high
positions and offices.
With the expansion of the Delhi Sultanate
there were also attempts on the part of different
sections of the society to join the nobility. Initially
it was the preserve of the Turks only. During
the rule of the Khalji and Tughlags the doors of
the nobility were opened to people of diverse
backgrounds. The low caste people, both Hindus
and Muslims, joined the nobility and could rise
to high positions especially under Muhammad
Bin Tughlaq. During the Lodi period the Afghan
concept of equality became important when the
Sultan was considered “first among equals”.
Thus the nobles enjoyed equal status with the
Sultan. Some of the Lodi Sultans like Sikandar
Lodi and Ibrahim Lodi found this uncomfortable
and tried to bring the nobles under their control.
The nobles resisted this which resulted in the
trouble for both the Sultans.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ulema</i></strong></div>
            
The religious intellectual group of Muslims
was collectively referred as Ulema. People of this
group managed religious matters and interpreted
religious regulations for Sultan. They were also
incharge of judicial matters and worked as Qazis
at various levels. It was quite influential group
and commanded respect of Sultan and nobility.
They also had influence among Muslim masses.
This group used to pressurize the sultan to run
the Sultanate as per the religious laws of Islam.
The Sultan and nobles generally tried to run the
administrative affairs as per the need of state
rather than religious laws. Sultan like Alauddin
Khalji could ignore the opinions of Ulema on a
number of issues but some followed their line.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Administration</i></strong></div>

As already mentioned the administrative
system was headed by the Sultan. There were a
number of departments which were assigned
different responsibilities. These departments
were managed by influential nobles. We will
provide a brief account of a few departments.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Wizarat</i></strong></div>
            
After Sultan, the most important office was
the Diwan-i-Wizarat, headed by the wazir. It was
a key position in the royal court and his role was
of a general supervisor over all departments,
though he was one of the four important
departmental heads. He was the chief advisor
to the Sultan. The main functions of the wazir
were to look after the financial organization of
the State, give advice to the Sultan, and on
occasions to lead military expeditions at Sultan’s
behest. He also supervised the payment to the
army. The wizarat or the office of wazir also kept
a check on land revenue collections, maintained
a record of all the income and expenditure
incurred by the state and thus controlled or
recorded the salaries of all royal servants,
handled the charitable donations such as Waqfs,
Inams etc. Further, the Mints, the intelligence
departments, the royal buildings and other
bodies affiliated to the royal court were
supervised by the wizarat. The wazir had direct
access to the Sultan and it was on his wisdom,
sincerity and loyalty that the position of the
Sultan depended greatly.
There were several other departments which
worked under the wizarat. They were entrusted
with specific functions. These included Mustaufii-Mumalik (Auditor General), Mushrif-i-Mumalik
(Accountant General), Majmuadar (Keeper of
loans and balances from treasury). Later some
other offices were brought under the supervision
of the Wizarat like Diwan-i -Waqoof (to supervise
expenditure), Diwan-i-Mustakharaj (to look into
the arrears of revenue payments), Diwan-i-Amir
Kohi (to bring uncultivated land into cultivation
through state support).</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Diwan-i-Arz</i></strong></div>    
        
This department was set up to look after the
military organization of the empire. It was
headed by Ariz-i-Mumalik. He was responsible
for the administration of military affairs. He
maintained royal contingent, recruited the
soldiers, ensured the discipline and fitness of the
army, inspected the troops maintained by the
Iqta-holders, examined the horses and branded
them with the royal insignia. During times of
war, the ariz arranged military provisions,
transportation and administered the army at
war, provided constant supplies and was the
custodian of the war booty. Alauddin Khalji
introduced the system of Dagh (branding) and
huliya (description) and cash payment to the
soldiers in order to strengthen his control over
the army. The contingent stationed at Delhi was
called hasham-i-qalb and Provincial contingents
were called hasham-i-atraf.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Diwan-i-Insha</i></strong></div>    
        
This department looked after the state
correspondence. It was headed by Dabir-i-Khas.
He drafted and despatched royal orders and
received reports from various officers. The Dabir
was the formal channel of communication
between the centre and other regions of the
empire. He was also a sort of private secretary
of the Sultan and was responsible for writing
the farmans.
The Barid-i-Mumalik was the head of the state
news gathering and dealt with intelligence. He
had to keep information of all that was
happening in the Sultanate. At local level there
were barids who used to send regular news
concerning the matters of the state to the central
office. Apart from barids, another set of reporters
also existed who were known as Munihiyan.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Diwan-i-Rasalat</i></strong></div>    
        
This department dealt with the
administration of Justice. It was headed by Sadrus-Sadr who was also the qazi-i-mumalik. He was
the highest religious officer and took care of
ecclesiastical affairs. He also appointed the qazis
(judges) and approved various charitable grants
like waqf, wazifa, Idrar, etc.
The Sultan was the highest court of appeal
in both civil and criminal matters. Next to him
was Qazi-i-mumalik. The Muhtasibs (Public
Censors) assisted the judicial department. Their
main task was to see that there was no public
infringement of the tenets of Islam. He was also
to supervise and enforce the public morals and
conduct.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Other Departments</i></strong></div> 
            
Apart from these, there were a number of
smaller departments at the centre which helped
in the everyday administration of the empire.
Wakil-i-dar looked after the royal household and
managed the personal services of the Sultan.
Amir-i-Hajib looked after the royal ceremonies.
He used to act as an intermediary between the
Sultan and subordinate officials and between
Sultan and the public. Sar-i-Jandar looked after
the royal body guards. Amir-i-Akhur looked after
the establishment of horses and Shahnah-i-fil
looked after the establishment of elephants.
Amir-i-Majlis looked after the arrangement of
meetings and special ceremonies. The Royal
workshops (Karkhanas) played an important
role in the administrative system of the Sultanate.
The needs of the royal household were met
through Karkhanas. The Karkhanas were of two
types - (i) Manufactories (ii) Store House. Under
Feroz Tughlaq, there were as many as 36
Karkhanas. Each Karkhana was supervised by
a noble who had the rank of a Malik or a Khan.
The Mutasarrif was responsible for the accounts
and acted as immediate supervisors in various
departments.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Provincial Administration</i></strong></div>

The administration in the areas that were
outside the core political area was carried out in
a number of ways. It depended on the degree of
political control which was exercised over the
areas. The territorial expansion and
consolidation of the sultanate was a process
which continued throughout the 13th and 14th
centuries. Some of the newly conquered areas
were brought directly under the control of the
Sultanate and some other areas remained semi
autonomous. Thus different Control mechanisms
were adopted by the Sultan for these areas. In
the areas that were loosely affiliated to the
Sultanate, a few officials were appointed by the
Centre as a symbol of imperial presence but
everyday administration remained in local
hands. The interest of the centre in these areas
was mostly economic, i.e. the collection of the
revenue.
<br>
<br>
The provinces were placed under the charge
of the Governors who were responsible for the
overall administration of the area. This involved
ensuring the collection of revenue, maintaining
law and order and keeping rebellious elements
under control. He was a deputy of the Sultan in
his area. Since the officials were frequently
transferred and not familiar with the areas, they
were generally dependent on local officials to
perform their duties. The collection of the
revenue was not possible without the help of the
local officials. Thus the governor and the local
power blocs worked in close association with
each other. At times the combination created
problems for the Sultan as the governors used to
become powerful with the help provided by the
local rulers and rise in rebellion against the
Sultan. During the 14th century the provinces
were partitioned into Shiqs for administrative
convenience. The shiqs were administered by the
Shiqdar. Subsequently the Shiqs got transformed
into Sarkar during the Afghan period. Faujdar
was another officer along with Shiqdar at the
provincial level. Their duties are not clearly
articulated, and often the role of the two seem
to overlap. The Shiqdar assisted the governor in
the maintenance of law and order and provided
military assistance. He also supervised the
functioning of the smaller administrative units.
The duties of the Faujdar were similar to the
Shiqdar. The Kotwals were placed under the
Faujdar.
<br>
<br>
The other important officers at the provincial
level were Barids (intelligence officer and
reporter) and Sahib-i-Diwan (who maintained the
financial accounts of the provincial income and
expenditure).


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Iqta System</i></strong></div>

The institution of the Iqta had been in force
in early Islamic world as a form of reward for
services to the state. In the caliphate
administration it was used to pay civil and
military officers. After the establishment of the
Sultanate iqta system was introduced by the
Sultans. To begin with the army commanders
and nobles were given territories to administer
and collect the revenue. The territories thus
assigned were called iqta and their holders as
iqtadar or muqti.
<br>
<br>
In essence this was a system of payment to
the officers and maintenance of army by them.
Gradually rules and regulations were laid down
to organize the whole system. Through the years
it became the main instrument of administrating
the Sultanate. Further the sultans could get a
large share of the surplus production from
different parts of the vast territories through this
system.
From the 14th century we hear of Walis or
muqtis who are commanders of military and
administrative tracts called Iqta. Their exact
powers varied according to circumstances. In due
course the muqti was given complete charge of
the administration of the iqta which included
the task of maintaining an army. The muqti was
to help the sultan with his army in case of need.
He was expected to maintain the army and meet
his own expenses with the revenue collected.
From the time of Balban the muqti was expected
to send the balance (fawazil) of the income to the
centre after meeting his and the army’s expenses.
This means that the central revenue department
had made an assessment of the expected income
of the Iqta, the cost of the maintenance of the
army and the muqti’s own expenses. This process
became even more strict during the time of
Alauddhin Khalji. As the central control grew,
the control over muqti’s administration also
increased. The Khwaja (probably same as Sahibi-Diwan) was appointed to keep a record of the
income of the Iqtas. It was on the basis of this
record that the Sultan used to make his revenue
demands. A barid or intelligence officer was also
appointed to keep the Sultan informed. During
the reign of Muhmmad-bin-Thughlaq a number
of governors were appointed on revenue sharing
terms where they were to give a fixed sum to
the state. During the time of Feroze Shah
Tughlaq the control of state over iqtas was
diluted when iqtas became hereditary.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Local Administration</i></strong></div>

The village was the smallest unit of administration. The functioning and administration of
the village remained more or less the same as it
had existed in pre Turkish times. The main village functionaries were khut, Muqaddam and
Patwari. They worked in close coordination with
the muqti in the collection of revenue and in
maintaining law and order etc. A number of villages formed the Pargana. The important Pargana officials were Chaudhary, Amil (revenue
collector) and Karkun (accountant). Village and
pargana were independent units of administration, and yet there were inter related areas. In
certain cases the province had a local ruler (Rai,
Rana, Rawat, Raja) who helped the governor in
his duties. In such cases the local rulers were
recognised as subordinates of the Sultan.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MARKET REFORMS OF
ALAUDDIN KHALJI</i></strong></div>

The market reforms of Alauddin Khalji were
oriented towards administrative and military
necessities. Medieval rulers believed that
necessities of life, especially food grains, should
be available to the city folk at reasonable prices.
But few rulers had been able to control the prices
for any length of time. Alauddin Khalji was more
or less the first ruler who looked at the problem
of price control, in a systematic manner and was
able to maintain stable prices for a considerable
period. It has been pointed out that Alauddin
Khalji instituted the market control because after
the mongol seige of Delhi, he wanted to recruit
a large army. All his treasures would have soon
exhausted if he was to spend huge resources on
army. With low prices the sultan could recruit a
large army with low expenses. Whatever may
be the reason for the market reforms, elaborate
administrative arrangements were made to
ensure that the market control was followed
strictly.
<br>
<br>
Alauddin fixed the prices of all commodities
from grain to cloth, slaves, cattles etc. He also
set up three markets at Delhi, the first for food
grains, the second for cloth of all kinds and for
expensive items such as sugar, ghee, oil, dry fruits
etc. and the third for the horses, slaves and cattle.
For controlling the food prices, Alauddin tried
to control not only the supply of food grains from
the villages, and its transportation to the city by
the grain merchants, but also its proper
distribution to the citizens. A number of
measures were taken to see that prices laid down
by the Sultan were strictly observed. An officer
(Shehna) was in charge of the market to see that
no one violates the royal orders. Barids
(intelligence officers ) and munhiyan (secret spies)
were also appointed. Alauddin also tried to
ensure that there were sufficient stocks of foodgrains with the government so that the traders
did not hike up prices by creating an artificial
scarcity, or indulge in profiteering. Granaries
were set up in Delhi and Chhain (Rajasthan).
The Banjaras or Karwaniyan who transported the
food grains from the country side to the city were
asked to form themselves in a body. They were
to settle on the banks of Yamuna with their
families. An official (Shehna) was appointed to
oversee them. To ensure the regular supply of
food grains to the Banjaras, a number of
regulations were made. All the food grains were
to be brought to the market (mandis) and sold
only at official prices.
The second market for cloth, dry fruits, ghee
etc. was called Sarai-i- adl. All the clothes brought
from different parts of the country and also from
outside were to be stored and sold only in this
market at government rates. To ensure an
adequate supply of all the commodities, all the
merchants were registered and a deed taken
from them that they would bring the specified
quantities of commodities to the Sarai-i-adl every
year. The Merchants who, brought commodities
from long distances including foreign countries
were given advance money on the condition that
they would not sell to any intermediaries. In
cases of costly commodities an officer was to
issue permits to amirs, maliks etc. for the
purchase of these expensive commodities in
accordance with their income. This was done to
prevent any black marketing of these expensive
products.
<br>
<br>
The third market dealt with horses, cattle
and slaves. The supply of horses of good quality
at fair prices was important for the army.
Alauddin did away with the middleman or dallal
who had become very powerful. It was decided
that the government fixed the quality and prices
of the horses. Similarly, the prices of slave boys
and girls and of cattle were also fixed. But these
reforms didn’t last long and after the death of
Alauddin these reforms got lost.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RURAL CLASSES</i></strong></div>


<b>Peasantry:</b> The peasantry, known as the
balahars, paid one thrd of their produce as land
revenue, sometimes even one half of the produce.
Besides land revenue, they paid certain other
taxes which prove that taxation during this
period was as much, if not higher than, as in the
previous period. In other words, the peasants
were always living at the subsistence level which
was easily denied by the frequent wars, thus
resulting in large scale, and not so infrequent,
famines.
<br>
<b>Maqaddams and Small Landlord:</b> They had
a better standard of life, for they readily misused
their power in order to exploit the ordinary
peasants.
<br>
<b>Autonomous Chieftains:</b> They constituted
the most prosperous rural section Though they
were now a defeated ruling class, they were still
powerful in their respective areas and continued
to live a luxurious life as in the pre-Muslim
period.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Improvement of Agriculture</i></strong></div>

The Sultans undertook efforts to enhance
agricultural production by providing irrigational
facilities and by advancing takkavi loans for
different agricultural purpose. They also
encouraged peaseants to cultivate cash crops
instead of food crops, and superior crops (wheat)
in place of inferior ones (barley). There was an
overall improvement in the quality of Indian
fruits and the system of gardening. Waste lands
were granted to different people thereby
extending the cultivated area.
<br>
<br>
The Indian agriculture has always depended
on various sources of water both natural and
artificial, for its irrigational requirements, viz -
rain, wells, river, tanks, canals, lakes, etc. Dams,
lakes and water reservoirs were some of the
important means of irrigation. In south India,
the state, local chiefs and temple managements
constructed a number of dams over rivers for
this purpose. The Madag lake, for instance, was
built by the Vijaynagar rulers on the Tungbhadra
river to meet the irrigational need of the adjoining
territories. Lakes and water reservoirs such as
the Dhebar, Udaisagar, Rajasamand and
Jaisamand (all in Mewar); Balsan (Marwar) and
Mansagar (Amber) etc. served as important
sources of irrigation in medieval Rajasthan.
Wells, as a common source of irrigation, were
uniformly spread in different parts of the
country. A number of artificial devices were used
to lift water from wells. Pulleys were employed
over wells for this purpose. Another device
worked on the lever principle. In this method,
fork of an upright beam was kept in a swinging
position with its one end tied with a long rope
and the other carried a weight heavier than the
filled bucket. The Persian wheel which began to
be used in India from the Sultanate period,
however, was the most advanced water lifting
device of this period. In this method, a garland
of pots was attached to the rim of a wheel, a
gear mechanism was also attached to it, and with
the help of animal power this wheel was made
to rotate.
<br>
<br>
The Delhi Sultans, in particular, promoted
canal irrigation. Ghiyassuddin Tughlaq (A.D
1320–1325) built a number of canals for this
purpose. However, Firuz Shah Tughlaq laid the
largest network of canals. Four such canals are
frequently mentioned in contemporary sources.
These were - (i) from Sutlej to Ghaggar, (ii)
Opening from the Nandavi and Simur hills to
Arasani, (iii) from Ghaggar, reaching upto the
village to Hiransi Khera, and (iv) excavated from
Yamuna and extended upto Firuzabad.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GROWTH OF COMMERCE AND
URBANIZATION</i></strong></div>

During the Sultanate period, the process of
urbanization gained momentum. A number of
cities and towns had grown during this period.
Lahore, Multan, Broach, Anhilwara, Laknauti,
Daulatabad, Delhi and Jaunpur were important
among them. Delhi remained the largest city in
the East. The growth of trade and commerce was
described by contemporary writers. India
exported a large number of commodities to the
countries on the Persian Gulf and West Asia and
also to South East Asian countries. Overseas
trade was under the control of Multanis and
Afghan Muslims. Inland trade was dominated
by the Gujarat Marwari merchants and Muslim
Bohra merchants. Construction of roads and
their maintenance facilitated for smooth
transport and communication. Particularly the
royal roads were kept in good shape. Sarais or
rest houses on the highways were maintained
for the convenience of the travelers.
Barani, a contemporary historian, gives an
excellent account of their riches. Political
unification of major parts of India removed the
political as well as economic barriers.
Introduction of the institution of dalals or brokers
(dalal, meaning one who acts as an intermediary,
is Arbic in origin), facilitated commercial
transactions on a large scale. Construction of
new roads and maintenance of old ones
facilitated easy and smooth transport and
communication. Sarais or rest houses were
maintained on the roads for the convenience of
traders and merchants.
<br>
<br>
Cotton textile and silk industry flourished in
this period. Sericulture was introduced on a large
scale which made India less dependent on other
countries for the import of raw silk. Paper
industry had grown and there was an extensive
use of paper from 14th and 15th centuries. Other
crafts like leather-making, metal-crafts and
carpet-weaving flourished due to the increasing
demand. The royal karkhanas supplied the goods
needed to the Sultan and his household. They
manufactured costly articles made of gold, silver
and gold ware. The system of coinage had also
developed during the Delhi Sultanate.
Causes for Changes in Urban Economy
The foremost cause was the immigration of
artisans and merchants from the Islamic East to
India, bringing with them their crafts, techniques
and practices. Secondly, there was an abundant
supply of docile trainable labour obtained
through large scale enslavement. Finally, the
Delhi Sultans established a revenue system
though which a large share of agricultural
surplus was appropriate for consumption in
towns.
<br>
<br>
Contemporary historians like Isami give us
a good account of the immigration of artisans
and merchants to India. The large number of
captive obtained for enslavement in the military
campaigns were trained as artisans by their
captors, and they later became free artisans by
obtaining or buying their freedom. Thus the
immigration and enslavement were responsible
for the growth of urban centres and crafts, and
their sustenance was provided by the increase
in the revenues with the establishment of the new
land revenue system. The ruling class, who
appropriated a large part of the country’s
surplus, spent most of it in towns.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Coins of Delhi Sultanate</i></strong></div>

The gold coins which Muhammad of Ghur
struck in imitation of the issues of the Hindu
kings of Kanauj, with the goddess Lakshmi on
the obverse, are without a parallel in Islamic
History. For the first forty years the currency
consisted almost entrirely of copper and billon:
hardly have any gold coins been struck and silver
coins of the earlier Sultans are scarce.
Iltutmish, however, issued several types of
the silver tanka, the earliest of which has a
portrait of the king of horseback on the obverse.
The latest type bears witness to the diploma in
investiture he had received from the Khalifa of
Baghdad, AI Mustansir.
<br>
<br>
Gold, though minted by Masud, Nasir-uddin Mahmud, Balban and Jalal-ud-din Khalji,
was not common until Ala-ud-din Khalji had
enriched his treasury by conquests in south India.
These gold coins are replicas of the silver in
weight and design. Ala-ud-din, whose silver
issues are very plentiful, changed the design by
dropping the name of the caliph from the obverse
and substituting the self laudatory titles. The
second Alexander, the right hand of the
Khalifate. His successor, Mubarak, whose issues
are in som respects the finest tof the whole series,
employed the old Indian square shape for som
of his gold, silver and billon. On his coins appear
the even more arrogant titles, The supreme head
of Islam, the Khalifa of the Lord of heaven and
earth. Ghiyas-ud-din Tughluq was the first
Indian sovereign to use the title Ghazi
(Champion of the faith).
<br>
<br>
Most of the coins struck in billon by these
early Sultans, including Muhammad of Ghur,
are practically uniform in size and weigh (about
56 grains). Numerous varieties were struck. The
Indian type known as the delhiwala, with the
humped bull and the sovereign’s name in Nagari
on the reverse, and the Delhi Chauhan type of
horseman on the obverse, lasted till the reign of
Masud. Another type with the Horseman
obverse and the Sultan’s name and titles in
Arabic on the reversem survived till Nasir-uddin Mahmud’s reign. The billon coins of Ala-uddin Khalji are the first to bear dates. The earliest
copper of this period is small and insignificant.
Some coins, as well as a few billon pieces, bear
the inscription adl, which may mean simply
currency. All copper is dateless.
Muhammad bin Tughluq, has been called the
Prince of moneyers. Not only do his coins surpass
those of his predecessors in execution, especially
in calligraphy but his large output of gold, the
number of his issues of all denominations the
interest of the inscriptions, reflecting his
character and activities, his experiments with the
coinage, entitle him to a place among the greatest
moneyers of history. For his earliest gold and
silver pieces he retained the old 172.8 grain
standard of his predecessors. His first experiment
was to add to tesem in the first years of his reign,
gold dinars of 201.6 grains and silver aslis of 144
grains weight. Muhammad bin Tughluq’s gold
and silver issues, like those of his predecessors,
are identical in type. One of the earliest and most
curious of these was struck both at Delhi and
Daulatabad, in memory of his father. It bears
the superscription of Ghiyas-ud-din
accompanied by the additional title, al-Shahid
(the Martyr). The early gold and silver, of which
about half a dozen different types exist, were
minted at eight different places, including Delhi.
And at least twenty five varieties of his bullion
coinage are known. From inscriptions on the
token currency we learn the nams of their
various denominations. There appear to have
been two scales of division, one for use at Delhi
and other for Daulatabad and the south. In the
former the silver tanka was divided into forty
eight, and in the latter into fifty jitals.
The gold of Firoz Shah is fairly common, and
six types are known. Following his predecessors
example he inscribed the name of the caliph on
the obverse and his own name on the reverse.
Firoz associated the name of his son, Fath Khan,
with his own on the coinage. Gold coins of
subsequent kings are exceedingly scarce; the
shortage of silver is even more apparent. Only
three silver pices of Firoz have ever come to light,
but the copper coins are abundant.
The coinage of the later rulers, though
abounding in varieties is almost confined to
copper and billon pieces. During the whole
period, with but two exceptions, one mint name
appears, Delhi. The long reign of Firoz seems to
have established his coinage as a popular
meadium of exchange and this probably
accounts for the prolonged series of his
posthumous billon coins, extending over a period
of forty years. Some of these and of the
posthumous issues of his son, Muhammad and
of his grandson, Mahmud, were struck by
Daulat Khan Lodhi and Khizr Khan. The
coinage of the Lodhi family, despite the
difference in standard, bears a close resemblance
to that of the Sharqi King of Jaunpur.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EVOLUTION OF
INDO-PERSIAN CULTURE</i></strong></div>

The establishment of the Delhi sultanate
market a new phase in the cultural development
of the country. When the Turks came to India
they not only had a well defined faith in Islam
to which they were deeply attached, they also
had definite ideas of government arts
architecture, etc. The interaction of the Turks
with the Indians who had strong religious beliefs,
well defined ideas of arts, architecture and
literature resulted in the long one with many ups
and down.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ART AND ARCHITECTURE
UNDER SULTANATE</i></strong></div>


<b>Architecture:</b> The assimilation of different
styles and elements to create a new one is well
represented by the architecture of the Sultanate
period. Many of the characteristics of Indian
architecture are obvious in the buildings of the
Muslim rulers. This was because though the
buildings were designed by Muslim architects to
suit the requirements of their religious ideas,
Hindu craftsmen actually built them. The new
features brought by the Turkish conquerors were:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the dome;</li>
        <li>lofty towers:</li>
        <li>the true arch unsupported by beam:</li>
        <li>the vault. This showed advanced
mathematical knowledge and
engineering skill. They also brought with
them an expert knowledge of the use of
concrete and mortar, which had
hitherto been little used in India. The
Sultans of Delhi were liberal patrons of
architecture and they erected numerous
splendid edifices The use of arch and
the dome had a number of advantages.
The dome provided a pleasing skyline.
The arch and the dome dispensed with
the need for a larger number of pillars
to support the roof and enabled the
construction of large halls with a clear
view. Such place of assembly were useful
in mosques as well as in palaces. The
arch and the dome needed a strong
cement otherwise the stones could not
be hel in place. The Turks used fine
quality mortar in their buildings.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The architectural device generally used by
the Indians consisted of putting one stone over
another, narrowing the gap till it could be
covered by a caping stone or by putting a beam
over a slab of stones which is known as the slab
and beam method.The Turks eschewed
representation of human and animal figures in
the buildings. Instead, they used geometrical and
floral designs, combining them with panels of
inscriptions containing verses from the Quran.
Thus the Arbic script itself became a work of art.
The combination of these decorative devices was
called arabesque. They also freely borrowed
Hindu motifs such as the bell motif, lotus etc.
The skill of the Indian stone cutters was fully
used. They also added colour to their buildings
by using red sand stone, yellow sand stone and
marble.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Development and Growth</i></strong></div>

Ilbari were the first to converted temples
and other existing buildings into mosques.
Examples of his are the Quwwat-ul-islam
mosque near the Qutub Minar in Delhi (which
had originally been a Jaina temple then
converted into a Vishnu temple by som Hindus,
and finally into the mosque by the Turks) and
the building at Ajmer called Arhai Din Ka
Jhonpra (which had been a monastery) an
exquisitely carved mehrab of white marble and
a decorative arch screen. The first example of
true or voussoired arch is said lo be the tomb of
Ghiyas-ud-din Balban in Mehrauli. The most
magnificent building constructed by the Turks
(founded by Aibak and completed by Iltutmish)
in the 13th century was the Qutub Minar at
Delhi. The tower standing at 71.4 metres was
dedicated to the sufi sant, Qutub-ud-din
Bakhtiyar Kaki. Although traditions of building
tower are to be found both in India and West
Asia, the Qutub Minar is unique in many ways.
It derives its effect mainly from the skillful
manner in which the balconies have been
projected yet linked with the main tower the use
of red and white sand stone and marble in panels
and in the top stages, and the ribbed effect.
In the Khalji period the usage of voussoired
arch and dome was established once and for all.
The monuments show a rich decorative
character. Ala-ud-din built his capital at Siri, a
few kilometres away from the site around the
Qutub, but hardly anything of this city survives
now. Ala-ud-din planned a tower twice the
hight of the Qutub, but did not live to complete
it. But he added an entrance door to the Qutub,
called the Alai Darwaza. It has arches of very
pleasing proportions. It also contains a dome
which, for the first time was built on correct
scientific lines.
<br>
<br>
The Tughlaq buildings show stark simplicity
and sobriety. It is marked by the sloping walls
or the batter which gives the effect of strength
and solidarity to the building. However we do
not find any batter in the buildings of Firoz:
Secondly, they attempted to combine the
principles of the arch and the dome with the slab
and beam in their buildings. This is found in a
marked manner in the building of Firoz. In the
Hauz Khas alternate stories have arches and the
lintel and beam. The same is to be found in some
buildings of Firoz’s Kotla fort. Finally the
Tughluqs generally used the cheaper and more
easily available greystone. Since it was onot easy
to carve this type of stone their buildings have
minimum decoration. Ghiyas-ud-din and
Muhammad Tughluq built the huge palace cum
fortress complex called Tughluqabad. By
Blocking the passage of the Yamuna a huge
artificial lake was created around it. The tomb
of Ghiyasuddin built by Muhammad Tughluq,
marks a new trend in architecture. To have a
good skyline, the building was put up on a high
platform. Firoz Shah Tughluq built the famous
Hauz Khas (a pleasure resort) and the Kotla
(fort) at Delhi.
<br>
<br>
The Lodhis further developed the tradition
of combining many of the new devices brought
by the Turks with indigenous forms. Both the
arch and the beam are used in their buildings.
Balconies, kiosks and caves of the RajsthaniGujrati style are used. Another device used by
the Lodhis was placing their buildings, especially
tombs, on a high platform, thus giving the
building a feeling of size as well as a better
skyline. Some of the tombs are placed in the midst
of gardens. The Lodhi garden in Delhi is a fine
example of this. Some of the tombs are of an
octagonal shape. Many of these features were
adopted by the Mughals later on and their
culmination is to be found in the Taj Mahal built
by Shah Jahan.
<br>
<br>
<b>Music:</b> The Turks inherited the rich Arab
tradition of music which had been further
developed in Iran and Central Asia. They
brought with them a number of new musical
instruments, such as the rabab and sarangi and
new musical modes and regulations.
Amir Khusrau introduced many new ragas
such as ghora and sanam. He evolved a new style
of light music known as qwalis by blending the
Hindu and Iranian systems. The invention of sitar
was also attributed to him. The Indian classical
work Ragadarpan was translated into Persian
during the reign of Firoz Tughlaq. Pir Bhodan, a
Sufi saint was one of the great musicians of this
period. Raja Man Singh of Gwalior was a great
lover of music. He encouraged the composition
of a great musical work called Man Kautuhal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Persian Literature</i></strong></div>

The Delhi Sultans patronized learning and
literature. Many of them had great love for
Arabic and Persian literature. Learned men came
from Persia and Persian language got
encouragement from the rulers. Besides theology
and poetry, the writing of history was also
encouraged. Some of the Sultans had their own
court historians.
<br>
<br>
The most famous historians of this period
were Hasan Nizami, Minhaj-us-Siraj, Ziauddin
Barani, and Shams-Siraj Afif. Barani’s TarikhiFiroz Shahi contains the history of Tughlaq
dynasty. Minhaj-us-Siraj wrote Tabaqat-i- Nasari,
a general history of Muslim dynasties up to 1260.
Amir Khusrau (1252-1325) was the famous
Persian writer of this period. He wrote a number
of poems. He experimented with several poetical
forms and created a new style of Persian poetry
called Sabaqi- Hind or the Indian style. He also
wrote some Hindi verses. Amir Khusrau’s
Khazain-ul-Futuh speaks about Alauddin’s
conquests. His famous work Tughlaq Nama deals
with the rise of Ghyiasuddin Tughlaq.He was
also an accomplished musician and took part in
religious musical gatherings (samas) organised
by the famous Sufi saint, Nizamuddin Auliya.
Other important Persian poets were Mir Hasan
Dehlawi Badra Chach, etc.
Apart from poetry a strong school of history
writing in Persian developed in Indna during the
period. The most famous historians of the period
were Zia-ud-din Barani, Shams-i-Shiraj Afif and
Isami. Zia Nakshabi was the first to translate
Sanskrit works into Persian. His book Tuti
Namah (book of the parrot), written in the time
of Muhammad Tughluq, was Persian translation
of Sanskrit stories which were related by a parrot
to a woman whose husband had gone on a
journey. Zia also translated the old Indian
treatise on sexology, the Kok Sastra, into Persian.
Later, in the time of Firoz, Sanskrit books on
medicine and music were translated into Persian.
Sultan Zian-ul-Abidin of Kashmir had the
famous historical work, Rajatarangini, and the
Mahabharata translated into Persian. Sanskrit
works on medicine and music were also
translated into Persian at his instance.
