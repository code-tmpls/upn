<h3>Emergence of Regional States in India</h3>




The Delhi Sultanate expanded as a result of
the annexation of the states like Bengal, Bihar,
Gujarat, Malwa, various Rajput states of
Rajasthan, like Ranthambor, Jalore, Nagore,
Ajmer, the Deccan states of Warangal,
Telengana, Yadavas of Deogir, and the southern
states of the Hoysalas of Dwarsamudra, Pandyas
of Madurai, and so on. We have already studied
about the various campaigns of Alauddin Khalji
and the shift of capital from Delhi to Daultabad
in the Deccan, during Mohammad bin Tughlaq's
period. Those states that were annexed to the
Sultanate formed various provinces and were
placed under the administration of the provincial
governors. From the establishment of the Delhi
Sultanate in the thirteenth century till its
downfall in the fifteenth century, there was a
constant interaction between the provinces that
were once upon a time independent states and
the centre, that is, Delhi. However, rebellions
from these areas never seized. We all know that
as a prince, Muhammmad bin Tughlaq spent his
entire career in crushing the rebellions in the
Deccan, Orissa and Bengal.
<br>
<br>
Though these regions were now a part of the
Delhi Sultanate, the regional characteristics of
language, art, literature and religion remained.
In fact, when Islam reached here, it acquired a
regional flavour. These states already had
settlements of Muslim merchants and Muslims
employed in the army. Though there was hardly
any regional ruling dynasty, the provincial
governors of the Sultanate allied with the local
rajas and zamindars and asserted their
independence. Most of the regional states that
came up after the fourteenth century when the
Delhi Sultanate was declining were a result of
the rebellions of the governors. The establishment
of Vijayanagar and the Bahamani were a result
of the assertion of power by the provincial
officers, like Harihara and Bukka and Alauddin
Hasan Bahman Shah respectively. During the
same period, Bengal in the east and Multan and
Sind in the west became independent. Feroz
Shah Tughlaq tried to regain the lost territories
but could not do so. He tried unsuccessfully to
take over Bengal. He attacked and plundered
Jajnagar (Orissa) but did not annex it. He
plundered Kangra and suppressed revolts in
Gujarat and Thatta.
With the death of Feroz Shah Tughlaq in
1338, the decline of the Sultanate began. As we
have just mentioned, a large number of local
governors became powerful and asserted their
independence in the provinces. The relationship
between the Sultan and the nobles worsened.
The conflict with the local rulers and zamindars
as well as regional and geographical tensions
weakened the Sultanate further. The declining
Sultanate received the final blow with the
invasions of Timur in 1398 AD. Timur was a
Turk who had come from Central Asia to
plunder the wealth of India. Timur entered Delhi
and mercilessly killed both the Hindus and
Muslims and massacred women and children as
well.
<br>
<br>
Fifteen years after the Timur's raids in Delhi,
the Delhi Sultanate declined. The Sultanates in
Gujarat, Malwa and Jaunpur near Varanasi
emerged as powerful regional kingdom. Gujarat
and Jaunpur were constantly engaged in tension
with the Lodhis of the Delhi Sultanate (1451 to
1526 AD). New regional states independent of
the Delhi sultanate arose in Central and South
India too, out of which the prominent ones were
the Gajapatis of Orissa, the Bahamanis and the
Vijayanagara Empire. The Lodhi Sultans like
Bahlol Lodhi (1451-1485) and Sikander Lodhi
(1489-1526) tried to keep these regional
kingdoms under control.
Finally, during the rule of Ibrahim Lodhi
(1517-1526), Bihar declared its independence.
Daulat Khan, the governor of Punjab rebelled
and invited Babur to invade India in 1526.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GUJARAT</i></strong></div>

On account of the excellence of its
handicrafts and its flourishing seaports, as well
as the richness of its soil, Gujarat was one of the
richest provinces of the Delhi Sultanate. After
Timur's invasion of Delhi, both Gujarat and
Malwa become independent in all but name.
However, it was not till 1407 that Zafar Khan
formally proclaimed himself the ruler, with the
title Muzaffar Shah (1392-1410).
The real founder of the kingdom of Gujarat
was, however, Ahmad Shah I (1411-43), the
grandson of Muzaffar Shah. During his long
reign, he brought the nobility undr control,
settled the administration and expanded and
consolidated the kingdom. He shifted the capital
from Patan to the new city of Ahmedabad, the
foundation of which he laid in 1413. He was a
great builder, and beautified the town with many
magnificent places and bazars, mosques and
madrasas. He drew on the rich architectural
traditions of the jains of Gujarat to devise a style
of building which was markedly different from
Delhi. Some of its features were: slender turrets,
exquisite stone-carvings, and highly ornate
brackets. The jama Masjid in Ahamdabad and
the Tin Darwaza are fine examples of the style
of architecture during his time.
The most famous Sultan of Gujarat was
Mahmud Begarha. Mahmud Begarha ruled over
Gujarat for more than 50 years (from 1458 to
1511). he was called begarha because he
captured two of the most powerful forts (garhs),
Girnar in Saurashtra (now called junagarh) and
cmapaner in south Gujarat.
Mahmud Begarha also had to deal with the
Portuguese who were interfering with Gujarat's
trade with the countries of west Asia. He joined
handa with the ruler of Egypt to check the
portuguese naval power, but he was not
successful.
<br>
<br>
Many works were translated from Arabic
into Persian during his reign. His court poet was
udayaraja who composed in Sanskrit. Mahmud
Begarha had a striking appearance. He had a
flowing beared which reached uptl his waist,
and his moustache was so long that he tied it
over his head. According to a traveller Barbosa,
from his childhood, Mahmud had been
nourished on some poison so that if a fly settled
on his hand, it swelled and immediately lay
dead. Mahmud was also famous for his
voracious appetite. It is said that for breakfast
he ate a cup of honey, a cup of butter and one
hundred to one hundred and fifty plantains. He
ate 10 to 15 kilos of food a day and we are told
that plates of meat patties (samosas) were laced
on both sides of his pillow at night in case he felt
hungry! Under Mahmud Begarha, the Gujarat
kingdom reached its zenith and emerged as one
of the most powerful and well administered
states in the country.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JAUNPUR</i></strong></div>

Jaunpur is now in Varanasi division in
eastern Uttar Pradesh on the banks of river
Gomati. It was a prosperous province in the
eastern part of the Delhi Sultanate. The governor
of Jaunpur was Malik Sarwar, who was a
prominent noble during Feroz Shah Tughlaq's
period. In 1394, Sultan Nasiruddin Mohammad
Shah Tughlaq made him a minister and gave him
the title of Sultanu-Sharq which means the
master of the east. Thereafter, he was known as
Malik Sarwar Sultanus Sharq. After Timur's
invasion and the weakening of the Delhi
Sultanate, Malik Sarwar took advantage of a
weak political situation and declared himself
independent. Malik Sarwar was succeeded by
his son Mubarak Shah Sharqi. The Sultan struck
coins in his name.
<br>
<br>
During his period, the ruler of the Delhi
sultanate was Mahmud Shah Tughlaq, who tried
to annex Jaunpur, but failed. Thereafter, there
were constant tensions between the various
rulers of Jaunpur and Delhi Sultanate. The
Sharqi Sultans made several attempts to conquer
Delhi, but they could never be successful. In
1402, Ibrahim Shah Sharqi, Mubarak Shah's
brother became the Sultan and ruled Jaunpur
for thirty four years. Ibrahim was also a scholar,
well versed with Islamic theology and law, music
and fine arts. He was a great patron of
architecture. A distinct style of architecture
evolved called the Sharqi style that had some
Hindu influence. At its height, the Sharqi
Sultanate extended from Aligarh in western
Uttar Pradesh to Darbhanga in north Bihar in
the east and from Nepal in the north to
Bundelkhand in the south. It was during the
reign of Hussain Shah Sharqi (1458-1505) that a
prolonged war with Bahlol Lodhi started. Bahlol
Lodhi attacked Jaunpur in 1484 and Hussain
Shah had to flee. Finally, Sikandar Lodhi who
succeeded Bahlol Lodhi annexed Jaunpur.
Hussain Shah died and the Sharqi dynasty came
to an end.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>KASHMIR</i></strong></div>

Kashmir is in the northern part of India. In
the eleventh century, the rulers were followers
of Saivism, and Saivism became the central
religion in Kashmir. It was a closed kingdom.
Albiruni, the Arab traveller who visited India
during this period remarked in his work, AlHind that no one, not even Hindus from outside
was allowed access to Kashmir. In 1320s, the
ruling dynasty of Kashmir could not check the
devastating Mongol invasions. It therefore, lost
all public support. In 1339, Shamsuddin Shah
deposed the Saiva ruler and became the ruler of
Kashmir. From this period onwards, Islam
influenced the Kashmiri society. A group of Sufi
saints known as the Rishis propagated a religion
that combined features of Hinduism and Islam
Sufi saints and refugees migrated from Central
Asia to Kashmir and further influenced the
society and religion. Gradually, the poorer
section of the population started converting to
Islam. The state encouragement to Islam took
place when the Kashmiri Sultan, Sikandar Shah
(1389-1413), issued an order that all Hindus
especially, the brahmanas living in his kingdom
should embrace Islam or leave his kingdom.
It is said that these orders were issued at the
instance of the king's minister, Suha Bhatt who
was a Hindu and had recently converted to Islam.
Perhaps, one of the greatest rulers of Kashmir
was Zainul Abidin (1420-1470). He was an
enlightened ruler and called back those Hindus
who had left the state due to the persecution of
Sikandar Shah. He abolished jaziya and
prohibited cow slaughter and gave the Hindus
important state posts. A large number of temples
were repaired and new ones constructed.
Abul Fazl, the court historian of the Mughal
Emperor Akbar noted that Kashmir had one
hundred and fifty big temples. Sultan Zainul
Abidin married the daughters of the Hindu raja
of Jammu. Some scholars call Zainul Abidin as
the Akbar of Kashmir. Under him, Kashmir
became prosperous and he was called the Bud
Shah or the great king of Kashmiris.
The Sultan contributed to the agricultural
development of Kashmir by constructing dams
and canals. Agricultural records were maintained. During the period of famine and other
natural calamities, relief in terms of loans and
grains and fodder was provided to the peasants.
Sultan also introduced reforms in the currency.
He introduced market control and fixed prices
of the commodities. Traders and merchants were
asked to sell the commodities at fixed prices.
Sultan also subsidized the import of the commodities which were scarce in the state. To make
up for the shortage of salt, he imported salt from
Ladakh and helped the traders in every possible
way. Sultan also paid attention to the development of handicrafts. He sent some people to Samarqand for training of paper making and book
binding. Sultan also encouraged stone cutting
and polishing and many other crafts. He introduced carpet and shawl making, which make
Kashmir famous till day. Sultan also founded the
towns of Zaingir, Zainket and Zainpur and laid
out the islands on the Dal Lake that can be seen
till today. His chief engineering achievement was
the Zaina Lanka, an artificial island in the Woolur Lake on which he built his palace and
mosque.
<br>
<br>
He was a great scholar of Persian, Sanskrit,
Tibetan and Arab languages and patronised the
Sanskrit and Persian scholars. Under his
patronage, the Mahabharat and Kalhana's
Rajatarangini were translated into Persian and
many Persian and Arabic works were translated
into Hindi. He himself was a poet and wrote
poetry under the pen name 'Qutb'.
After him weak rulers ascended the throne
of Kashmir and there was confusion. Taking
advantage of this, Mirza Haider, Babur's relative
occupied Kashmir. In 1586, Akbar conquered
Kashmir and made it a part of the Mughal
Empire.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BENGAL</i></strong></div>

Bengal was an important regional kingdom
under the Palas in the eighth century and the
Senas in the twelfth century. Bengal was the
easternmost province of the Delhi Sultanate. The
long distance, uncomfortable climate and poor
means of transport and communications made
it difficult for the Delhi Sultanate to control this
province. Therefore, it was easy for Bengal to
assert its independence. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq
tried to solve the problem by partitioning Bengal
into three independent administrative divisions:
Lakhnauti, Satgaon and Sonargaon. However,
the problems remained and finally Bengal
emerged as an independent regional state in the
fourteenth century.
<br>
<br>
In 1342, one of the nobles, Haji Ilyas Khan
united Bengal and became its ruler under the
title of Shamsh-ud-din Iliyas Shah and laid the
foundation of the Ilyas Shah dynasty. He tried
to annex Bengal and raided Orissa and Tirhut
and forced them to pay tribute. Such expansions
alarmed the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate, who
tried to occupy Bengal several times but were
not successful. One of the important rulers of
the Ilyas Shah dynasty was Ghiyasuddin Azam.
He was a learned man and promoted Persian
literature. He was well known for dispensing free
and fair justice to people. It is said that once he
killed a son of a widow by accident. The widow
filed a complaint with Qazi who summoned the
ruler to the court. When the case was decided,
Azam told the Qazi that had he not discharged
his duties honestly he would have killed him.
Azam had cordial relations with China. There
was a prosperous trading relationship between
Bengal and China. The port of Chittagaong was
an important centre for exchange of goods. On
demand from the king of China, Azam also sent
Buddhist monks from Bengal. Pandua and Gaur
were the capitals of Bengal.
<br>
<br>
In 1538, Bengal was annexed by Sher Shah
Suri. In 1586, Akbar conquered Bengal, and
made it into a suba. While Persian was the
language of administration, Bengali developed
as a regional language. The establishment of
Mughal control over Bengal coincided with the
rise of agrarian settlements in the forested and
marshy areas of southeastern Bengal. Soon after,
with the spread of rice cultivation, this area
became heavily populated with the local
communities of fisher folks and peasants. The
Mughals established their capital in the heart of
the eastern delta at Dhaka. Officials and
functionaries received land grants and settled
there. Alauddin Hussain Shah (1439 to 1519)
was another important ruler of Bengal. He was
very efficient, and gave high administrative posts
to the Hindus and is said to have paid respect to
Chaitanya of the Vaisnava sect. He came into
conflict with Sikandar Lodhi and had to make
peace with him.
<br>
<br>
This was a fertile and prosperous province.
It had flourishing seaports and was famous for
its handicrafts. Alauddin Khalji was the first
Sultan to annex it to Delhi Sultanate and since
then it remained under the Turkish governors
of the Sultanate. After Timur's invasion, in 1407,
Zafar Khan who was then the governor became
the independent ruler and after sometime
assumed the title of Muzaffar Shah. Zafar
Khan's father was a Rajput who had given his
sister in marriage to Feroz Shah Tughlaq.
Ahmad Shah (1411-1441), was one of the
important rulers of Gujarat. He founded the city
of Ahmadabad and made it his capital in 1413.
He built beautiful buildings, like Jama Masjid and
Teen Darwaza and beautified the city with
gardens, palaces and bazaars.
Ahmad Shah was influenced by the Jaina
architectural traditions of Gujarat. He was an
efficient administrator and consolidated the
regional state of Gujarat. He subdued the Rajput
states, Jhalawar, Bundi and Durgapur. He was
supposed to be an orthodox Muslim who
imposed jaziya on the Hindus and destroyed
several temples. However, the picture was
complex. At the same time, he appointed Hindus
to important administrative positions. Ahmad
Shah fought equally fiercely against the Hindu
as well as the Muslim rulers. His main enemy
were the Muslim rulers of Malwa. The rivalry
between Gujarat and Malwa was bitter and
prevented both the regional states from
concentrating on larger political gains in north
Indian politics. He was famous for imparting
justice. He publicly executed his son-in-law who
had murdered an innocent. The author of Mirati-Ahmadi has rightly said that the impact of this
justice lasted till his reign.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the most important ruler of Gujarat
was Mahmud Begarha. He was called Mahmud
Begarha as he had captured two powerful forts
or garh, Girnar (Junagarh) in Saurashtra and the
fort of Champaner from the Rajputs in south
Gujarat. Both these forts were of strategic
importance. The fort of Girnar was in the
prosperous Saurahstra region and also provided
a base for operations against Sindh. The Sultan
founded a new town called Mustafabad at the
foot of the hill. This town with many beautiful
monuments became the second capital of
Gujarat. Similarly, the fort of Champaner was
crucial to control Malwa and Khandesh.
Mahmud constructed a new town called
Muhammadabad near Champaner.
<br>
<br>
According to another version, he was called
Begarha as his moustaches resembled the horns
of a cow (begarha). Mahmud is supposed to have
had a flowing beard which reached up to his
waist. His moustache was supposed to be so long
that he tied it over his head. According to a
foreign traveller, Duarto Barbosa, right from his
childhood, Mahmud was given some poison as
his food which made him so poisonous that if a
fly settled on his head, it would meet instant
death. Mahmud was also famous for huge
appetite. It is said that for breakfast he ate a cup
of honey, a cup of butter and one hundred to
hundred and fifty bananas. In total, he
consumed ten to fifteen kilos of food everyday.
Mahmud Begarha ruled for 52 years. He was
also a great patron of art and literature. Many
works were translated from Arabic to Persian
in his court. His court poet was Udayaraja, who
composed poetry in Sanskrit.
In 1507, Mahmud led an expedition against
the Portuguese who had settled on the western
coast and monopolised the trade there, causing
immense harm to the Muslim traders. To break
the Portuguese trade monopoly he sought the
help of the Sultan of Turkey but could not get
much headway and finally had to give the
Portuguese a site for a factory in Diu. He died in
1511. During the rule of his successors Akbar
conquered and annexed Gujarat in 1572 AD.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>VIJAYANAGAR EMPIRE</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political History</i></strong></div>


Vijayanagar was founded in 1336 by
Harihara and Bukka of the Sangama dynasty.
They were originally served under the Kakatiya
rulers of Warangal. Then they went to Kampili
where they were imprisoned and converted to
Islam. Later, they returned to the Hindu fold at
the initiative of the saint Vidyaranya. They also
proclaimed their independence and founded a
new city on the south bank of the Tungabhadra
river. It was called Vijayanagar meaning city of
victory. The decline of the Hoysala kingdom
enabled Harihara and Bukka to expand their
newly founded kingdom. By 1346, they brought
the whole of the Hoysala kingdom under their
control. The struggle between Vijayanagar and
Sultanate of Madurai lasted for about four
decades. Kumarakampana's expedition to
Madurai was described in the Maduravijayam.
He destroyed the Madurai Sultans and as a
result, the Vijayanagar Empire comprised the
whole of South India up to Rameswaram.
The conflict between Vijayanagar Empire
and the Bahmani kingdom lasted for many years.
The dispute over Raichur Doab, the region
between the rivers Krishna and Tungabhadra
and also over the fertile areas of KrishnaGodavari delta led to this long- drawn conflict.
The greatest ruler of the Sangama dynasty was
Deva Raya II. But he could not win any clear
victory over the Bahmani Sultans. After his
death, Sangama dynasty became weak. The next
dynasty, Saluva dynasty founded by Saluva
Narasimha reigned only for a brief period (1486-
1509).



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Krishna Deva Raya (1509 - 1530)</i></strong></div>

The Tuluva dynasty was founded by Vira
Narasimha. The greatest of the Vijayanagar
rulers, Krishna Deva Raya belonged to the
Tuluva dynasty. He possessed great military
ability. His imposing personality was
accompanied by high intellectual quality. His
first task was to check the invading Bahmani
forces. By that time the Bahmani kingdom was
replaced by Deccan Sultanates. The Muslim
armies were decisively defeated in the battle of
Diwani by Krishna Deva Raya. Then he invaded
Raichur Doab which had resulted in the
confrontation with the Sultan of Bijapur, Ismail
Adil Shah. But, Krishna Deva Raya defeated
him and captured the city of Raichur in 1520.
From there he marched on Bidar and captured
it.
<br>
<br>
Krishna Deva Raya's Orissa campaign was
also successful. He defeated the Gajapathi ruler
Prataparudra and conquered the whole of Telungana. He maintained friendly relations with
the Portuguese. Albuquerque sent his ambassadors to Krishna Deva Raya.
Though a Vaishnavaite, he respected all
religions. He was a great patron of literature and
art and he was known as Andhra Bhoja. Eight
eminent scholars known as Ashtadiggajas were
at his royal court. Allasani Peddanna was the
greatest and he was called Andhrakavita
Pitamaga. His important works include
Manucharitam and Harikathasaram. Pingali
Suranna and Tenali Ramakrishna were other
important scholars. Krishna Deva Raya himself
authored a Telugu work, Amukthamalyadha
and Sanskrit works, Jambavati Kalyanam and
Ushaparinayam.
<br>
<br>
He repaired most of the temples of south
India. He also built the famous Vittalaswamy and
Hazara Ramaswamy temples at Vijayanagar.
He also built a new city called Nagalapuram in
memory of his queen Nagaladevi. Besides, he
built a large number of Rayagopurams.
After his death, Achutadeva and Venkata
succeeded the throne. During the reign of Rama
Raya, the combined forces of Bijapur,
Ahmadnagar, Golkonda and Bidar defeated him
at the Battle of Talaikotta in 1565. This battle is
also known as Raksasa Thangadi. Rama Raya
was imprisoned and executed. The city of
Vijayanagar was destroyed. This battle was
generally considered to mark the end of the
Vijayanagar Empire. However, the Vijayanagar
kingdom existed under the Aravidu dynasty for
about another century. Thirumala, Sri Ranga
and Venkata II were the important rulers of this
dynasty. The last ruler of Vijayanagar kingdom
was Sri Ranga III.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Administration</i></strong></div>

The administration under the Vijayanagar
Empire was well organized. The king enjoyed
absolute authority in executive, judicial and
legislative matters. He was the highest court of
appeal. The succession to the throne was on the
principle of hereditary. Sometimes usurpation to
the throne took place as Saluva Narasimha came
to power by ending the Sangama dynasty. The
king was assisted by a council of ministers in his
day to day administration. The Empire was
divided into different administrative units called
Mandalams, Nadus, sthalas and finally into
gramas. The governor of Mandalam was called
Mandaleswara or Nayak. Vijayanagar rulers
gave full powers to the local authorities in the
administration.
<br>
<br>
Besides land revenue, tributes and gifts from
vassals and feudal chiefs, customs collected at
the ports, taxes on various professions were other
sources of income to the government. Land
revenue was fixed generally one sixth of the
produce. The expenditure of the government
includes personal expenses of king and the
charities given by him and military expenditure.
In the matter of justice, harsh punishments such
as mutilation and throwing to elephants were
followed.
<br>
<br>
The Vijayanagar army was well-organized
and efficient. It consisted of the cavalry, infantry,
artillery and elephants. High-breed horses were
procured from foreign traders. The top-grade
officers of the army were known as Nayaks or
Poligars. They were granted land in lieu of their
services. These lands were called amaram.
Soldiers were usually paid in cash.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Life</i></strong></div>

Allasani Peddanna in his Manucharitam
refers the existence of four castes - Brahmins,
Kshatriyas, Vaisyas and Sudras - in the
Vijayanagar society. Foreign travelers left vivid
accounts on the splendour of buildings and
luxurious social life in the city of Vijayanagar.
Silk and cotton clothes were mainly used for
dress. Perfumes, flowers and ornaments were
used by the people. Paes mentions of the
beautiful houses of the rich and the large number
of their household servants. Nicolo Conti refers
to the prevalence of slavery. Dancing, music,
wrestling, gambling and cock-fighting were
some of the amusements. Chidambaram speak
the glorious epoch of Vijayanagar. They were
continued by the Nayak rulers in the later period.
The metal images of Krishna Deva Raya and his
queens at Tirupati are examples for casting of
metal images. Music and dancing were also
patronized by the rulers of Vijayanagar.
Different languages such as Sanskrit, Telugu,
Kannada and Tamil flourished in the regions.
There was a great development in Sanskrit and
Telugu literature. The peak of literary
achievement was reached during the reign of
Krishna Deva Raya. He himself was a scholar in
Sanskrit and Telugu. His famous court poet
Allasani Peddanna was distinguished in Telugu
literature. Thus the cultural contributions of the
Vijayanagar rulers were many-sided and
remarkable.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sources</i></strong></div>

The history of Vijayanagar Empire constitutes
an important chapter in the history of India.
Four dynasties - Sangama, Saluva, Tuluva and
Aravidu - ruled Vijayanagar from A.D. 1336 to
1672. The sources for the study of Vijayanagar
are varied such as literary, archaeological and
numismatics. Krishnadevaraya's Amukthamalyada, Gangadevi's Maduravijayam and Allasani
Peddanna's Manucharitam are some of the indigenous literature of this period.
Many foreign travelers visited the
Vijayanagar Empire and their accounts are also
valuable. The Moroccan traveler, Ibn Battuta,
Venetian traveler Nicolo de Conti, Persian
traveler Abdur Razzak and the Portuguese
traveler Domingo Paes were among them who
left valuable accounts on the socio-economic
conditions of the Vijayanagar Empire. The
copper plate inscriptions such as the Srirangam
copper plates of Devaraya II provide the
genealogy and achievements of Vijayanagar
rulers. The Hampi ruins and other monuments
of Vijayanagar provide information on the
cultural contributions of the Vijayanagar rulers.
The numerous coins issued by the Vijayanagar
rulers contain figures and legends explaining
their tittles and achievements.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bahmani Kingdom</i></strong></div>

The Deccan region was a part of the
provincial administration of the Delhi Sultanate.
In order to establish a stable administration in
the Deccan, Mohammad bin Tughlaq appointed
amiran-i-sada/ Sada Amir, who were the
administrative heads of hundred villages. From
1337 the conflict between the officers in Deccan
and Delhi sultanate accelerated. This led to the
establishment of an independent state in the
Deccan in 1347 with the capital at Gulbarga in
Andhra Pradesh. Its founders Hasan Gangu
assumed the title Alauddin Hasan Bahman Shah
as he traced his descent from the mythical hero
of Iran, Bahman Shah and the kingdom was
named after him, the Bahamani Sultanate. After
Mohammad bin Tughlaq there were no attempts
by the Delhi Sultanate to control the Deccan
region. Therefore, the Bahamani Sultans without
any checks annexed the kingdom.
<br>
<br>
There were a total of fourteen Sultans ruling
over this kingdom. Among them, Alauddin
Bahman Shah, Muhammad Shah I and Firoz
Shah were important. Ahmad Wali Shah shifted
the capital from Gulbarga to Bidar. The power
of the Bahmani kingdom reached its peak under
the rule of Muhammad Shah III. It extended from
the Arabian sea to the Bay of Bengal. On the
west it extended from Goa to Bombay. On the
east, it extended from Kakinada to the mouth of
the river Krishna. The success of Muhammad
Shah was due to the advice and services of his
minister Mahmud Gawan. One of the important
acquisitions was the control over Dabhol, an
important port on the west coast.
Under Bahman Shah and his son
Muhammmad Shah, the administrative system
was well organised. The kingdom was divided
into four administrative units called 'taraf' or
provinces. These provinces were Daultabad,
Bidar, Berar and Gulbarga. Muhammad I
defeated the Vijayanagar kingdom and
consequently Golconda was annexed to
Bahamani kingdom. Every province was under
a tarafdar who was also called a subedar. Some
land was converted into Khalisa land from the
jurisdiction of the tarafdar. Khalisa land was
that piece of land which was used to run
expenses of the king and the royal household.
Further the services and the salary of every noble
was fixed. Those nobles who kept 500 horses
were given 1000,000 huns annually. If short of
the stipulated troops, the tarafdar would have
to reimburse the amount to the central
government. Nobles used to get their salary either
in cash or in form of grant of land or 'jagir'
Bahamani ruler depended for military support
on his amirs. There were two groups in the ranks
of amirs: One was the Deccanis who were
immigrant Muslims and had been staying for a
long time in the Deccan region. The other group
was Afaquis or Pardesis who had recently come
from Central Asia, Iran and Iraq and had settled
in the Deccan region recently. Between both
these groups there was always tension to
appropriate better administrative positions.
Because of their feuds, the stability of the
Bahamani Sultanate was affected. For the first
time in India both these kingdoms used
gunpowder in the warfare. The Bahamanis were
already familiar with the use of firearms. They
employed Turkish and Portuguese experts to
train the soldiers in the latest weaponry of
warfare.
<br>
<br>
One of the most important personalities in
the Bahamani kingdom was Mahmud Gawan.
Mahmud Gawan's early life is obscure. He was
an Iranian by birth and first reached Deccan as
a trader. He was granted the title of 'Chief of the
Merchants' or Malikut-Tujjar by the Bahamani
ruler, Humayun Shah. The sudden death of
Humayun led to the coronation of his minor son
Ahmad III. A regency council was set for the
administration and Mahmud Gawan was its
important member. He was made wazir or the
prime minister and was given the title of
'Khwaju-i-Jahan.' The history of Bahmani
kingdom after this period is actually the record
of the achievements of Mahmud Gawan. Despite
of being an Afaqui he was liberal and wanted a
compromise between the Afaquis and the
Deccanis. He controlled the kingdom in an
efficient manner and provided it stability. Gawan
conquered the Vijayanagar territories up to
Kanchi. On the western coast, Goa and Dhabol
were conquered. Losing these important ports
was a great loss for Vijayanagar. Bahamani
strengthened its trading relations with Iran and
Iraq after gaining control over Goa and Dabhol.
Gawan carried out many internal reforms
and attempted to put an end to the strife in the
nobility. In order to curb the military power of
the tarafdar, Gawan ordered that only one fort
of each province was to be under the direct
control of the provincial tarafdar. The remaining
forts of the province were placed under a Qiladar
or commander of the forts. The Qiladar was
appointed by the central Government. However,
soon after his death, the governors declared their
independence and the Bahamani kingdom broke
up. In the fifteenth and the sixteenth century,
some amirs in Bidar, Ahmadnagar, Golconda
and Bijapur and Berar established independent
sultanates of their own and formed new states.
These were the Nizam Shahis of Ahmadnagar,
the Adil Shahis of Bijapur, the Qutb Shahis of
Golconda, and the Imad Shahis of Berar and the
Barid Shahis of Bidar. They formed a league of
states and strengthened them by matrimonial
alliances. They maintained the traditional rivalry
with the Vijayanagar rulers. Golconda and
Bijapur entered into matrimonial alliances and
led the Battle of Talikota against Vijayanagar.
They finally succumbed to the Mughal armies.
The Sufis were greatly venerate by the
Banmani rulers. Initially, they migrated to the
Deccan as religious auxiliaries. of the Khaljis and
the Tughluqs the infant Bahmani kingdom
required the support of the Sufies for popular
legitimiation of their authrotiry, the Sufis who
migrated to the bahmani kingdom were chiefly
of the Dhishti, Qadiria and Shattari orders. Bidar
emerged as one of the most important centres of
the Qadiri ordr. Syed Muhammad Gesu Baraz,
the famous Chishti saint of Delhi, migrated to
Gulbaraga in 1402-3, enjoyed the greatest
honour.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Malwa and Mewar</i></strong></div>

The state of Malwa was situated on the high
plateau between the rivers Narmada and Tapti
It commanded the trunk routes between Gujarat
and northern India, as also between Gujarat and
north and south India. As long as Malwa
continued to be strong, it acted as a barrier to
the ambitions of Gujarat, Mewar, the Bahmanis
and the Lodi Sultans of Delhi.
During the fifteenth century, the kingdom
of Malwa remained at the height of its glory, The
capital was shifted from Dhar to Mandu, a
phace which was highly defensible and which
had a great deal of natural beauty. Here, the
rulers of Malwa constructed a large number of
buildings, the ruins of which are still impressive.
Unlide the Gujarat style of architecture, the
Mndu architecture was massive and was made
to look even more so by using a very lofty plinth
for the buildings. The large-scale use of coloured
and glazed tiles provided variety to the buildings.
The best known among them are jama Masjid,
the Hindola Mahal and the Jahaz Mahal.
One of the early rulers of Malwa, Hushang
shah, adopted a broad policy of religious
toleration. Hushang shah extended his
patronage to the Jains who were the principal
commercial merchants and banders of the era.
Thus, Nardeva Soni, a successful merchant, was
the treasurer of Hushang Shah, and one fo his
advisers. Mohmud Khalji (1436-69), who is
considered the most powerful of the Malwa
rulers, destroyed many temples during his
struggle with Rana Kumbha of Mewar, and with
the neighboring Hindu rajas.
<br>
<br>
This rise of mewar during the fifteenth
century was an important factor in the political
life of north India. With the comquest of
Ranthambhar by Alauddin Khalji, the power of
the Chauhans in Rajputana had finally come to
an end. From its ruins, a number of new states
arose. The state of Marwar with its capital at
jodhpur (founded 1465) was one of these.
Another state of consequence in the area was
the Muslim principality of Nagaur. Anmer which
had been the seat of power of the Mulsim
governors change hands several times, and was
a born of contention among the rising Rajput
states.
The early history of the state of Mewar is
obscure. Though it dated back to the eight
century, the ruler who raised it to the status of a
power to be reckoned with was Rana Kumbha
(1433-68AD). After cautiously consolidating his
position by defeating his internal rivals, Kumbha
embarked upon the conquest of Bundi, Kotah,
and Dungarpur on the Gujarat Border.
Marwar was under Mewar occupation, but
soon it become independent after a successful
struggle waged under the leadership of Rao
Jodha.
<br>
<br>
Kumbha was a patron of learned men, and
was himself one. He composed a number of
books, some of which can still be read. The ruins
of his palace and the victory tower (kirti
stambha) which he built at chittor show that he
was an enthusiastic builder as well. Hi dug
several lakes and reservoirs for irrigation
purposes. Some of the temples built during his
period show that the art of stome-cutting,
sculpture, Some of the temples built during his
period show that the art of stone cutting,
sculpture, etc., were still at a high level.
Kumbha was murdered by his son, Uda,
who wanted to gain the throne. Though Uda
was soon ousted, he left a bitter trail. After a
long fratricidal conflict with his brothers, Rana
Sanga (1509-28), a grandson of Kumbha,
ascended the gaddi of Mewar in 1509. The most
important development between the death of
Kumbha and the rise of Sanga was the rapid
internal disintegration of Malwa. The ruler,
Mahmud II, had fallen out with medini Rai, the
powerful Rajput leader of eastern Malwa who
had helped him to gain the throne. the malwa
ruler appealed for help to Gujarat, while Medini
Rai repaired to the court of Rana Sanga. In a
battle in 1517, the Rana defeated Mahmud II and
carried him a prisoner to Chittor but it is claimed
he released him after six month, keeping one of
his sons as a hostage, Eastern Malwa, including
Chanderi, passed under the overlordship of
Rans Sanga.
<br>
<br>
The developments in Malwa alarmed the
Lodi rulers of Delhi who were keenly watching
the situation. The Lodi ruler, Ibrahim Lodi,
invaded Mewar, but suffered a sharp reverse at
the handa of Rana Sanga at Ghatoli. IbrahimLidi
withdrew in order ot consolideat his internal
position. Meanwhile, Babur was knocking at the
gates of India.
<br>
<br>
Thus, by 1525, the political situation in north
India was changing rapidly, and a deccisive
conflict for supermacy in north India seemed to
be ineviatble. Rana Sanga was defeated by Babur
in the battle of Khanua in 1527.
GROWTH OF REGIONAL LITERATURE
One of the greatest impact that the rise of
the bhakti movement during the medieval period
had on the cultural patterns of different regions
was the growth of regional literature, either
through mystic saints or sometime under the
patronage of regional states.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hindi</i></strong></div>

The Hindi language probably prospered
under the influence of Bhakti saints in the early
medieval period. First stage of Hindi literature,
known as adi kala (1206-13-18) was the richest
period in the history of Hindi literature. Major
contribution wave made by nirguna and saguna
saint- poets and mystic poets. Nirguna saintpoets were Kabir, Guru Nanak, Dadu
Sundaradasa, etc. Mystic poets were Jayasi
(Padamavati), Nur Muhammad (Indravati),
Uthman (Chitravali), etc. Several secular poets
like Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan also
contributed to the growth of Hindi. The Third
stage, known as riti kla (riti means love) and
covering the period 1643-1850, was essentially
secular. The important poets of this period were
Kesavadasa, Chintamani, Mati Rama, Bihari, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Urdu</i></strong></div>

Urdu emerged due to the interaction of
Persian and Indian language in the military
camps of Alauddin Khalji. The Deccan was the
cradle of Urdu and the language flourished first
in the kingdoms of Bijapur and Golconda. The
earliest available work in Deccan Urdu is a
mystical prose treatise, Mirajul- Ashiqin by saint
Gesu Daraz (early 15th century). Shah Miranji
Shamsul (Khush Namah) and Burhanuddin
Janam (Irshad Namah) of Bijapur, Muhammad
Quli and Ghawasi (Tuti Namah) of Golconda
were the most famous Urdu writers of the
Deccan. Urdu arrived in north India in a more
developed form during the Mughal period.
Hatim, Mitrza Jan-i-Janum, Mir Taqi,
Muhammad Rafi Sauda and Mir Hassan were
the most important Urdu writers of north India
in the 18th century.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bengali</i></strong></div>

Bengali literature was mainly in the form of
folk songs and influenced by the philosophy of
the Sahaja cult. The second stage began with the
Muslim conquest of Bengal in the 13th century
and continued till the end of the 17th century.
Three main trends in this stage were-Vaishnava
poetry-important poets were Chandidasa,
Chaitanya, Govindasa and Krishnadasa
Kaviraja (Chaitanaya Charitamruta in 16th
century); translations and adaptation from
classical Sanskrit-Kasirama (Mahabharata),
Kristtivasa Ojha (Ramayana) and other works;
mangal kavya form of poetry - sectarian in spirit,
it narrated the struggle of gods against their
rivals. Main contributors were Manikadatta and
Mukundarama.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Oriya</i></strong></div>

Although Oriya originated in the eighth
century, major works in the language appeared
only in the 13th and 14th centuries. Important
Oriya writers were Sarladasa (Mahabharata in
the 14th century), Balramadasa and
Jagannadadasa and Jagannadadasa belonged to
a group known as pacha sakha or the five
saassociates, of the 15th century. The bhakti
movement of Chaitanya and the Vaishnava
poets made a lasting influence on Oriya
literature.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Punjabi</i></strong></div>

Baba Farid (13th century), a mystic poet was
the pioneer of a new school of poetry in Punjabi,
A major contributions to Punjabi poetry towards
the end of the 15th century was made by Guru
Nanak. Later Sikh gurus also contributed to the
enrichment of Punjabi. Guru Arjun complied the
Adi Granth in 1904 and also wrote Sukhmani,
one of the longest and greatest of medieval mystic
poems. The contribution Guru Gobind Singh is
also invaluable. Punjabi prose made immense
progress and a number of religious and
philosophical works were translated from
Sanskrit to Punjabi between 1600 and 1800.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gujarati</i></strong></div>

The first phase from the 13th to 15th
centuries, was marked by two main forms-the
prabandha (narrative poem) and the mukta
(shorter poem); Important poets of this phase
were Sridhara and Bhima, exponents of the first
type and Rajasekhara, Jayasekhara and
Somasundara who wrote in the second type. The
second phase, from the 15th to 17th century, was
the golden age of Gujarati literature. Major
contributors during this period were Narasimha
Mehta, Bhalana and Akho.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Marathi</i></strong></div>

Marathi literature emerged in the latter of
the 13th century. A major contribution was
made by saint-poets of the Natha cult (founded
by Gorakhanatha) such as Mukundaraja (VivekSindhu). The saint- poets of the Mahanubhava
cult also contributed to Marathi prose and poetry
(like Lilachrita, Sidhanta Sutropatta, etc.) other
important contributors were Jananadeva
(Jnanesvari and Amritanubhava are sacred
books for Marathis), Eknatha, Tukaram
(abhangas), Ramdas and Vamana Pandit. The
17th century saw the compilation of secular
poetry in the form of povadas (ballads describing
the warfare skills and selfless valour of the
Marathas) and lavanis (romantic works).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Telugu</i></strong></div>

A group of poets called kavitraya were

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ART AND CULTURE</i></strong></div>

Regional styles of architecture came into
vogue usually after these states had thrown off
the allegiance to Delhi and proceeded to develop
and form to suit their individual requirements.
They were distinct form the Indo-Islamic style
practiced at Delhi and often displayed definitely
original qualities. In the areas which have a
strong indigenous tradition of workmanship in
masonry, regional styles of Islamic architecture
produced the most elegant structures. On the
other hand, where these traditions were not so
pronounced, the buildings constructed for the
regional states were less distinctive. In some cases
totally novel tendencies, independent of both the
indigenous and the imperial Sultanate traditions,
are also visible.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bengal</i></strong></div>

The establishment of an independent Muslim
power in Bengal took place within a gap of five
years since the capture of Delhi by the Turks.
But an independent building style, distinct from
the one prevalent at Delhi, developed at the
beginning of the fourteenth century and lasted
for a period of nearly 250 years. Bengali style
spread in all parts of the region, but most of the
prominent buildings were located within the
boundary of the Malwa district which had been
the strategic centre of the region due to the
confluence of the two rivers, the Ganga and the
Mahananda. Here lie the remains of the two
principal cities-Gaur and Pandua-which, in turn,
enjoyed the status of the capital seat of the
regional ruling style of this region we have to
depend mostly on the buildings extant in these
two cities and a few important examples
elsewhere. The Building art of Bengal is generally
divided into the following three phases of which
the first two are considered preliminary stages
and the third its ultimate development into a
specific style.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Jaunpur</i></strong></div>

The Sharqi kindom of Jaunpur was founded
by Malik Sarwar, a noble of Firuz Shah Tughlug,
in 1394. In the wake of Timur's invasion and
ransack of Delhi. Jaunpur took over from the
capital as a centre for scholars and writers. The
surviving buildings constructed under the
Sharqis are located in the capital city Jaunpur.
The Sharqi architecture of Jaunpur carries a
distinct impact of the Tughlug style., the
battering effect of its bastings and minarets and
the use of arch-and-beam combination in the
openings being the two most prominent features,
However, the most striking feature of the
Jaunpur style is the design of the façade of the
mosques. It is composed of lofty propylons with
sloping sides raised in the centre of the sanctuary
screen. The propylons consist of a huge recessed
arch ramed by tapering square minar, of
exceptional bulk and solidity, divided into
registers. The best examples can be seen in the
Atala Majid and the Jami Masjid. Evidently, the
propylon was the keynote of Jaunpur style and
occurs in no other manifestation of indo-Islamic
architecture.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gujarat</i></strong></div>

The regional style of architecture that came
into being in western India towards the
beginning of the 14th century is almost
exclusively confined to Gujarat.
The regional style flourished for a period of
some two hundred and fifty years beginning
early in the 14th century. The founders of the
Gujarat style of Indo-Islamic architecture were,
in facrt, the governors of the Khalji Sultans of
Delhi.
There were three different phases of the
Gujarat style:- The first phase lasting for the first
half of the 14th century marked by the
demolition of the Hindu temples and their
reconversion into Muslim buildings. The second
phase prevailing mostly during the first half of
the 15th century and showed signs of hesitant
maturity of a distinctive style. The third phase
was the matured phase of Gujarati architecture.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Malwa</i></strong></div>

In central India, the development of IndoIslamic architecture remained confined within
the Malwa regional which became an
independent kingdom at the turn of the 15th
century. The regional manifestations of IndoIslamic architecture in Malwa are located
essentially within the confines of two cities, Dhar
and Mandu, though some buildings may also be
seen at Chanderi. The Sultans of Dhar and
Mandu have left a rich architectureal legacy, the
main buildings being mosques, tombs and
palaces. The buildings at Dhar and Mandu
derive many features from the Tughluq
architecture such as the battered walls, fringed
arch and the arch-beam combination. But soon
we also notice the emergence of distinctive
features which give the Malwa style of
architecture a character of its own. Perhaps the
most important is an innovative technique by
which the two separate structural systems of the
arch and the lintel have been combined in Malwa
architecture. In no other early type of
architecture has this problem of using arch and
beam as structural elements been more
artistically solved. Another notable feature of the
Malwa buildings is the construction of stately
flights of steps of considerable length leading to
their entrances. This became necessary duet to
the use of unusually high plinths on which most
of the important buildings are raised. This
architectural impulse died in 1531 with defeat
of the last Malwa ruler, Mahmud II, at the hands
of Bahadur Shah of Gujarat. Malwa was
temporarily brought under the Mughals by
Humayun in 1535 and was finally conquered
by Akhar in 1564.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Deccan</i></strong></div>

The Indo-Islamic architecture that developed
in the Deccan from 14th century onwards under
the Bahmanis acquired a definitely regional
character quite early in its growth. But this
architecture followed a different pattern in
evolution than other regional styles. As opposed
to the growth of regional styles in northern India,
architecture in the Deccan seems to have ignored
to a very large extent the pre-Islamic art
traditions of the region.
In practice, the Deccan style of architecture
consisted basically of the fusion of; the
architectural system in vogue at Delhi under the
Sultans, particularly the Tughluq form and an
entirely extraneous source that is, the
architecture of Pesia.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bidar</i></strong></div>

The Bahmani capital was transferred to
Bidar, a fortress town in 1425 ruled by Ahman
Shah (1422-36). Soon the new capital saw a
flurry of building activity. Within its walls sprang
up palaces with large audience halls and
hammams, a madrasa, and royal tombs.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vijaynagar</i></strong></div>

The Vijaynagar style of architecture was
scattered throughout south India, but the finest
and most characteristic group of buildings is to
be seen in the city of Vijaynagar itself. This city,
in fact, had a great advantage as a site for large
scale building activity in that it abounds in
granite and a dark green chlorite stone, both used
extensively as building material. The use of
monolithic multiple pillars in the temple at
Vijaynagar testify this this fact. The expanse of
the city of Vijaynagar at the height of its glory
measured some 26 sq. km., and it ws enclosed
with a stone wall. Besides palaces and temples,
the city had extensive waterworks and many
secular buildings such elephant stables and the
lotus Mahal.
<br>
<br>
The use of pillars of architectural as well as
decorative purpose is on an unprecedented scale.
Numerous compositions are used in raising the
pillars, but the most striking and also the most
frequent is one in which the shaft becomes a
central core with which is attached an unpraised
animal of a supernatural kind resembling a horse
or a hippograph. Another distinguishing feature
is the use of huge reverse-curve leaves at the
cornice. This feature has been borrowed into the
style from the Deccan and gives the pavilions a
dignified appearance. Pillars form an integral
part of Vijaynagar style, is elaborated into the
volute teminating in an inverted lotus band. The
occurrence of this pendant is an index reliable
of the building in the Vijaynagar group. The
glory of the Vijaynagar empire ended in 1565 at
the battle of Talikota when the combined army
of the Sultans of the Deccan inflicted a crushing
defeat on the Vijaynagar ruler Rama Raya.
