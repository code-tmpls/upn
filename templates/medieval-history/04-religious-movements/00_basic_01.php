<h3>Religious Movements</h3>

Since the dawn of history, India has been the
cradle of religious movements. In the previous
chapters we have religious movements. In the
previous chapters we have discussed the vedic
and Later Vedic (i.e. Upanishadic) ideas to the
emergence of Bhagavatism and other Brahmanic
sects, such as Shaivism, Saktism etc. In the early
medieval period two parralled movements, in
Hinduism and Islam, respectively representing
the Bhakti and Sufi movements emerged in India,
which reached their fullest development in the
fifteenth and sixteent centuries. Both these
religious developments have hardly anything to
do with the coming of Islam or with the so-called
'Muslim rule in India'. The seeds and th Bhakti
movements are to be found in the Upanishads,
Bhagvad Gita, Bhagavata Purana, etc. The
various Sufi saints had come to settle down in
India in the eleventh-twelfth centuries, the
earliest and the most well known being Sheikh
Muinuddin Chisti, who made Ajmer his home
when Prithviraj Chauhan (III) was still ruling
over there. The greatest merit of both these
parallel religious movements is that they freed
the Indian society from the dogmatic beliefs,
ritualism, caste and communal gatred and so on.
It was in the true spirit of Indian history and
culture that both these movements prospered
without even the least ill-will an conflict. On the
contrary, both contributed to each other's
religious ideas and practices. Both these
movements were democratic movements, which
preached simple religion in the language of the
masses and neither craved for political patronage
nor bothered for the political developments
around them.
<br>
<br>
At any rate, one can easily find many
common points in the Bhakti and Sufi
Movements. In both, the elements of
intellectuality went hand in hand with that of
devotion and in both ritualism and
ceremonialism were not as important as the
search of and love for one Supreme Reality. Love
and liberalism were the keynotes of the Sufi and
Bhakti movements. Mystic discipline in both was
canalised towards the moral advancement of the
individual and society by making them rise
above the barriers of colour, creed, wealth, power
and position.
The Indo-Muslim strands gave woven into
the texture of India's national existence a new
design of 'composite culture' by intertwining the
theads of the Bhakti Marg with the Islamic Sufi
(mystic) traditions, the Indian social customs
with the values of man and social ethics reflected
a new ethos. It is not surprising, therefore, to
realize that the composite culture in India
originated in an environment of reconciliation
rather then refutation. cooperation rather than
confromation, co-existance rather than mutual
annihilation.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUFISM</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Origin</i></strong></div>

In the medieval Indian environment Sufism
was the most interesting aspect of Islam. It came
to India before the establishment of the Sultanate
of Delhi but after the foundation of the Turkish
rule, a large Group of Sufis form different Lslamic
countries migrated to India and established
them-selves in many parts of Hindustan. The
early Sufi's traced their ideas to some verses of
the Quran and traditions (Hadith) of the Prophet.
Tothese, however, they gave a mystic
interpretation. Regarding the orgin of the word
"Sufi", numerous explantions have been offered.
According to one view, the Sufi saints wore
garments of coarse wool (suf) as a badge of
poverty and from the word "suf" the name of
term Sufi has been derived. Generally, scholars
trace its origin by the word safa. They say that
those who were pious people were called Sufis.
Abu Nasral Sarraj. the author of an Arabic
treatise on Sufism, derived from suf (wool). Some
scholars have traced its origin to the Greek word
sophia (knowledge).
<br>
<br>
It appears that the first writer to use the word
Sufi is Jahiz of Basar (A.D. 869). According to
jami, the use of the word sufi was first applied
to Abu Hashim of Dufa before A.D. 800.
According to Aul-kusheri this word was
introduced in A.D. 811. Within fifty years it
denoted all the mystics of Iraq, and two centuries
later sufya was applied to the whole body of
msslim mystics.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Sufi Thought</i></strong></div>

Sufism is a common term given to Islamic
mysticism. But it was not organised in a single
sect and its religious doctrines were also not
common; instead they were organised into
various silsilaha of religious doctrines of orders.
They accepted the Prophethood of Mohammad
and the authority of the Quran, but in course of
time they absorbed a variety of ideas and
practices from different sources, such as
Christianity, Neo-Platonism, Zoroastrianism,
Buddhism and Hindu Philosophical systems
(Vedanta and Yoga). Sufism in its advanced
stage was like a "stream which gathers volumes
by joining the tributaries from many lands". For
instance, the concept of a relationship between
God and the Soul as one between the beloved
and the lover was adopted by the Sufis in India.
Pacifism and non-violence, which were imbibed
by the Indian Sufi sains, are also peculiar to
Christianity and Hinduism. Some of the ascetic
practies, involving the starving and torturing of
the body, and ceremonies were also of Indian
origin.
<br>
<br>
The Muslim mystics or the Sufies of the first
two centuries of the Hejira era were asceties, men
of dee preligious feelings, who laid great stress
on the principles of tauba (repentance) and
tawakkul (trust in God). These early mystics of
Islam were fundamentally inspired by the Quraic
conception of a transcendent God. Their
contemplation remained confined within the
limits of the Quran and the prectice of the
prophet.
Sufi mysticism sprang from the doctrine of
Wahadutual wujud of the unity of Being, which
identified the Haq (the createo) and khalq (the
creating). This doctrine means that God is the
unity behind all plurality and the Reality behind
all phenomenal appearances. The Sufis were so
absorbed in this idea that a moment's diversion
form the thought of the Absolute was uberable
to them. In their journey ot cahive union with
the Absolute, they had to pass throuth ten stages
which were: tauba (repentance), wara
(abstinence), Quhd (peity), fagr (poverty), sabr
(patience), shukr (gratitude), Khuf (fear), raja
(hope), tawakkul (conterntment) and riza
(submissioin to the divine will). In passing
through these stages of spiritual development,
the Sufi felt excessive love and yearing for God.
This Sufis had a two-fold objective view, namely,
their own spiritual development and the service
of humanity, Union of the Human soul with
God, through lovin devotion was the essence of
the Sufi faith,
<br>
<br>
The sufis, by their examples, by worda and
conduct, set and ethical standard, They
attempted to bridge the gulf between orthodoxy
and religion of faith and devotions. They spoke
the language of the masses and gave impetus to
linguistic assimilation and to a cultural synthesis.
They played a silent but important part in the
propagation of their faith more by their example
and service, than through any efforts at
importunate persuasion. They imparted Some of
the Sufis were scholars and men of vast eruditon
and acted as teachers. They won the hearts of
the people by their love and liberalism, sincerity
of purpose, charity, piety and social service, They
exercised considerable influence on kings,
officials and nobles for the good of the people.
They shunned wealth and power and dept
themselves aloof from the din and bustle of
worldly life. Through generally liberal and broadminded in outlook, some of the Sufi saints, who
were noted for their piety and learning, were
puritanical in attitude and uncompromising on
questions of strict adherence to the shariat.
Sufism was not to be made a means of
livelihood. They stressed the importance of
earning. Religious literature tells us about many
saintly people who earned their livelihood by
their professional pursuits and recognised the
dignity of labour. Shaikh Ainuddin Qassab
(butcher), a disciple of Hazrat Hamiduddin
Nagori, was a saintly man, he sold meat in Delhi,
Shaikh Abdul Ishaq Gazrioni was a weaver. We
are told that many saintly personages were
farmers and cultivated fields. Shaidh Qasim
Juzri was an agriculturist. Some saints choose
to beg in order to crush their ego. It gave them
peace of mind, which helped them to
concentrate on God. It also made them realise
that everything belinged to god and people were
the custodians. The Sufis did not encourage
celibacy and complete renunciation of the world
for attainment of spiritual personality. Their
moral precepts and ideal love of God did not
mean complete abandonment fo family life. Their
moral precepts and ideal love of God did not
mean complete abandonment of family life,
Excepting a few outstanding saints, the Sufis
were all married and did not shun the life of a
householder. The typical materi alistic approach
was discouraged, but the necessities of life had
ot be worded for. One was not to sit idle after
putting on a loin cloth; but at the same time, one
should not devote all the time for earning one's
bread. The Sufis were broadk-minded people,
who recognised the truth in other faiths. In
extending their help to others they made no
distinction on the basis of caste or creed. The Sufi
saints showed great interest in learning Yoga;
and the Hindu yogis and siddhas frequently
visited the hermitages of the Sufi saints.
The Sufis in India, particularly of the Chisti
and of the Suhrawardi orders, adopted Sama
and Raqs (audition and dancing) as a mode of
invocation to God. They did not sanction any
king of music. Majlis-iSama, which they
sactioned, was totally different from MajlisiTarab of musical entertainment. To the Sufis
music was a means to and end. Sama exhilarated
their spiritual spirit and lifted the veil between
them and God, and helped them in attaining the
superme stage of ecstatic swoon.
The practice of spiritual preceptorship,
known as piri muridi, was also prevalent in
Sufismm. Those who enteried into a particular
fraternity of Sufi saints were called murids
(disciple). The murid had to pledge absolute
submission and devotion to his spiritual guide
called pir.
<br>
<br>
In the eleventh and twelfth ecnturies, Lahoer
an Multan attracted many well-known Sufis
from other countries. The greatest figure in the
history of sufism in India was Khwaja
Muinuddin Chisti who arrived at Lahore form
Ghazni in 1161 and settled down at Ajmer where
he died in 1235-36. He was the founder of the
Chisti order of Sufis in India. To this order
belinged Shakh fariduddin Ganj-i-Shakar (1175-
1265) who is known in the Sikh tradition as Baba
Farid. His mantle fell upon Shaikh Nizamuddin
Auliya (1238-1325). In the thriteenth century the
Suhrawardi order was established in India by
Shaikh Bahauddin Zakariya. The Suhrawardis
though that living in Luxury and activities
participation on political affairs were not
hindrances to spiritual progress. During the
fifteenth century two new Sufi orders- the
Shuttaris and the Qadiris- were founded in India
by Shaikh Abdullag Shattri and Sayyid Ghau
Wala Pir, respective. Thus the Sufis were divided
in silsilahs or orders named after the founder of
each sect and they lived in and maintained the
dhanqahs or hermitages which were vast
complexes.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Sufi Orders (of Silsilas)</i></strong></div>

The Sufis were organised into orders of
silsilahs named after the name or surname of the
founder of the particular order, such as Chisti,
Suhrawardi, Naqshbandi etc. Each Sufi order
had a dhangah or hermitage, where people
Thronged for spiritual solace and guidence from
the Sufi saints. In the sixteenth century there were
as many as fourteen Sufi orders in India, as
mentioned by Abul Fazl. Of the various orders,
largely founded outside India, only two-the
Suhrawardis and the Chistis-were the first to
succeed in establishing themselves firmly on
Indian soil. Two sub-orders, the Firdausi and the
Shuttari offshoots of the Suhrawardi order, were
active in Bihar and Bengal. Sindh and Multan
had become the centres of the spiritual activites
of the saints of the suhrawardi order, The chief
centres of the Chisti silsilah, the most popular
order, were Ajmer, Narnaul, Sarwal, Nagaur,
Hansi, Ayodhya, Badaun and other towns of
U.P. The Chisti order was very popular and it
achieved extraordinary successdue to the liberal
and catholic outlook of many of its sints of
outstanding personality and long period of their
spiritual activity in India. Many of their practices
were akin to those of the Hindus and they, more
than the members of other silsilahs, adapted
themselves to the non-Mulsim environment. It
is one of the eternal glories of the Chisti order
that it produced great spiritual luminaries like
Khawaja Muiniddin Chisti, Khwaja Qutbuddin
Bakhtiyar Kaki, Khqaja Fariduddin Masud Ganji-Shakar, Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya and
Shaikh Nasiruddin Chiragh-i-Dehlvi, Shaikh
Alauk Haq, Shaikh Adhi Seraj and Nur Qutb
Alam of Pandua, Saidh Husamuddin Mnikpuri,
Burhanuddin Gharib and Hazrat Gesu Baraz of
the Deccan.
<br>
<br>
The Sufis, especially of the Chisti and Firduasi
orders, identified themselves with the common
masses, their weal and woe, their grinding
poverty and distress. It was a part of their
discipline to serve the needy and the oppressed.
The saints of the Chisti order regarded money
as carrion, They subsisted on Futuh and Nazur
(unasked for money and persents). Very often
they had to strave. Once, when the wife of Baba
Farid reported that their son was about to die of
starvation, he replied that he was helpless. God
has so decreed and he was dying, Bab Farid wore
wornotu and patched garments, When he died,
there was nothing in this house was demolished
to provide unbaked bricks for his grave. In the
sixteenth century the most notable Chisti saint
was Shaikh Salim Chisti of Fatehpur Sikri who
was a contemporary of Akbar, and the emperor
greatly venerated him.
<br>
<br>
Although Abul-Fazl in Ain-i-Abbari
mentions 14 Sufi silsilas as active in India by the
16th century, the fact remains that in terms of
their following and better-organisation, only six
silsilas should be recognised as active and
fifluential. Of these, the Chistiyay, founded in
India by Khwaja Muin-un-din Chisti (popularly
known as Khwaja Ajmeri) (though begun by
Khwaja Abdul Chisti-d. 966 - in Iran) attracted
the largest of devotees, both Muslims and
Hindus, and also made a profound impact on
the course of the new Bhakti movement among
the Hindus that, gained momentum in the 14th
century, and sperad out to many parts of the
country in the next three hundred years.
Prominent Sufi Saints
The only other silsila active in the Sultanate
period (1206-1526) was the Suhrawardia, with
its headquarter in Multan and later extending
to Sindh, which was established in India by
Sheikh Bahauddin Zakaria (d. 1192). Then came
the Firdausi silsila, mainly restriced to Bihar, that
was spread by the prolific wirter of mystic
literature Shaikh Sharfuddin Yahua Muniri
around the 13th century, followed by the
Qadiriya and the Shuttarria silsila in the middle
of the 15 the century.
<br>
<br>
Yet he had a great fondness for Amir
Dhusrau, the mystically inclined aristocrat and
a versatile genius, who used to send his days with
the sultans and nights of devotion at the
Khanqah of Nizamuddin Aulia. It is in his poems
and ordres, sung over the centuries by the
quwwals (religious singers), that saint
Nizamuddin figures prominently.
Shaikh Nizamuddin's liberal and tolerant
outlook, offended the orthodox clergy but helped
the spread of his message throughout the country
and gained for him the popular title, Mahboodi-Illahi (the belived of the God). His tomb in Delhi,
built by Sutan Muhammud-bin-Tughlak, (despite
the Sints wish: "I want no monument over my
grave: Let me rest in board and open plain") This
remains even after six and a half centuries an
constant place of Pilgrimage, and massive
congregation of people of all castes and creeds,
Hindus and Muslims.
<br>
<br>
Shaikh Nizamuddin Aulia's successord
spread through the country, one to Hansi,
another to Gulbarga, a third in Bengal,l and two
remained in Delhi, of whom Shaidh Nasiruddin
Muhamud (d.1356), who was later known as
Chirag-i-Delhi (the lamp of Delhi) was a
charismatic saint, whose 100 'conversation' (as
reported in Dhairul Majalis) reflected melancholy
at the state of affairs in social and economic life,
caused by political upheavals, bad
administration, price rise and general anarchy,
With the death of Chirag-i-Delhi, the first
phase of Chisti silsila ends. One of his successor
was syed muhammad Gesu Daraz was a prolific
writer of over thirty books on Tasawwuf
(mysticism). His love for the poor and the needy
and his defence of the rights of man earned him
the title of Bandanawaz (benefactor of God's
creatures).
He was one of the early poets and writers in
the Urdu language- a new language that had
grown as a synthesis of persian, Turkish and
Arabic on the one hand and of the Indian dialects
Khari Boli Braj and Punjabi on the other, with
its base in Sanskrit syntax and etymology drawn
from many sources. His famous couplet, that
reflected the credo of the mysticism and bhakti,
was one of the first specimens of Urdu Poetry,
His one of the famous couplets is: "infidelity is
welcome to the infidels and Islam to the Shaikh.
But to us lovers, love and the content and
harmony of our hearts is enough."
The Qadriya silsila was established in Indian
by Shaba Nayamatullag Qadiri, and the the
Shattaria silsila by Shah Abdullag Shuttari (d.
1458). The former spread mainly in Madhya
Pradesh and Gujrat regions. In the reign of Akbar
(1556-1605), the last of six major silsilas, the
Naqshbandiah was established by Khwaja Baqi
Ballah (1563-1603) and its most famous aint was
Shaikh Ahmed Sirhindi (d.1625) Known as
Mujeddid Alif Sani (The Reformer of the 10th
century).
<br>
<br>
Prince Dara Shikoh, the eldest son of Shah
Jahan, become the follower of the Qadiri order
and visited Mian Mir (1550-1635) at Lahore,
When Mian Mir died, Dara become a disciple of
his successor named Mullah Shah Badakhshi.
Shaikh Ahmed Sarihindi, a contemporary of
Akbar and Jahangir, was a great Sufi saint of
the Naqshbandi order. He attacked the Mystic
Philosophy of the Unity of Being (wahadat-ulwujud) and rejected it. In its place he expounded
the philosophy of Apparentism (Wahadat-ulshud). He said that the relationship between man
and God is that of a slave and the master, and
not that of a lover and the believed, as the Sufis
generally believed. In short, Shaikh Ahmad's
object was to harmonise the doctrine of
mysticism with the teachings of orthodox Islam,
and that is why he is known as Mujaddid, i.e.
the renovator of Islam.
Medieval Indian traditons remember Prince
Dara Shikoh not so much as a Mughal Prince,
but as a mystic philosoper, In his Persian work,
Majmaul Bahrian, there are interesting
discussion on the Sufi and Hindu cosmologies.
The great dream of his life was th brotherhook
of all faiths and unity of mankind. One of his
great devottes esa Sarmsad, who was executed
during the reign of Aurangzeb for the Livberality
of his religious views.
In the 17th Century Sufism shattered the
chains of sectarian beliefs and preached the unity
of mandin. Such Sufi sanits were known as Yari
Saheb, who flourished about A.D. 1668-1725,
was free from all sectarianism. He says that the
eyes should be painted with the dust of the guru's
feet as with collyrium. His peoms, in which the
name of Allah is mentioned along with the of
Rama and Hari, are full of abstruse metaphysical
turths, He says, 'This creation is a painting of
the Creator on the canvas of void ehth the brush
of love. He who has not experienced this joy
through love will never know it through
reasoning. Men and women are, as bubbles in
the ocean of divine live'.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sufi Saints of Sindh:</b> Sindh was also a great
Centre of neo-sufism and a number of Sufi saints
flourished there. Any account of the mystics of
Sind must begin with Shah Karim, who lived
about A.D. 1600. He received his first religious
inspiration from a Vaishnava saint near
Ahmedabad, who initiated him into the
mysteries of Om. This symbol served as a beaconlight to him.
The next mystic worthy of mention is Shah
Inayat, a universally respected figure. When the
Hindus of Sind, under the oppression of the
Kalhora kings, were fleeing in number to save
their life and faith, it was he who sheltered many
such fugitive families in his own hermitage. His
faith, that God is not the property of any
particular sect finally led to his execution.
But it is Shah Latif who holds the highest
place among the mystics of Sindh. He was the
greatest poet and singer of the province, and his
songs are sung by people even now.
It was not unusual to find in Sindh a Hindu
as the guru of the Muslims, or a Muslim as the
grur of the Hindus. The songs of the Sufi mystic
poets Dedil and. Bekas are still widely sung by
Sindhi men and women. The real name of Bedas
was Mohammed Husain, he died at the age of
twenty-two, but has lift a deep impression on
the religious life of Sind. The poets Rohal and
Qutub also belong to the same fraternity, and
gave left behind them songs, that are as sweet
as they are profound. At their shrines both
Hindus and Muslim used to congregate and keep
all night vigils, singing religious songs.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bulle Shah:</b> No account on neo-Sufism
would be complete without a reference to Bulle
Shah.
<br>
Bulle shah was probably born in A.D. 1703,
in a Sayyuid family in the city of Constantinople
(Istanbul), and at a very young age he walked
all the way to Punjab hankering for spiritual
truth, In the Indian mode of religious practice,
he found precisely what he was seeking, and
settled down to a life of meditation and worship
at Kasur, He was a fierice critic of the Quran
and all other scriptures, and neither the Hindu
nor the Muslim theologians could excel him in
debates. He was buried also at Kasur, and the
plece attractts numerous pilgrims and holy men.
Bulle Shah says: 'You will find god neither
in the mosque nor in the Ka'aba, neither in the
Quran and other holy books nor in formal
prayers. Bulla, you will not find salvation either
in Mecca or in the Ganga; 'you will find it only
when you lay down your ego'.
'I found the highest peace and joy when I
discovered Allah within my own heart: through
death I have reached the life eternal; I am ever
journeying forward.'
'O Bulla, intoxicate thyself with the wine of
divine love, Men will slander you and call you
by a hundred names; when they abuse you with
the name of kafir, say, "yes, friend, you are right".


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Hindu Impact on Sufism</i></strong></div>

According to Alberuni, the Sufi theories of
the soul are similar to those in Patanjali's Yoga
Sutra. Like the Youga Sutar, Sufi works also
stated that 'the bodies are the source of the souls
for the purpose for acquiring recompense'.
Albeurni also identifies the Sufi doctrine fo divine
loves as self-annihilation with parallel passages
from the Bhagavad Gita.
By the thirteenth century, the Indian Sufis
were confronted with the Kanphata (splitearned) yogis or the Nath followers of
Gorakhnath. Sheikh Nizamuddin Auliya's
description of the human body into regions of
Siva and Sakti. The area from the head to the
navel. associated with Siva, was spiritual; the
area below the naval. associated with Sakti, was
profane. Shaikh Nizamuddin Auliya was also
impressed with the yogic theory that a child's
moral character was determined by the day of
the month on which he was conceived.
The Hatha yogic treatise Amritakunda,
which had been translated into Arabic and
Persian in the thritheenth century, had a lasting
effect on Sufism. Shaikh Nasiruddin Chiragh-iDehlve observed that controlled greathing is the
essence of Sufism. Controlled greathing is
initially a deliberate action but later becomes
automatic. He urged practising articulated
breathing lide the perfect yogis, known as
siddhas. Yogic postures and breath control
become an integral part of Chistiya Sufic practice,
and controlled breathing was incomporated
finally as a vital aspect in all the Sufi orders
except the Indian Naqshbandiyyas.
The Sufi theory of wahadat-ul-wujud and
Sufi analogies for it were remarkably similar to
those of the yogis. Sheikh Hamiduddin Nagori's
Hindi verses reflect that yogic influence. The
Nath doctrines had fo-reaching influence on the
Chishtiya Sheikh Abdul Quddus Gangohi
(d.1537). His Rushadnama contains Hindi verses
composed by him and his spiritual guides are
designed to support the truth of the wahadatul-wujud doctrine, The imperceptible Lord
(Alakh Niranjana), he says, is invisible, but those
who are able to perceive Him, are lost to
themselves, In another verse, the shaikh identifies
Alakh Niranjana with God (Khuda). References
to the yogi saint Gorakhanath in the
Rushadanama equate him with Ultimate Reality
of Ablsolute Truth. some references to those
names imply 'perfect man' or 'perfect siddha'.
The union of sakti-the sun- and Siva-the moonis. according to the Shaikh, symbolised by prayers
performed hanging upside down with the legs
suspended from a roof or the branch of a tree,
Here we find very clear evidence of the practices
of Hindus tantirism influenceing Sufi beliefs.
The cross-fertilisation of Sufi beliefs with
those expressed by the Kashmiri Shaivite woman
yogi Lalla of Lal Ded (Lall Yogesveri) is reflected
in the Fishi movement of Shaikh Nuruddin Rishi
(d. 1439) of kashmir. The Shaikh's teachings are
embodied in his Kashmiri verses, some of which
are almost identical with those composed by Lal.
Through them the shaikh emerges as an ardent
devotee of God trying of reach the Unknowable
in the reart by lighting the lamp of love.
Nuruddin and his disciples preferred to call
themselves rishis, using the well known term for
the Hindu sages. Their main theme was
universal love. They served the people without
considering caste and tried to turn Kashmir into
a geaven for the neglected sections fo society.
Shaikh Nuruddin believed that, although eating
meat was permitted by the shariat, it entailed
cruelty to animals, and he exhorted people to
become a vegatarian.
<br>
<br>
The Nath ideas found great popularity in
fifteenth-century Bengal. The Amritakunda, a
text on Hatha yoga, was first translated into
Arabic in Bengal in the early thirteenth century.
Sayyid Murataza (d.1662) later write the YogaQulandar, identifying the Qalandriyya discipline
of Abu Ali Qalandar with yoga practices. Sayyid
Sulatan (d. 1668) of Chittagong also composed
a number of bengali works on Muslim themes of
union with God, with Hindus and yogic
overtones. The Haqaiq-i-Hindi by Abul Wahik
(d. 1608) of Bilgram (near Lucknow) was
intended to crush orthodox opposition to ghe use
of vaishnavite themes in Hindi poetry recited by
the Chishtiyya Sufies to arouse ecstasy. To Gesu
Daraz, Hindi poetry was more subtle and elegant
and transported the Sufies to higher planes of
mystical ecstasy than Persian verses did.
The sixteenth century saw a tremendous
increase in the volume of Hindi poetry. Naturally
its recitation at Sufi gathering required some
definec. Mir Abul wahid sought to justify this
practice by giving Islamic equivalents for features
of the Drishna legend such as Drishna, Radha,
Gopi, Braj, Goku, Yamuna, Gang, Mathura, and
the flute in his Haqaiq-i-Hindi. He pleads that
this identification renders unobjectionable the
transpot of Sufi into ecstasy on hearing Hindu
Vaishnative poetry. The translation of Sanskrit
works into Persian at Akbar's court had made
Muslims aware of the Vedanta School of Hindu
philosophy. Jahangir identified the highest form
of Sufism with vedanta.
<br>
<br>
The Sufi saints preached in the language of
the masses and made immense contribution to
the development of Hindi and provinicial
languages including Bengali, punjabi, Kashmiri,
etc. The Sufis, despite their strict adherence to
the laws of the shariat and practices of
orthodoxy, instead of criticising the religion,
mythology and folklore of the Hindus, were
broad-minded enough to study them in their
Hindi verses. Some went to the extent of quoting
verses from Hindi poems while delivering
delivering religious sermons from the pulpits.
Badauni tells us that Makhdum Shaikh
Taqiuddin Waiz Rabbani used to read
occasionally verses form Chandian of Mulla
Daud relating to the love of Lorik, and Chanda,
Once when a certain person asked the Shaikh
the reason of choosing to recite Hindi verses in
his religious sermons, the saint replied that the
whole thing is full of divine and pleasing subject,
Malik Muhammad jayasi, though an orthodox
Muslim, was also a good Sufi and that has
mentioned Hindu gods and goddesses and has
shown his familarity with Vedanta, Yoga and
Nath cults. The Muslim author of the Mrigavati
and Madhumalati, of Manasat, and other Hindi
poems had already paved the way for Jayasi,
The Sufi poet Qutban not only write in the
language of the people of the locality, but was
also fully conversant with Hindu mythology, He
had neither contempt nor prejudice for the
Hindu Scriptures and mythology.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BHAKTI MOVEMENT</i></strong></div>

The Bhakti movement is much older than the
Sufi movements. It philosophical concept had
been fully enunciated in the Upanishads and
subsequently, the Bhagavad Gita emphasised
love and devotion as pathways to God. In the
sixth century A.D. The Bhagavata purana placed
the concept of bhakti on a very high pedestal.
During the post-Bhagavata phase passionate
love and devotion to one personal god become a
characteristic feature of the Indian religious
thought.
<br>
<br>
But the concept of bhakti was placed on a
firmer ground in South India, when
Shankaracharya revived the philosophy of
Advaita or Vedanta. After Shankara, twelve
Tamil Vaishnava saints collectively known as
Alvars made the concept of bhakti more popular.
The Alvars were followed by the
Vaishnavaacharyas who gave the Bhakti cult a
metaphysical foundation. According to this
school of thought the 'Supreme Being' is not
'attributeless' but saguna, possissing qualities of
goodness and beauty to an infinite degree, The
early leadera of the Bhakti movement to North
India and is rightly regarded as a bridge between
the bhakti movement of Suth and North India.
Features of Bhakti movement

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The concept of Bhakti means singleminded devotion to one God. The object
of the devotee's adoration is to secure
the grace of God for the sake of
aslvation.</li>
        <li>The Bhakti cult discarded the rituals and
sacrifices as modes of worship and
instend emphasis ed the purity of reart
and mind, humanism and devation as
the simple way to realisation of God.</li>
        <li>The Bhakti movement was essentially
monotheistic and the devotees
worshipped one personal God, who
could either have form (saguna) or be
formless (nirguna). The followers of the
former, knowh as vaishhavas, were
futher subdivided into of Krishna - both
incarnations of Vishnu - as their
personal God, respectively. The followers
of Nirguna Bhakti discarded idol
worship. They said that, God is
omnipresent and resides within the
heart of man.</li>
        <li>On the philosophical side, the Saguna
and Nirguna both believed in the
Upanishadic philosophy of advaita,
with minor variation suggested by
various Bhakti saints.</li>
        <li>The Bhakti saints of North as well as
South India regarded knowledge (jana)
as a consitituent of bhakti. Since, that
knowledge could be gained through a
teacher of guru, the Bhakti movement
greatly emphasised securing true
knowledge form a guru.</li>
        <li>The Bhakti movement was an egalitarian
movement, which completely discard
the disciminations based on caste of
creed. The saints of the Bhakti
movement were staunch wupporters of
social unity and purity of mind,
character and soul. The doors of Bhakti
were opened for the lowest classes and
even untouchables. Many of the saits of
the Bhakti movement were from the
lower classes.</li>
        <li>The Bhakti movement also discarded the
priestly domination as well as rituals.
According to the Bhakti saints, the
individual could realise God through
devotion and personal effort. Therefore,
there was no place for sacrifices and
daily rituals in the Bhakti movement.</li>
        <li>The Bhakti saints preached in the simple
language of the masses and, therefore,
immensely contributed to the
development of modern Indian
languages, such as Hindi, Marathi,
Bengali and Gujarati.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


It can thus be seen that the Bhakti cult was a
widespread movement that the Bhakti cult was
a widespread movement that embrached the
whole of the subcontinent of India for several
centuries. It was a movement of the people and
aroused intense interest among them. Perhaps
after the decline of Buddhism there had never
been a more widespread and popular movement
in our country than the Bhakti movement.
Although its basic principles of love and devotion
to a personal God were purely Hindu and the
principles of unity of Godhead on which its
teaching rested were also mainly Hindu. The
movement was profoundly influenced by Islamic
belief and practices. The Bhakti movement had
two main objects in view. One was to reform
the Hindu religion so as to enable it to withstand
the onslaught of Islamic propaganda and
proselytism. Its second object was to bring about
a compromise between Hinduism and Islam and
to foster friendly relations between Hindu and
Muslim communities. It succeeded in realising,
to a great extent, the first object of bringing about
the simplification of worship and liberalising the
traditional caste rules. "The high and the low
among the Hindu public forgot many of their
projedices and believed in the message of the
reformers of the Bhakti cult, that all people were
equal in the eyes of God and that birth was no
bar to religious salvation".


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bhakti Saints and Reformers</i></strong></div>

The cult of bhakti was followed by a host of
saints of northern India. The moving spirit were
Ramananda, Kabir, Nanak, chaitanya and
others. The leaders of the Bhakti movement of
the early period were mostly of southern
extractions. The Bhakti movement associated
with the southern group was more scholasitc
than popular, which was not the case with the
northern group. The bhaktas of the latter group
did not ponder over the subtle questions of
metaphysics. The were essentially eclectic, broadminede and latitudinarian in their views and
outlook. Caste was not a factor in the new Bhakti
movement. Many of the Bhakti poets rose form
lower castes. Their message was both for the rich
and the poor, the high caste and the low, the
educated and the illiterate.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ramanuja (twelfth century):</b> The earliest
exponent of the Bhakti movement was the great
Vaishnava teacher Ramanuja who flourished in
the early years of the twelfth century in the
South. His ideas laid the foundation of a vigorous
popular movement for the uplift of the people.
The next leader of the Bhakti movement was
Nimarbaka, a contemporary of Ramanuja. He
believed in the philosophy of Vishistadvaita and
laid emphasis on surrender to God.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ramananda (fifteenth century):</b>
Ramananda, who flourished in the first half of
the fifteenth century, was the first great Bhakti
saint of North India. He opened the door of
bhakti ot all without any distinction of birth,
caste, creed or sex. He was a worshipper of Rama
and believed in two great principles, namely, (a)
perfectlove for God and (b) human brotherhood.
Ramananda adopted Hindi as the medium of
his discourses and his message directly reached
the common people. In his teachings the caste
rigours were greatly softened and even Shudras
were considered equal in the eyes of God
Ramananda did away with the insular social
behaviours of the Hindus by throwing his
spiritual door wide open for members of all
castes. Religion now become a question of faith,
emotion an devotion. As a result of his teaching,
a member of the despised classes could reach his
God without an intermediary.
<br>
<br>
His unique contribution to Indian spiritual
life was the spirit of synthesis obseved in his
teaching. He accepted all that was true and of
permanent value in our spiritual heritage- the
philosophy of meditation (yoga and knowledge
from the North and the absolute surrender
(prapatti) of the Bhakti cult from the South - and
rejected all that was untrue, ephemeral, or rigidly
sectarian. There is a popular verse to this effect:
'Bhakti arose forst in the Dravida land;
Ramananada brought it to the North; and Kabir
spread it to the seven continents and nine
divisions of the world.'
Ramananda borrowed ideas from virious
religious schools, vitalized them with the love
and devotion of his heart, and founded a new
path of spiritual realization. we do not come
across many of his saying, but the radiant
personality of his disciples- the men he createdconstituted his living message. His one song is
incorporated in the Granth Sahib.
Though Ramananda used the popular name
of Rama, his God was the one God of love and
mercy, without any imperfection-not the eternal
Brahman of the Vedanta, but the beloved, the
friend, and the lord of one's heart. When
Ramananda perceived that there is only one God
who is the origin of all, all the distinctions of caste
and creed vanished for him, and he saw
humanity as one large family, and all men as
brothers. One man is higher than another, not
through his birth, but only through his love and
sympathy. So he started preaching to all without
any reserve, and his fundamental teaching was
the gospel of love and devotion. He also gave up
the use of Sanskrit and started preaching in the
language of the people, thus laying the
foundation of modern vernacular literatures.
It is said that his first twelve followers were:
Ravidasa the cobbler, Kabir the weaver,
Bhanna the jat peasant, Sena the barber, Pipa
the Rajput, bhvananda, Sudhanda,
Surasurananda, Parmananda, Mahananda, and
Sri Ananda. But some of them were not
personally initiated by him; they were drawn to
his ideas long after his demise.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ravidasa (Raidas):</b> (Fifteenth Century) He
was one of the most famous disciples of
Ramananada. He was a cobbler by birth, but his
religious life was as exalted and pure as it was
deep. There are over thirty hymns of Ravidasa
collected in the Granth Sahib of the Sikha. Kabir
also has expressed more than once his deep
reverence for him. Ravidasa was the worshipper
of the one infinite God, who is above and beyond
all religious sects and without beginning or end.
He preached that the Lord resides eithin the
rearts of his devotees, and cannot be accessed
through the performance of amy rites and
ceremonies. Only one who has felt the pangs of
divine love will find Him, and the highest
expression of religion in life is the service of man,
<br>
<br>
<b>Kabir (1440-1510):</b> Kabir, the most radical
disciple of Ramananda, gave a positive shape to
the social philosophy of his illustrious teacher,
In his trenchant arguments against the barrier
of castes. Ramananda prepared the way for
Kabir. The later made a sincere attempt at a
religious and national synthesis out of conflicting
creeds. Kabir was neither a theologian nor a
philosopher. he appears before us as teacher. he
had the courage ot condemn what he considered
to be sham and counterfeit in both Hinduism and
Islam.
<br>
The central theme of Kabir's teaching is
bhakti "kabir refused to acknowledge caste
distinction or to recognise the authority of the
six school of Hindu philosophy, or the four
divisions of life prescribed by the Brahmans. He
held that religion without bhakti was no religion
at all. and that asceticism, fasting and almsgiving had no value if unaccompanied by bhajan
(devotional worship)". By means of ramaini,
sakhas and sakhis he imparted religious
instruction to Hindus and Muslims alike, He had
no perference for either religion. He thought
aloud and never made it his object merely ot
please his hearers. He thoroughly scrutinised the
bases of ritualism. he incessantly fought to
remove the fitualistic wuperstitions like visiting
places of pilgrimage.
Kabir was a great satirist and ridiculed all
the institutions of his time. He opposed the
Popular belief in the institution of sati. He was
equally against the veiling of women. Kabir
refused to recognise the superiority of Brahmins
as a class. He refused to believe that birth in a
particular caste was due to the deeds in a
previous life. He advocated perfect equality of
Shudras and Brahmins. Both Shudras and
Brahmins were born in the same way, he said.
Kabir provides us with a code of ethics. he
condemned pride and selfishness and advocated
the cultivation of the quality of humility. Kabir
was a spokesmen for the poor and downtrodden
section of society. He condemned the sense of
humility and simplicity of the poor as well as
the vanity and pride of the rich; By such
condemnations; Kabir preached the common
brotherhood of man and sought to remove the
distinction between Hindus and the Musilms.
Though he led a religious life, Kabir married,
and it is said that the name of his wife was Loi.
His son Kamal was both a thinker and a devotee.
when, after his father's name, he answered, "My
father had striven throughout his life aganist all
forms of sectarianisn; how can I, his son, destroy
his ideal and thereby commit his spiritual
murder?" This remark estranged many of Kabir's
disciples from Kamal.
After Kabir's death, his Muslim disciples
organized themselves in Maghar, where they
founded a monastery; hindu disciples were
organized into an order by Surat Gopala, with
their centre in Varanasi.
The chief scripture of this sect is the wellknown Bijak a compilation of Kabir's couplets.
In course of time, this centre leaned more and
more towards Vedantic doctrines.
Kabir believed in a simple and natural life,
He himself wove cloth and sold it in the market
like any ordinary weaver. He did not interpret
religious life as a life of idleness; he held that all
should toil and earn and help each other, but
none should hoard money. There is no fear of
corruption form wealth, if it is dept constantly
in circulation in the service of humanity.
Kabir tried to express simple thoughts of a
simple hearts in the common language of the
people. He said, 'O Kabir, Sahskrit is the water
in a well. the language of the people is the
flowing stream'. His simple words had infinite
power.
<br>
<br>
<b>Malukdasa (1574-1682):</b> One of the many
followers of Kabir, he was born towards the end
of the sixteenth century in the District of
Allahabad. He was kind and compassionate,
and, though religious man, he lived the life of a
house holder. The monasteries of his sect are
found all over North India and even beyond,
from Bihar to Kabul. he too preached against
the worship of images and other external forms
of religion, and his followers rely entirely on the
grace of God for their salvation. He was against
mortification of the flesh, and taught that the
true path of spirituality lay in the simple devotion
of the heart.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dadu (1544-1603) :</b> The most famous of the
followers of Kabir's ideals was Dadu, he was
born of Brahmana parents in Ahmedabad in
A.D. 1544 and died in 1603 in the village of
Narana of Narayana in Rajasthan, where his
followers (Dadu-panthis) have now their chief
centre. The great dream of his life was to unite
all the divergent faiths in one bond of love and
comradeship, and he founded the
Brahmasampradaya or Parabrahmasampradaya to give effect to this great ideal. His
sayings possess great depth and liberality and
show clear traces of the influence of Kabir.
Dadu believed not in the authority of
scriptures, but in the value of self-realization. To
attain this realization, we must divest ourselves
of all sense of the ego and surrender our lives
entirely to God. All men and women are as
brothers and sister in the presence of God. He
resides within the hearts of men, and it is there
that we must meditate on Him. Union with God
is possible only through love and devotion, and
it is deepened not by prayers, but by joining our
service to His service of the universe. We are
united with God when, shedding all sins and
impurities, we sincerely surrender ourselves to
the divine will.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dadu taught :</b> 'Be humble and free from
egotism; be compassionate and devoted in
service; be a hero, fearless and energetic; free your
mind from sectarianism, and from all the
meaningless forgiving by nature and firm in your
faith. The path of realization becomes easier, if
you can find a true teacher.'
He himself was very simple by nature and
firm in your faith, and his prayers were full of
depth and sweetness. he was a householder, and
he believed that, the natural life of a householder
was best suited for spiritual realization.
At the request of Dadu, his disciples made a
collection of the devotional writings of all the
different sects, calculated to help men in their
striving towards god, such an anthology of the
religious literature of different sects was perhaps
the first of its kind in the world, for the Granth
Sahib was first compiled in A.D. 1604, while this
anthology was completed some years befor A.D.
1600. This collection includes many sayings of
Muslim saints like Kazi Kadam, Shaikh Farid,
Kazi Mohommed, Shaikh Bahawad, and
Bakhna.
<br>
<br>
Among the many disciples of Dadu,
Sundaradasa (A.D. 1597-1689), Rajjab, and
other were distinguished personalities. Dadu
persuaded his disciples to render into simple
Hindu from Sanskrit the abstruse philosophical
truths. He also made it a practice among them
the writer in Hindi, prose and verse, Dadu
admitted both Hindus and Muslims to his
discipleship, and there have been many gurus
in his sect who came form the Muslim families.
Even today, in Rajjab's branch of Dadu's sect,
andy one who attains to the height of spiritual
realization is accepted as the head of the order,
whether he be a Hindu or a Muslim. The songs
and prayers of Rajjab are universal in appeal and
superb for their spirit of devotion.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rajjab says:</b> ' There are as many sects as there
are men; thus has come into being the diversity
of spiritual endeavour. The sacred stream of the
Ganga rises from the blessed feet of Narayana,
but the feet of the Lord are in the hearts of the
devotees. Thus, from the heart of every devotee
flows a Ganga of thoughts. If I can unite all the
streams of thoughts in this world, such a
confluence would indeed be the holiest of places.'
He Further said: ' This universe is the veda, the
creation is the Qur'an.'
<br>
<br>
<b>Guru Nanak (1469-1538):</b> The Bhakti
movement in northern India, which had been
gathering strength ever since the time of
Ramanda, got another ardent bhakta in Guru
Nanak. He was preceded by an evolution of ideas
and he followed the path blaxed by his illustrious
predecessors. He founded a new religion which
has survived as a permanent element in the
Indian society.
<br>
<br>
Guru Nanak, sharing to the full the eclectic
spirit of his time, sought for a creed capable of
expressing Hindus and Muslim devotion alike.
He use both Hindu and Muslim nomenclatures
for God, rama, Govinda, Hari, Murari, bad and
Rahim. He wanted to domlish the wall that stood
in the way of the two communities and unite
them.
The social teaching of Guru Nanak were
basically a reaffirmation of the ethical ideas
common to the medieval monotheistic religious
doctrine of human equality. He held that it was
sheer folly to think in terms of caste, A man was
to be honoured for his devotion to God and not
for his social position. he says. "God knows man's
virtues and inquires not his caste; in the next
world there is no caste." Guru Nanak started free
community kitchens called Guru ka longer. His
followers. Guru Nanak did not believe in the
doctrine of chhut (theological contamination)
which had compartmentalised society.
He conceived of God as nirakara (formless).
He discarded the worship of images and
repudiated idolatry. Being a man of deep and
strong conviction. he defined explicitly the ethics,
norms and usages of public life, he resented the
survival of superstition which seemed to be a
mark of cultural backwardness. He educated
people to distinguish superstitions form religious
values. The superstitions and formalism of both
Hindustan and Islam were condemned.
Unlike Kabir, Nanak was a well-educated
ma. He had studied Persian and Hindi, besides
his mother-tongue Punjabi. he travelled all over
India and also to some countries of Central Asia
including Arabia, and come in contant with men
of diverse professions, pursuits and creeds. He
wrote inspiring poems and songs which were
collected in a book form subsequently published
as the Adi Grantha. He was recognised as a
Guru, and died at Krtarpur in 1528.
Nanak was a revolutionary religious
reformer, he proclaimed that there is no
distinction between man and man, all were born
equal in the eyes of God. He felt that the real
cause of the misery of the people was their
disunity born of diversity of belief. He considered
education essential for the attainment of true and
complete life, True education helps the soul to
unfold itself like a lotus of countless petals.
The universalism of his message and
reasonableness of his precepts brought about a
moral renaissance in India. He preached to the
high and the high and the low without any
distinction of caste, creed or colour.
<br>
<br>
Guru Nanak was a monist and his
monotheism, unlike that of some other bhaktas.
was undiluted. He did not believe in the
incarnation of God. he regarded himself as the
prophet of God who had come for the divine
Court. He taught that there is one God in the
world and the no other and that Nanak, the
caliph (son) of God, speaks truth. Nanak looks
upon God as one Lord and the commander of
all. The universe is His domain and from His
brilliance everything is brilliant. All is illumined
by the light of His apperance.
Nanak says that devotion cannot exist
without virtue. Truth is no doubt great but
greater is truthful living. The qualities which one
should cultivate assiduously are humility,
charity, forgiveness and sweet words.
Remembrance of god is the primary duty of a
seeder of truth remember the name of God and
give up everything else, Simran is the practice of
devotion to God. He (God) is high and worthy
of worship. God is not outside but within every
individual. He that pervades the universe also
dwells in the body. Speak the truth, then you
would realise God within you. Nanak believed
in God as the omnipotent reality, but maintained
that the separate individuality of the human soul
could attain union with him through love and
devotion.
<br>
<br>
Nanak's mission was to reform the Hindus
religion on the basis of unity of the Godhead and
to bring about friendly realation between the
Hindus and Muslims.
<br>
<b>Chaitanya (1486-1533):</b> Perhaps the greatest
saint if not the greatest leader, of the Bhakti
movement was Chaitanya There had been
Vaishnavism in Bengal long before his birth. But
the activities of Chaitanya who is the founder of
modern Vaishanvism in Bengal gave a great
inpetus to Vaishhavism and made it popular all
over Bengal and Orissa. Chaitanya's original
name was Vishwambhar and he was born at
Navadwip in February 1486. The boy was given
the name of Nimai. His father Jagannath Mishra
was a religious and scholarly man and his mother
Shachi too was deeply religious and pious.
Vishwambhar was sent to a private school to
learn and afterwards entrusted to a well-known
Pandit, Ganga Das, for higher studies. He was
an exceptionally brilliant student and is said to
have mastered the Sanskrit language and
literature, grammar and logic, at the early age
of fifteen, Shortly after he completed his
education, he was give the title of Vidyasagar
(the ocean ; of learning). While he was a student,
his father died. He was married to a girl named
Lakshmi but she died of shake-bite. He married
again and this lady survived her husband's
sanyas and death. He was not yet 22 when he
received diksha (initation) from a saintly man,
named Ishwar Prui, Whom he met at Gaya
during a pilgrimage. The motive which
influenced him to adopt asceticism was probably
diverse and complex; at best, it is left obscure.
Chaitanya settled permanently at puri where he
died.
<br>
<br>
After sanyas he felt himself free from all
worldly bounds and his heightened emotions
and ecstasies become marked. He said, "I shall
wander form house to house giving the holy
name of God to all. The Chandals, lowest caste,
women and children all will stand with wonder
and love to hear his name. Even boys and girls
will sing his praise." Chaitanya loved God as no
man before or after him ever loved. he preached
the religion of intense faith in one Supreme Being
whom he called Drishna or Hari. He was free
from ritualism, and his wordhip consisted in love
and devotion, song and dance, so intense and
full of emotion that devotees felt God's Presence
in a state of ecstasy.
<br>
<br>
He was a great exponent of Krishnite form
of Vaishnavism. He adored Krishna and Radha
and attempted to spiritualies their lives in
Vrindaban, he preached to all irrespective of
caste and creed. His influence was so profound
and lasting that he is considered by his followers
as an incarnation of Krishna of Vishnu.
Chaitanya accepted that Krishna along is the
most perfect God. Vaishnavism, as preached by
Chaitanya, created an unprecedented sensation
and enthusiasm in Gengal and its neighbouring
religions. like Orissa and Assam. Although
Chaitanya had many followers, he did not seem
to have directly organised them into a sect of
cult. It was his followers and devoted disciples,
who after the master's death, systematised his
teachings and organised themselves into a sect
called Gaudiya Vaishnavism.
<br>
<br>
<b>Mirabai (1498-1546):</b> Mirabai was one of the
greatest saints of sixteenth century India. She was
the only child of Ratna Singh Rathor of Merta.
She was born at the village of Kudvi in Merta
district in or about A.D. 1498 and was married
to Rana Singa's eldest son and heir-apparent
Bhoraj in 1516. She was highly religious from
her childhood, and like her father and grandfather, was a follower of the Krishna cult of Vaishnavism. After her husband's death she devoted
herself entirely to religious pursuits. Her fame
as a sincere devotee of Krishna dnd a patron of
men of religion speread far and wide and drew
hermits of both sexes from distant places to Chittor. Owing to the strained relations with the rulers of Mewar, she went to reside with her uncle
Biram Deva who was the chief of Merta. And
there too she continued her daily routine. She
remained engrossed in spiritual meditation and
in religious music and dance. She also continued having kirtan in the company of other religious men and women. In this way she spend
years at Merta; but when that city was invaded
and captured by Maldeva of Jodhpur; she decided to undertake pilgrimage to Dwarka. There
she lived the life of a dovotee and died in 1546.
Mira is said to have composed numerous
poems, all of them being devotional songs. Her
lyrics, however, are her chief title to fame. They
are written in Brijbhasha and partly in
Rajasthani, and some of her verses are in
Gujarati. These lyrics are saturated with super
abundant feeling of love and devotion and are
so melodious that they instantaneously arouse
the tenderest human feelings and pangs of love
and devotion. Mira addressed her lyrics to
Krishna whose persence she felt in every act of
her daily life. The lyrics are full of passion and
spiritual estasy.
<br>
<br>
<b>Vallabhacharya (1479-1531) :</b> Vallabhacharya was the next great saint of the Krishna
cult of Vaishnavism. He was born at varanasi in
1479. His father lakshman Bhatt from Telenganga was on a pilgrimage along with his family
to Kashi, where his second son Vallabhacharya
saw the light of day. He travelled much and he
took his residence in Varindaban where he started prieaching the Krishna cult. He worshipped
Lord Krishna under the title of Srinath ji. Like
kabir and Nanak, he did not consider married
life a hindrance to spiritual progress. He was the
author of a number of scholarly works in Sanskrit and Brijbhasha.
Vallabhacharya's philosophy centres round
the cenception of one personal and loving God.
He believed in the marga (path) of pushti (grace)
and bhakti (devotion). He looked upon Sri
Krishna as the highest Brahma, purushotama
and parmanand (the highest bliss).
According to Vallabhacharya, God can be
realised only by the one. he chooses and for this
choice one has to practiise bhakti. In the
expression of pushtimarga, the word marga
means path or way and the word pushti means
grace of God Mukti or salvation can be attained
by it and in no other way. Devotion or bhakti
must be without any object in view and without
any desire of fruit. It should be accompained by
love and service.
<br>
<br>
<b>Surdas (sixteenth-seventeenth century):</b> No
accout of the Bhakti movement can be complete
without describing the two great Hindu poets,
Surdas and Tulsidas. Both were saints of a high
order, but not preachers and reformers in the
formal sense, and neither of them founded a sect
or cult. We have not much information about
the principal events of Surdas's life, not even the
dates of his birth and death.
Surdas was the devotee of Lord Krishna and
Radha. He believed that salvation can be
achieved only through the devotion of Krishna
who is Saguna God. Three of his works are very
popular. They are Sur Sarawali, Sahitya Ratna
and Sur Sagar. The Sur sagar, which is said to
contain 1,25,000 verses, is not only saturated
with love and devotion, but is also notable for
depiction Krishna as a child. Surdas has
displayed a masterly knowledge of child
psychology and also expressed his sincere
devotion to the Almighty. Surdas's works and
his stray poems have produced a tremendous
inpact on the Indian Masses.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tulsidas (1532-1623):</b> Tulsidas is considered
by modern scholars as greater than Surdas, both
as a poet and as a devotee. He was born in a
Saryuparian Brahmin family in of about 1532 in
Varanasi.
<br>
<br>
His father's names was Atmaram Dubey and
his mother was Hulsi. On account of his wife
Ratnavali's taunt, he took to the life of a religious
hermit. It is presumed that he began writing his
Ram Charit Manas in 1574, when he was 42
years of age. Besides this, he wrote several other
books. such as Gitwali, Kaviawali, Vinay Patrika,
etc. The Ram Charit Manas is an expsoition of
religious devotion of the highest category.
Tulsidas was the worshipper of Rama and he
was drawn as ideal picture of his mation of God
and believed that man could reach him only
through bhakti.
Tulsidas died at the age of 91, in 1623. "He is
considered even now as a great Vaishnava
bhakta and acharya who lived in the hearts of
millions of men and women, through his
immortal Vinaya Patrika and Rom Charit
Manas".


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MINOR SECTS AND SAINTS</i></strong></div>

<b>Sankardev (1449-1568):</b> He was the greatest
religious reformer of medieval Assam. His
message centred around absolute devotion to
Vishnu of his incarnation Krishna. Its essence
was monotheism, and it came to be known as
Eka-Sarana-dharma (religion of seeding refuge

he insisted on purity as the essence of a religious
life. This aspiration was to unite the two streams
of Hindu and Muslim religious life through live.
There were some other sects known by the
same name of Satnami, both before and after
Jagjivan's time. One of these was founded by
Ghasidasa of the Cobbler caste. The followers of
this faith do not touch animal food or wine, do
not believe in imagewordhip and though

invisible. One who cannot be perceived by the
senses. The primary requirements of a religious
life, according to them, are nonviolence,
catholicity, charity, and purity. 'Do not be
anxious about the next world,' this way, 'you
will attain the highest bliss in this. Heaven and
hell are within you.' They great each other with
the words 'Aladh Kaho' (take the name of God
who is invisible).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE BHAKTI MOVEMENT IN MAHARASHTRA (MAHARASHTRA DHARMA)</i></strong></div>

The liberal religion preached by the saint
poets of Maharashtra is popularly known as
Maharashtra Dharma, which was a stream of
the medieval Bhakti movement, but socially it
was more profound, unitary and far more liberal
in the field of social reforms. The Bhakti cult in
Maharashtra centred around the shrine of
Vithoba or Vitthal the presiding diety of
Pandharpur, who was regarded as a
mainfeatation of Krishna. This movement is also
known as the Pnadharpur movement led to the
develompent of Marathi literature, modificaton
of caste exclusiveness, sanctification of family life,
elevation of the status of women, spread of the
spirit of humaneness and toleration,
subordination of ritual to love and faith, and
limitation of the excesses of polytheism.
The Bhakti movement in Maharashtra is
broadly divided into two sects. The first school
of mystics is known as Varakaris, of the mild
devatees of God Veththala of prndharpur, and
the second as Dharakaris, or the heroic followers
of the cult of Ramadasa, the devotee of God
Rama. The former are more rational, practical.
and concrete in their thoughts. The difference
between the two schools is, however, only
apparent and not real, realization of God as the
highest end of human life being common to both.
The three great teachers of the Vithoba cult were
jnaneswar Jnandeva or, Namdeva and Tukaram.
The dates of birth and of other important
events in the lives of all Maharashtra saints
expects Ramadasa are only approximately
known. It is, however, historical fact that
Nivrttinatha and jnaneswar are the founders of
the mystical school in Maharasthra, which later
developed an assumed different forms at the
hands of Namadeva Ekanatha, and Tukarama.
Bhakti Saints of Maharashtra
<br>
<br>
<b>Jnaneswar of Jnanadeva:</b> One of the earliest
Bhakti Saints of Maharashtra Jnaneswar
flourished in the 13th century. He wrote the
Marathi commentary on the Gita known as
Jnaneswari, which deserves to be reckoned
among the world's best mystical compositions.
his other works are Amratanubhava and
changadeva Prasasti.
<br>
<br>
<b>Namadeva:</b> Namadeva was born in a tailor's
family. we are told that as a child he was very
wild and in his youth he took to, vagabond life,
but certain sudden incidents moved him to the
path of spirituality, transformin him to a great
saint and a gifted poet. His Marathi poems have
genuine marks of simplicity, devotion and
melody, he was suddenly coverted to the
spiritual life, when he heard the piteous cries and
curses of the helpless wife of one of his victims.
He passed the major part of his life at
Pandharpur, and was mainly responsible for
building up the glorious tradition of the school
of thought known as Varakarisampradaya. He
was initiated into mystic life by Visoba Khechara,
who convinced Namadeva of the all-pervading
nature of God. He travelled with his younger
cotemporary, Jnaneswar. Some of his lyrical
verses are included in the Granth Sahib. The
dominant note of his thoughts is earnest and
whole-hearted devotion to God. Purification of
the heart is possible only through suffering, and
God can be realized through pure love. He wrote
a number of abhangas to show people the path
to God through repetition of His name.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ekanatha:</b> He was born at Paithan
(Aurangabad). His life was an object-lesson in
the reconciliation of practical and spiritual life,
He observed no distinction of caste and creed,
and once gave to the pariahs the food prepared
as an offering to his forefathers. His sympathies
knew no limits; he poured the holy waters of
the Godavari (brought from a long distance at
the risk of life for the worship of the Lord) into
the throat of an ass that was dying of thirst. He
published for the first time a reliable edition of
the Jnaneswari. He was a voluminous writer, and
his commentary on four verses of the Bhagavata
is famous. It was his custom to sing Kertana
(devotional composition) every day, and he
observed it ti the last day of his life, His mystic
experiences are expressed most explicitly tin this
abhangas. He popularized the vedanta
philosophy and the mystic teachings of earlier
saints. He passed away in A.D. 1598.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tukaram :</b> Tukaram was born in the family
of a farmer. He had some cattle and landed
property, but lost them all in great famine,
together with his parents, one of his two wives,
and a son. He become a bankrupt and got
disgusted with his life. His other wife was a
shrew, who abused his companion-devo-tees.
Trouble both at home and outside, Tukarama
took to the study of the works of Jnaneswar,
Namadeva, and Ekanatha, and began to
meditate on God in solitary places on the hills of
Bhamhanatha and Bhandara.
He wrote several abhangas, which embody
his teachings and are widely recited in
Maharashtra. He was contemporary of Shivaji
and refused to accept the offer of rich presents
made by him.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ramdasa:</b> He was born in 1608. He
wandered throughout India for twelve years and
finally settled at Chaphal on the banks of the
Krishna where he built a temple. He was the
spiritual guide of Shivaji. Ramdasa was born in
a period of political upheaval, and could not but
be partly affected by it. But he regarded the
realization of God as primary, and political as
only of secondary, importance in life. He was a
saint of practical temperament and
systematically organized his order. He
established his monasteries throughout
Maharashtra to serve as centres of spiritual and
practical activities. In his monumental work.
Dasabodha, be combined his vast knowledge of
various sciences and arts with the synthesizing
principle of spiritual life. He also wrote many
abhangas and some minor works, all of which
inspire a deep love for the life of God-realisation.
The greatest contributioon of the Bhakti
movement in Maharastra was in uniting the
people of Maharashtra into a nation, which
greatly helped in the rise of the Maratha
movement under Shivaji.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Mahanubhava Panth:</b> Another religious
cult founded in Maharasthra around this time
was Mahanubhava Panth. The cult fell into
disrepute and incurred unpopularity among the
Mharashtrians, perhaps because of its alleged
disbelief in the caste system, disregard of the
teachings of the Vedas, and non-adherence to
the asrama system. The leaders and followers of
the cult had to carry on their spiritual
propaganda and activities under great restraints
enforced by the State. All their holy works were,
therefore, written in symbolic script, a key to
decipher which was supplied for the first time
by V.K. Rajavade, Govinda Prabhu, a great
mystic, was the founder of this cult, and
Chakradhara its first apostle. Nagadeva
oranized the cult on a systematic basis. Bhaskara,
Kesavaraja Suri, Damodara Pandita, Visvantha,
and narayana pandita were, amongst others, the
most learned and important followers of the cult.
Of the women follower Mahadamba was an
advanced mystic and a poetess of no mean orde,
The Mahanubhavas were, in reality, the
followers of the Bhagvata, and the Sutraphatha
(a collection of aphorisms of Chakradhara) as
the standard and classical religious works. Sri
Krishna and Dattatreya were their prominent
deities. Devotion to Krishna is, in their openion,
the only way to the realization of God. This was,
therefore, primarily a cult of Sri Krishnal But
later they accepted Dattatreya - a trinity in unity
of Brahma, Vishnu, and Shiva, representing the
principles of creation, sustenance, and
dissolution of the universe, with emphasis on
Vishnu, of Vishnu as Krishna Thus th
Mahanubhava cult seems the combine the cult
of Krishna, represented by the Nathas of
Maharashtra, with that of Dattatreya,
represented by Narasimaha Saraswati and
Janardana Svamin.
