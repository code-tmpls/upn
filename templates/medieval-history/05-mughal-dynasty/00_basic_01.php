<h3>Mughal Dynasty</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BABUR</i></strong></div>

Babur ascended the throne at Farghana, a
small principality in Transoxiana, in 1494 at the
age of twelve after the death of his father. The
situation in Central Asia was not stable and
Babar had to face a lot of resistance from the
nobility itself. Although he was able to capture
Samarqand but very soon he had to retreat
because of desertion of some of his nobles. He
also lost Farghana to the Uzbegs.
Thus, the early years of Babur's rule in central
Asia were tough. During this whole period he
had plans of moving towards Hindustan. And
finally from 1517 onwards he made decisive
moves towards India. A few developments in
India at that time also helped him to act on plans
of invading India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Timurids</i></strong></div>

Babur traced his lineage from Timur the great
conqueror of Central Asia and to Chengiz Khan
the distinguished conqueror. From mother's side
he was a descendant of Mongols and from
father's side the great commander Timur. Because
of the lineage of Timur the Mughals are also
referred as Timurids.
The unstable political situation in India after
Sikandar Lodi's death convinced him of political
discontentment and disorder in the Lodi Empire.
Meanwhile there was conflict between some
Afghan chiefs with Ibrahim Lodi. Prominent
among them was Daulat Khan Lodi, the
Governor of a large part of Punjab. The Rajput
king of Mewar Rana Sanga was also asserting
his authority against Ibrahim Lodi and was
trying to increase his area of influence in north
India. Both of them sent word to Babur to invade
India. Invitations from Rana Sanga and Daulat
Khan Lodi might have encouraged Babur's
ambitions.
<br>
<br>
Babur was successful in capturing Bhira
(1519-1520), Sialkot (1520) and Lahore (1524)
in Punjab. Finally, Ibrahim Lodi and Babur's
forces met at Panipat in 1526. Babur's Soldiers
were less in number but the organization of his
army was superior. Ibrahim Lodi was defeated
in the battle of Panipat. Success at the Battle of
Panipat was a great achievement of Babur's
military tactics. Babur had an active army of only
12000 soldiers while Ibrahim's army had an
estimated strength of 100,000 soldiers. When face
to face in the battle field Babur's tactics were
unique. He effectively applied the Rumi
(Ottoman) method of warfare. He encircled
Ibrahim's army from two flanks. In the centre
his cavalry mounted attack with arrows and gun
fires by expert ottoman gunners. The trenches
and barricades provided adequate defence
against march of the enemy. The Afghan army
of Ibrahim Lodi suffered heavy causalities.
Ibrahim Lodi died in the battle field. Babur was
thus able to take control of Delhi and Agra and
got the rich treasure of Lodis. This money was
distributed among Babur's commanders and
soldiers. Victory at Panipat provided Babur a
firm ground to consolidate his conquests. But
now he was faced with a few problems:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>His nobles and commanders were eager
to return to Central Asia because they
did not like the climate of India.
Culturally also, they felt very alienated.</li>
        <li>Rajputs were rallying around under the
leadership of Rana Sanga the king of
Mewar and wanted to expel the Mughal
forces</li>
        <li>The Afghans, though defeated at
Panipat, were still a formidable force in
eastern parts of UP, Bihar and Bengal.
They were re-grouping to reclaim their
lost powers. To begin with Babur
convinced his companions and nobles
to stay back and help in consolidating
the conquered territories. After
succeeding in this difficult task, he sent
his son Humayun to face the eastern
Afghans. Rana Sanga of Mewar
succeeded to muster support of a large
number of Rajput chiefs. Prominent
among these were Jalor, Sirohi,
Dungarpur, Amber, Merta etc. Medini
Rai of Chanderi, Hasan Khan of Mewat
and Mahmud Lodi younger son of
Sikander Lodi also joined Rana with
their forces. Possibly, Rana Sanga
expected Babur to return to Kabul.
Babur's decision to stay back must have
given a big jolt to Rana Sanga's
ambitions. Babur was also fully aware
of the fact that it would be impossible
for him to consolidate his position in
India unless he shattered Rana's power.
The forces of Babur and Rana Sanga
met at Khanwa, a place near Fatehpur
Sikri. Rana Sanga was defeated in 1527
and once again the superior military
tactics of Babur succeeded. With the
defeat of Rana the biggest challenge in
north India was shattered. Though the
Mewar Rajputs received great shock at
Khanwa, Medini Rai at Malwa was still
threatening to challenge the authority
of Babur. In spite of great valour with
which the Rajputs fought in Chanderi
(1528), Babur faced little difficulty in
overcoming Medini Rai. With his defeat,
resistance across Rajputana was
completely shattered.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

But Babur had to tackle the Afghans. The
Afghans had surrendered Delhi, but they were
still powerful in the east (Bihar and parts of
Jaunpur). The success against the Afghans and
Rajputs at Panipat and Khanwa was very
significant but the resistance was still present.
However, these victories were a step forward in
the direction of the establishment of Mughal
empire. Babur died in 1530. Still the rulers of
Gujarat, Malwa and Bengal enjoyed substantial
military power and were not suppressed. It was
left to Humayun to face these regional powers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HUMAYUN'S RETREAT AND AFGHAN
REVIVAL (1530-1540)</i></strong></div>

After the death of Babur in 1530, his son
Humayun succeeded him. The situation under
Humayun was quite desperate. The main
problems faced by Humayun were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The newly conquered territories and
administration was not consolidated.</li>
        <li>Unlike Babur, Humayun did not
command the respect and esteem of
Mughal nobility.</li>
        <li>The Chaghatai nobles were not
favourably inclined towards him and
the Indian nobles, who had joined
Babur's service, deserted the Mughals
at Humayun's accession.</li>
        <li>He also confronted the hostility of the
Afghans mainly Sher Khan in Bihar on
the one hand and Bahadurshah, the
ruler of Gujarat, on the other.</li>
        <li>As per the Timurid tradition Humayun
had to share power with his brothers.
The newly established Mughal empire
had two centres of power - Humayun
was in control of Delhi, Agra and
Central India, while his brother Kamran
had Afghanistan and Punjab under
him.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



Humayun felt that the Afghans were a
bigger threat. He wanted to avoid a combined
opposition of Afghans from east and the west.
At that time Bahadur Shah had occupied Bhilsa,
Raisen, Ujjain and Gagron and was
consolidating his power. While Humayun was
besieging Chunar in the east, Bahadur Shah had
started expanding towards Malwa and
Rajputana. In such a situation Humayun was
forced to rush back to Agra (1532-33).
Continuing his expansionist policy, Bahadur
Shah attacked Chittor in 1534. Chittor had
strategic advantage as it could provide a strong
base. It would have helped his expansion in
Rajasthan particularly towards Ajmer, Nagor
and Ranthambhor. Humayun captured Mandu
and camped there because he thought that from
here he can block Bahadur Shah's return to
Gujarat. Humayun's long absence from Agra
resulted in rebellions in Doab and Agra and he
had to rush back. Mandu was now left under
the charge of Mirza Askari, the brother of
Humayun. During the period when Humayun
was busy in Gujarat to check Bahadurshah, Sher
Shah started consolidating himself in Bihar and
Bengal. Sher Shah wished to establish himself
as the undisputed Afghan leader. He invaded
the Bengal army and defeated them in the battle
of Surajgarh. Sher Shah could extract quite a
wealth from Bengal which helped him to raise a
bigger army. Now he started attacking Mughal
territories of Banaras and beyond. Humayun
was quite suspicious of Sher Shah's ambitions
but failed to estimate his capabilities. He asked
his governor of Jaunpur, Hindu Beg to check the
movements of Sher Shah. Meanwhile Sher Shah
captured Gaur (1538) the capital of Bengal. While
Humayun was moving towards Bengal Sher
Shah took control of route to Agra making
communication difficult for Humayun. On the
other hand, Hindal Mirza, brother of Humayun,
who was supposed to provide supplies for his
army, declared his independence. Now,
Humayun decided to return to Chunar. When
he reached Chausa (1539), he encamped on the
western side of the river Karmnasa. Sher Shah
attacked Humayun at the bank of the river and
defeated him. Sher Shah declared himself as an
independent king. Humayun could escape but
most of his army was destroyed. With difficulty
he could reach Agra. His brother Kamran moved
out of Agra towards Lahore leaving Humayun
with small force. Sher Shah now moved towards
Agra. Humayun also came forward with his
army and the armies of the two clashed at
Kannauj. Humayun was defeated badly in the
battle of Kannauj (1540).


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Second Afghan Empire (1540-1555)</i></strong></div>

After a gap of 14 years Sher Shah succeeded
in establishing the Afghan rule again in India in
1540. Sher Shah and his successors ruled for 15
years. This period is known as the period of
second Afghan Empire.
<br>
<br>
The founder of this Afghan rule Sher Khan
was a great tactician and able military
commander. We have already discussed his
conflict with Humayun. After defeating
Humayun he became sovereign ruler in the year
1540 and assumed the title of Sher Shah.
Sher Shah followed Humayun on his flight
till Sindh in the North West. After expelling
Humayun he started consolidating his position
in Northern and Eastern India. He defeated and
conquered Malwa in 1542 which was followed
by Chanderi. In Rajasthan he led campaigns
against Marwar, Ranthambhore, Nagor, Ajmer,
Merta Jodhpur and Bikaner. He defeated
rebellious Afghans in Bengal. By 1545 he had
established himself as the supreme ruler from
Sindh and Punjab to whole of Rajputana in the
West and Bengal in the East. Now he turned
towards Bundel Khand. Here while besieging
the fort of Kalinjar he died in 1545 in an
accidental blast of gun powder. During his brief
rule Sher Shah introduced very important
changes in administration and revenue system.
The most important ones were:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Administration</i></strong></div>

While displaying due deference to the
Afghan socio-customs, Sher Shah had the
foresight to realize that the Afghans must
gradually be weaned away from a tribal and
parochial outlook and trained to think in terms
of an empire.
<br>
<br>
He however, disfavoured the Mughal
concept of delegating undue initiative and
authority to the Wazirs. His ideal was to establish
an undiluted despotism, where all power flowed
from the monarch.
<br>
<br>
The Wazirs were substituted by a band of
secretaries, who merely implemented the king's
orders. The important secretaries were modelled
after the system of the Delhi Sultans.
Diwani-i-Wizarat was headed by a Wazir
who acted as the financial secretary. He looked
after the departments of revenue, audits and
account. Since Sher Shah possessed adequate
knowledge of revenue affairs, he took special
interest in this departments.
<br>
<br>
Diwani-i-Ariz was looked after by Ariz-iMamalik. As the military secretary, he
implemented emperor's military policy,
particularly the framing of rues and the
assignments of salaries. There was also Mir-iAtish in charge of artillery, who in rank was
equivalent to the secretaries.
Diwan-i-Insha looked after the correct
drafting of the imperial orders and the records
of the government.
Diwan-i-Qaza or the Chief Qazi constituted
the highest criminal court in the realm.
Diwan-i-Rasalat or Muhatsib was incharge
of the public trusts.
<br>
<br>
Barid-i-Mamalik was the head of the
intelligence department and was obliged to
report every important incident to the king.
Under him, there were a number of news-writers
and spies who were posted in all the towns and
markets, including the series and every important
locality, who fed the Sultan with the daily
happenings of the empire.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Provincial Administration</i></strong></div>

There was no clear demercation of either the
provinces or the duties of the governor. Similarly,
there is no mention of Subas. Considering that
there ware provinces before and after Sher
Shah's reign on the basis of historical continuity,
there must have been provinces or Subas under
Sher Shah.
The only exception was Bengal, where the
constant turmoil, convinced with of the futility
of placing the province under the one individual.
He, therefore, divided it into a number of
divisions, under respective Jagirdars.
No definite information, however, is
available of Sher Shah's deliberate organization
of the Provincial administration, though in a vast
empire, Sher Shah with his flair for
administration could not have overlooked the
important of a well organized provincial
administration as a link between the central and
the local government.
<br>
<br>
Administration At District Level And Below
A province comprised a number of Sarkars,
which were further sub divided into Parganas.
Here, Sher Shah seems to have retained the
existing size of the Shiqas and the Parganas. The
word Shiq came to be used under the Tughlaqs
and denoted a sub-division of privince.
There were two chief officers of the Sarkars
as Chief Shiqdar or Shiqdar-i-Shiqdaran and
Chief Munsif r Munsif-i-Munsiftan.
The Chief Shiqdar enjoyed tremendous
prestige and power and the Faujdar of Akbar's
reign was modelled on him. His chief duty was
to maintain law and order in the district and he
was given a respectable force to command. While
he had no direct responsibility to collect the landrevenue, he was obliged to render assistance in
securing the collection by using coercion, if
necessary. Besides, he also supervised the work
of the various Shiqdars in the Parganas.
The Munsif-Munsifan's primary function was
to supervise the assessment and collection of
revenue. He also supervised the work of the
subordinate Munsifs. To prevent corruption and
nepotism, they were transferred every year or
two.
<br>
<br>
Apart from these two officers, the chronicles
do not mention any other officers. An
administrative hierachy of the clerks and
accountants, however, must have existed to
render help.
Each Sarkar comprised of a number of
Parganas. The Shiqdar or Amil was incharge of
the Pargana. But his chief function was to collect
the land-revenue. Besides, there was a Munsif
or Amin, who supervised the measurement of
the land and settled disputes regarding the size
of the holdings. The interests of cultivators, their
customs and practices, were protected by a
semi-official Qanungo, the Pargana record
keeper, whose office was usually hereditary. The
Shiqdar was assited by two clerks known as
Karkuns who kept the records in Hindi and
Persion. The treasure and cash were kept by
Khazanadar or Fotadar.
In each village, there was the hereditary
office of the Muqaddam, Mukhiya or the head
man, who acted as the chief link between the
government and the village. He was responsible
for the collection of the land-revenue from the
villages and was also allowed a precentage of
the collection. He was helped by a Patwari, an
official, who was not appointed by the
government but was maintained by the villagers.
He was also the village record-keeper.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Military Organisation</i></strong></div>

Sher Shah initiated the practice f paying the
soldiers fixed salaries from the treasury. In a bid
to bring the soldiers in direct touch with himself,
Sher Shah as their commander-in-chief and the
pay master general, recruited soldiers himself and
fixed their salaries after personally inspecting
them.
Sher Shah strictly enforced the Khilji policy
of branding of horses (Dagh) and preparing
descriptive rolls (Huliya) of the soldiers. He thus
attempted to eliminate corruption by preventing
the practice of proxy at the time of military
review.
<br>
<br>
The central army consisted of 1,50,000
cavalry, 50,000 infantry and an elephant force
of 5,000. Sher shah's military set-up did not have
a regular artillery. The army was posted in
cantonments spread all over the country, of
which Rohtas and Delhi were the most
important.
There is no contemporary mention of the
details of the army divisions though one division
(Fauj), was placed under Faujdar. Besides, these,
additional troops were supplied by the provincial
governors in times of emergencies.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Judicial System</i></strong></div>

From the comparative silence of the
contemporary chronicles it may be inferred that
Sher Shah did not introduce any innovations in
judicial department. Neverthless, his severe but
just rule resulted in treating all, including his kith
and kin, as equals before law.
<br>
<br>
He held that, "justice is the most excellent of
religious rites and it is approved both by the
kings of the infides and the faithful" and
consisted in giving fair and honest deal to all
men. He made no difference between the high
and the low or rich and the poor and imparted
justice to all with equal vigour. Sher Shah himself
acted as the highest court and personally decided
the cases of nobles and high officials.
The civil cases of the Muslims were decided,
as in the past, by the Kazi, Another officer, Mir
Adl, is mentioned but his functions are not
specified. The Criminal law was uniform and
rigorously imposed. Robbers, thieves as also the
oppressors of the cultivators were severely
punished. Flogging, amputation of limbs and
executions were freely imparted.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Police System</i></strong></div>

As for the police, there was no separate
department. Sher Shah largely acted on the
axiom of local responsibility for maintaining
peace.
The Shiqdars and the Shiqdar-i-Shiqdaran
were responsible for the maintenance of law and
order in Parganas and Sarkars. Just as the village
headmen were obliged to look after their areas.
The largest responsibility rested with the
Muqaddams and Chowdharies, who were
severely punished, in case they failed to detect
the crimes.
Sher Shah thus attempted to involve the
people at large in the maintenance of law and
order in their regions.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Land Revenue System</i></strong></div>

Sher Shah's most striking contribution was
made in the field of revenue.
The Turko-Afghan Sultans, with the
exception of Tughlaqs, had formulated no
deliberate principles of land revenue. Generally
unconcerned with the production yield,
standardisation of crops and welfare schemes
for the peasants, the Sultans has confined their
attention to a strict collection of the landrevenue.
The incidence of the land-revenue varied
from Sultan to Sultan with the maximum ceiling
at fifty per cent under Ala-ud-di Khilji. While
the lack of a scientific method of assessment
handicapped the peasants vis-a-vis the collectors,
the system of granting Jagirs and assisgnments
of revenue, further failed to promote any direct
relations between the state and the peasant. The
absence of any royal inclination towards the
revenue affairs, only encouraged the hereditary
class of revenue collectors, namely, the
Muqaddams and Chowdharies, who were in sole
possession of the revenue secrets, to misuse their
power and practice corruption and atrocities on
the peasants.
<br>
<br>
Sher Shah, therefore, inherited the intricate
problems of conciliating and structing the
peasantry relations with the state and fixing a
rational demand based on a correct assessment
of the produce. Sher Shah, however, as the only
sovereign who is known to have gained a
practical experience in managing a small body
of peasants before rising to the throne came with
his scheme of revenue settlement ready made and
successfully tested by experiment. It was but an
extension of the system introductioned by him
at Sasaram.
As a monarch, he unilatereally decided that
the best system of assessment must be based on
actual measurement. According, the empire was
surveyed. In order to ensure the accuracy of
measurement and honestry of collection he fixed
the wages of the measurers and the collectors.
The uniform system of measurement in spite
of strong opposition from some quarters, was
enforced all over the empire, with the exception
of Multan where political turmoil could
endanger the security of the State. But there too,
a record was kept of the settlement made
between the government and the cultivator, and
the latter was given a title deed (Patta) in which
conditions of the settlement were specifically
stated.
<br>
<br>
According to the schedule of Sher Shah's
assessment rates the revenue on perishable
articles was fixed in cash rates, but for all the
principal staple crops, the land was classified
into three classes-good, middling and bad. After
the average produce of the three was added, onethird of the total was taken as the average
produce of each bigha for revenue purposes. Of
this, one-third was demanded as the share of
the government. It could be paid in cash or in
kind though the former mode was preferred. In
case of cash payments, the state demand was
fixed according to the prices prevalent in the
near markets and a schedule of crop of crop rates
was preserved indicating the method and the
rates of assessment.
The state gave a patta to each cultivator,
which specified the state demand. He was also
obliged to sign a qabuliat (deed of agreement)
promising to honour the revenue due from him.
Both the documents contained information on
the size of the plot.
Sher Shah's revenue settlement has been
unanimously acclaimed. And it has been
contended hat it provided the basis for Todar
Mal's bandobust in Akbar's reign, as also for the
Ryotwari system in British India.
Notwithstanding its obvious strengths it would
be unrealistic to describe his revenue settlement
as a master-piece; for the system was not without
defects.
<br>
<br>
Sher Shah was the first ruler who considered
the welfare of the people as essential for the
interests of the state. He was benign in times of
drought and famine. The state, under such
circumstances, would lend money and material
to the cultivators. Besides, his standing
instruction to the army not to damage any crops
and in any damage, to adequately compensate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Currency Reforms</i></strong></div>

He removed the currency which had debased
under the later Turko-Afghan regimes and
instead issued well executed coins of gold, Silver
and Copper of a uniform standard. His silver
rupee which weighed 180 grams and contained
175 grains of silver was retained throughout the
Mughal period as also by the British East India
Company, till 1885. Besides the coins of smaller
fractions of a rupee, the copper coins too had
fractions of half quarter, eighth and sixteenth.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Promotion Of Trade And Commerce</i></strong></div>

Sher Shah gave every possible encouragement to the trade and commerce and took a
number of measures for this purpose. He did
away with all the internal custom duties with
the exception of the two. These two duties were
charged at the time of entry of the goods in the
kingdom and at the time of the actual sale. Foreign goods were permitted to enter Bengal duty
free. Sher Shah paid special attention tot he safety and convenience of the merchants and had
issued specific instructions to his officers in this
regards.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Promotion Of Education</i></strong></div>

Sher Shah not only took necessary measures
to ameliorate the condition of the people but also
paid attention to the promotion of education. He
gave liberal grants to both the Hindu and
Muslim educational institutions. The Hindus
were free to regulate their educational
institutions and Sher Shah did not interfere in
their working. Similarly, the Muslim educational
institution were mainly attached with mosques
and imparted elementary education to the
children. The taught Persian and Arabic. Sher
Shah also established Madrasas for higher
education. To help the poor and brilliant students
he awarded liberal scholarships. Sher Shah also
made liberal provisions for the support of blind,
the old, the weak, widows etc.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religious Policy</i></strong></div>

Generally Sher Shah tried to keep religion ans
politics separate and did not follow any
systematic policy of prosecution as was done by
the rulers of Delhi before him. On the whole his
policy towards the Hindus was very tollerant.
Sher Shah persued a liberal policy towards the
Hindus without offending his Muslim subjects.
Sher Shah believed that Islam should be given
its due position of supremacy but this should not
be done at the cost of regarding Hinduism. In
those days, this attitude and policy was more
useful and appropriate, according to which he
(Sher Shah) could openly favour the Hindus
without displeasing the Muslim as well.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Public Works</i></strong></div>

The building of a fresh net work of the roads
ans serais all over the empire galvanished trade
and tradesmen into action. Of his four great
roads: (I) One ran from sonargaon in Bengal
through Agra, Delhi and Lahore to the Indus ;
(ii) from Agra to Mandu; (iii) from Lahore to
Multan. Primarily planned for military purposes,
they proved equally effective for the growth of
trade ans commerce. Along both sides of these
roads, Sher Shah ordered the planting of fruit
trees and the sinking of fresh wells.
Another important feature of the public
works comprised the building of the Serais,
which higherto were neither so well planned nor
well spread. The Serais were fully furnished, with
well equipped kitchens and cooks for both the
Hindus and the Muslims. Sher Shah also repaired
about 1,700 Caravan Serais for the efficiency of
the royal posts. Soon, the Serais functioned as
post offices and marketing centres and Sher Shah
posted news-readers in the various Serais to keep
abreast of the local gossip.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CAUSES OF THE DOWNFALL
OF SUR EMPIRE</i></strong></div>
 
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Sur empire founded by Sher Shah fell
due to many causes. First, his successors were
thoroughly incompetent and unfit to carry on
his work of reconstruction. Islam Shah was
responsible for the destruction of many of those
nobles who had a lot under Sher Shah.
Muhammad Adil was worse than his
predecessor. He added to the discontentment
prevailing among the Afghan chiefs. The rise of
Hemu made them jealous.</li>
        <li>Secondly, in the time of Muhammad Adil,
there were five Afghan rulers struggling for
power. There was no national solidarity among
the Afghans. They were quarreling among
themselves. This spelled their ruin.</li>
        <li>Thirdly, Sher Shah worked with the ideal of
bringing about regeneration among the Afghans
and did all that he could to bring them on a
common platform. There was no such feeling
among the Afghans chiefs or his successors. They
all struggled for personal gain.</li>
        <li>Fourthly, the character of the Afghan
deteriorated. They lost all sense of self-respect.
They did not honour their sword. They did not
attach importance to the sanctity of their word.
Such a character can not create or maintain
empire.</li>
        <li>Fifthly, the successors of Sher Shah ignored
the lot of the peasantry. Nothing was done to
protect them. The nobles became tyrants and
crushed the people.</li>
        <li>Sixthly, the example of Sher Shah was
forgotten. The forts which he built in various
parts of the country for purposes of defence,
became centres of michief and sedition. A lot of
money was wasted on punitive expenditions and
bootless skirmishes. There was no proper
collection of revenues. The officers kept the same
to themselves.</li>
        <li>Seventhly, the Afghans did not bother to give
justice to the people. The latter were ruled in an
arbitrary manner. All kinds of punishements
were inficted on them. There was no regard for
life or property. There was no bureaucracy
devoted to the task of the state and no military
class to die for its defence. There was absolutely
no discipline anywhere.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AKBAR</i></strong></div>

Akbar was one of the greatest monarchs of
India. He succeeded the throne after his father
Humayun's death. But his position was
dangerous because Delhi was seized by the
Afghans. Their commander-in-Chief, Hemu, was
in charge of it. In the second Battle of Panipat in
1556, Hemu was almost on the point of victory.
But an arrow pierced his eye and he became
unconscious. His army fled and the fortune
favoured Akbar. The Mughal victory was
decisive.
<br>
<br>
During the first five years of Akbar's reign,
Bairam Khan acted as his regent. He
consolidated the Mughal empire. After five years
he was removed by Akbar due to court intrigues
and sent to Mecca. But on his way Bairam was
killed by an Afghan.
Akbar's military conquests were extensive.
He conquered northern India from Agra to
Gujarat and then from Agra to Bengal. He
strengthened the northwest frontier. Later, he
went to the Deccan.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Relations with Rajputs</i></strong></div>

The Rajput policy of Akbar was notable. He
married the Rajput princess, the daughter of Raja
Bharamal. It was a turning point in the history
of Mughals. Rajputs served the Mughals for four
generations. Many of them rose to the positions
of military generals. Raja Bhagawan Das and
Raja Man Singh were given senior positions in
the administration by Akbar. One by one, all
Rajput states submitted to Akbar.
But the Ranas of Mewar continued to defy
despite several defeats. In the Battle of
Haldighati, Rana Pratap Singh was severely
defeated by the Mughal army led by Man Singh
in 1576. Following the defeat of Mewar, most of
the leading Rajput rulers had accepted Akbar's
suzerainty. Akbar's Rajput policy was combined
with a broad religious toleration. He abolished
the pilgrim tax and later the jiziya. The Rajput
policy of Akbar proved to be beneficial to the
Mughal state as well as to the Rajputs. The
alliance secured to the Mughals the services of
the bravest warriors. On the other hand it
ensured peace in Rajasthan and a number of
Rajputs who joined the Mughal service rose to
important positions.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religious Policy</i></strong></div>

Akbar rose to fame in the pages of history
due to his religious policy. Various factors were
responsible for his religious ideas. The most
important among them were his early contacts
with the sufi saints, the teachings of his tutor
Abdul Latif, his marriage with Rajput women,
his association with intellectual giants like Shaikh
Mubarak and his two illustrious sons - Abul Faizi
and Abul Fazl - and his ambition to establish an
empire in Hindustan.
In the beginning of his life, Akbar was a pious
Muslim. He abolished the pilgrim tax and in
1562, he abolished jiziya. He allowed his Hindu
wives to worship their own gods. Later, he
became a skeptical Muslim. In 1575, he ordered
for the construction of Ibadat Khana (House of
worship) at his new capital Fatepur Sikri. Akbar
invited learned scholars from all religions like
Hinduism, Jainism, Christianity and
Zoroastrianism. He disliked the interference of
the Muslim Ulemas in political matters. In 1579,
he issued the "Infallibility Decree" by which he
asserted his religious powers.
In 1582, he promulgated a new religion called
Din Ilahi or Divine Faith. It believes in one God.
It contained good points of all religions. Its basis
was rational. It upholds no dogma. It was aimed
at bridging the gulf that separated different
religions. However, his new faith proved to be a
failure. It fizzled out after his death. Even during
his life time, it had only fifteen followers
including Birbal. Akbar did not compel anyone
to his new faith.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Land Revenue Administration</i></strong></div>

Akbar made some experiments in the land
revenue administration with the help of Raja
Todar Mal. The land revenue system of Akbar
was called Zabti or Bandobast system. It was
further improved by Raja Todar Mal. It was
known as Dahsala System which was completed
in 1580. By this system, Todar Mal introduced a
uniform system of land measurement. The
revenue was fixed on the average yield of land
assessed on the basis of past ten years. The land
was also divided into four categories - Polaj
(cultivated every year), Parauti (once in two
years), Chachar (once in three or four years) and
Banjar (once in five or more years). Payment of
revenue was made generally in cash.
Mansabdari System Akbar introduced the
Mansabdari system in his administration. Under
this system every officer was assigned a rank
(mansab). The lowest rank was 10 and the
highest was 5000 for the nobles. Princes of royal
blood received even higher ranks. The ranks were
divided into two - zat and sawar. Zat means
personal and it fixed the personal status of a
person. Sawar rank indicated the number of
cavalrymen of a person who was required to
maintain. Every sawar had to maintain at least
two horses. The mansab rank was not
hereditary. All appointments and promotions as
well as dismissals were directly made by the
emperor.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JAHANGIR (1605-1627)</i></strong></div>

When Akbar died, prince Salim succeeded
with the title Jahangir (Conqueror of World) in
1605. Jahangir's rule witnessed a spate of
rebellions. His son Khusrau revolted but was
defeated and imprisoned. One of his supporters,
Guru Arjun, the fifth Sikh Guru, was beheaded.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nur Jahan</i></strong></div>

In 1611, Jahangir married Mehrunnisa who
was known as Nur Jahan (Light of World). Her
father Itimaduddauala was a respectable person.
He was given the post of chief diwan. Other
members of her family also benefited from this
alliance. Nur Jahan's elder brother Asaf Khan
was appointed as Khan-i-Saman, a post reserved
for the nobles. In 1612, Asaf Khan's daughter,
Arjumand Banu Begum (later known as
Mumtaj), married Jahangir's third son, prince
Khurram (later Shah Jahan). It was believed by
some historians that Nur Jahan formed a group
of "junta" and this led to two factions in the
Mughal court.
<br>
<br>
This drove Shah Jahan into rebellion against
his father in 1622, since he felt that Jahangir was
completely under Nur Jahan's influence.
However, this view is not accepted by some other
historians. Till Jahangir became weak due to ill
health, he only took important political decisions.
It is revealed from his autobiography. However,
it is clear that Nur Jahan dominated the royal
household and set new fashions based on Persian
traditions. She encouraged Persian art and
culture in the court. She was a constant
companion of Jahangir and even joined him in
his hunting.
<br>
<br>
The rise of Shah Jahan was due to his
personal ambitions. He rose in revolt against his
father who ordered him to go to Kandahar. This
rebellion distracted the activities of the empire
for four years. After Jahangir's death in 1627,
Shah Jahan reached Agra with the support of
the nobles and the army. Nur Jahan was given a
pension and lived a retired life till her death
eighteen years later.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SHAH JAHAN (1627-1658)</i></strong></div>

Shah Jahan launched a prolonged campaign
in the northwest frontier to recover Kandahar
and other ancestral lands. The Mughal army lost
more than five thousand lives during the
successive invasions between 1639 and 1647.
Then Shah Jahan realized the futility of his
ambition and stopped fighting.
His Deccan policy was more successful. He
defeated the forces of Ahmadnagar and annexed
it. Both Bijapur and Golkonda signed a treaty
with the emperor. Shah Jahan carved four
Mughal provinces in the Deccan - Khandesh,
Berar, Telungana and Daulatabad. They were
put under the control of his son Aurangazeb.
War of Succession
The last years of Shah Jahan's reign were
clouded by a bitter war of succession among his
four sons - Dara Shikoh (crown prince), Shuja
(governor of Bengal), Aurangazeb (governor of
Deccan) and Murad Baksh (governor of Malwa
and Gujarat). Towards the end of 1657, Shah
Jahan fell ill at Delhi for some time but later
recovered. But the princes started fighting for
the Mughal throne.
<br>
<br>
Aurangazeb emerged victorious in this
struggle. He entered the Agra fort after defeating
Dara. He forced Shah Jahan to surrender. Shah
Jahan was confined to the female apartments in
the Agra fort and strictly put under vigil. But he
was not ill-treated. Shah Jahan lived for eight
long years lovingly nursed by his daughter
Jahanara. He died in 1666 and buried beside his
wife's grave in the Taj Mahal.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AURANGAZEB (1658-1707)</i></strong></div>

Aurangazeb was one of the ablest of the
Mughal kings. He assumed the title Alamgir,
World Conqueror. His military campaigns in his
first ten years of reign were a great success. He
suppressed the minor revolts. But he faced
serious difficulties in the latter part of his reign.
The Jats and Satnamis and also the Sikhs revolted
against him. These revolts were induced by his
harsh religious policy.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Deccan Policy</i></strong></div>

The Deccan policy of the Mughals started
from the reign of Akbar, who conquered
Khandesh and Berar. Jahangir fought against
Malik Amber of Ahmadnagar. During the Shah
Jahan's reign, Aurangazeb, as governor of
Deccan, followed an aggressive Deccan policy.
When he became the Mughal emperor, for the
first twenty five years, he concentrated on the
northwest frontier. At that time, the Maratha
ruler, Sivaji carved out an independent Maratha
kingdom in the territories of north and south
Konkan. To contain the spread of the Marathas,
Aurangazeb decided to invade Bijapur and
Golkonda. He defeated Sikandar Shah of Bijapur
and annexed his kingdom. Then, he proceeded
against Golkonda and eliminated the Kutb Shahi
dynasty. It was also annexed by him. In fact,
the destruction of the Deccan kingdoms was a
political blunder on the part of Aurangazeb. The
barrier between the Mughals and the Marathas
was removed and there ensued a direct
confrontation between them. Also, his Deccan
campaigns exhausted the Mughal treasury.
According to J.N. Sarkar, the Deccan ulcer
ruined Aurangazeb.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Religious Policy</i></strong></div>

Aurangazeb was a staunch and orthodox
Muslim in his personal life. His ideal was to
transform India into an Islamic state. He created
a separate department to enforce moral codes
under a high-powered officer called Muhtasib.
Drinking was prohibited. Cultivation and use of
bhang and other drugs were banned.
Aurangazeb forbade music in the Mughal court.
He discontinued the practice of Jarokhadarshan.
He also discontinued the celebration of Dasarah
and royal astronomers and astrologers were also
dismissed from service.
<br>
<br>
Initially Aurangazeb banned the
construction of new Hindu temples and repair
of old temples. Then he began a policy of
destroying Hindu temples. The celebrated
temples at Mathura and Benares were reduced
to ruins. In 1679, he reimposed jiziya and pilgrim
tax. He was also not tolerant of other Muslim
sects. The celebration of Muharram was stopped.
He was also against the Sikhs and he executed
the ninth Sikh Guru Tej Bahadur. This had
resulted in the transformation of Sikhs into a
warring community.
His religious policy was responsible for
turning the Rajputs, the Marathas and Sikhs into
the enemies of Mughal empire. It had also
resulted in the rebellions of the Jats of Mathura
and the Satnamis of Mewar. Therefore,
Aurangazeb was held responsible for the decline
of the Mughal empire.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Revolts Against Aurangzeb</i></strong></div>

The generally upheld view is that
Aurangzeb's religious persecution of the Hindus
alienated the various sections of the Hindu
community who retaliated by resorting to arms.
However, it would be a misnomer to group all
the non-Muslim communities of Marathas,
Rajputs, Bundelas, Sikhs and Satnamis under the
same banner and term their uprisings as a Hindu
reaction to Aurangzeb's policy of religious
persecution. Firstly they had no common
political aspirations that could bind them
together. In fact, the marathas including Shivaji,
hwn raiding the countryside proved equally
ruthless towards the Hindus and the Muslims
of Surat, Carnatic and Konkan. Of the Rajputs
too, there is enough evidence to corroborate that
Rani Hadi, at one stage was pliable to the
imperial proposal of destroying the temples in
the Jodhpur principality as the price for securing
imperial support for Ajit Singh's candidature to
the Jodhpur throne. Similarly, Raja Ram Singh,
son of Jai Singh, did help the Mughals in
destroying the temples. Religion undoubtedly
was a contributory factor in alienating the
Rajputs, as also the other Hindu communities.
Primarily, however, it was Aurangzeb's failure
to correctly appraise Shivaji's ability and inability
to feel the deep sensitivity of the Rajput traditions
that alienated these communities. Similarly, for
the other communities, besides his anti-Hindu
measures, there were political, social and
economic factors of equal intensity that drove
them into rebellion. As for Aurangzeb's
operations within the narrow orthodox
framework, it led him to interpret these uprisings
as Hindu rebellions against the Muslim State and
therefore, deserving of utmost ruthless
punishment which in turn could refrain the other
Hindu and Muslim subjects from indulging in
similar activities as also impress the orthodox
Muslims of the Emperor's sincerity towards
Islam.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Revolt of the Jats</i></strong></div>

Bold, brave and ferocious with a deep sense
of loyalty towards their tribal organisation, the
Jat peasantry was more akin to any martial
community. They were notorious for cattle-lifting
who frequently, raided the traders between Agra
and Delhi. Confined to the not so fertile regions
of west of Agra, they constituted the marginal
sections of peasantry. Conseqeuntly, they always
felt the economic pressure of the stringent
Mughal measures for than their counterparts in
the fertile regions of Punjab. Under Jahangir and
Shahjahan too, they had deployed arms in order
to express their economic discontentment. The
situation worsened under Aurangzeb when
Abdur Nabi, the Faujdar of mathura, through
extreme stringency, successfully collected a sum
of over thirteen lakhs for the state treasury. He
also hurt their religious sentiments by building a
mosque on the ruins of a Hindu temple. In 1669
A.D. the Jats under their leader Gokul, revolted.
They killed the Faujdar and plundered the
Pargana of Sadabad. The rebellion soon spread
to other districts. Aurangzeb, furious, was
determined to ruthlessly suppress the rebellion.
Gokul and his limbs were publicly displayed. The
Jats, however, remained defiant and in 1686 A.D.
once again rose in revolt, under Rajaram. He too,
was slain but his nephew, Churaman, continued
the Jat resistance till Aurangzeb's death.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Revolt of the Satnamis</i></strong></div>

They were a peasant religious brotherbood
who resided in Narnol. Its other memebrs
belonged to the low professions. Firmly united
and militant, they never hesitated to use arms to
aid the harassed members. Thus when a Satnami
cultivator was killed by a Muslim soldier, the
whole tribe arose to seek to seek revenge and
broke into rebellion. When, of the Mughal efforts,
they could not be quelled, the Mughals resorted
to ruthless warfare. Over a thousand Satnamis
were slain before peace was secured in the
region. The Jats and the Satnamis revolts only
convinced Aurangzeb of the disloyalty of the
Hindus to the Mughals state who therefore
needed to be ruthlessly suppressed. Moreover, it
also convinced him that only the emergence of
an Islamic state would reduce the Hindus to their
proper place in State.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Revolt of the Sikhs</i></strong></div>

The Sikh organisation was founded by Guru
Nanak, a devout social reformer, as a peaceful
universal brotherhood which was free from the
shackles of caste and community. Under the next
three Gurus too, the community remained
peaceful and enjoyed amicable relation with
Akbar who granted Guru Ram Das a piece of
land which became renowned as Amritsar. The
fifth Guru, Arjan Singh, proved a more dynamic
and zealous organiser. He wielded the
community into one compact whole. He also the
first Guru who actively participated in politics.
Consequently, the Mughal-Sikh conflict can be
traced to Jahangir's reign. He ordered Arjan
Singh's execution. This was done on purely
grounds for sheltering the fugitive Khusrav and
in no way was it accompanied by the religious
persecution of the Sikhs. Nevertheless, the act
deeply embittered the Sikhs against the Mughals.
Under their next leader, Har Gobind, the
character of the Sikh movement, for the first
time, became more militant, while its democratic
social set up attracted the Jat peasantry in large
numbers. Henceforth, any harshness towards
the peasantry was regarded as an oppression by
the Mughal state towards the Sikhs. The military
character was further developed under Guru
Teg Bahadur who in order to strengthen the Sikh
interests encouraged the creation of a state within
the state.
<br>
<br>
In the earlier years of Aurangzeb's reign,
there was no conflict between Teg Bahadur and
Aurangzeb. However once the Guru publicly
condemned Aurangzeb's anti-Hindu measures
as is clearly evident from the support that he
rendered to the Hindu population of Kashmir,
Aurangzeb became suspicious of the Guru's
motives.
Their relation rapidly deteriorated and
ultimately resulted in the gruesome murder of
Teg Bahadur in 1675 A.D. According to the
legendary sources, when his head was struck off,
a paper was found containing the words Sir dia
sar na dia (he gave his head but not his secret).
While Guru Teg Bahadur's persecution was not
accompanied by the annihilation of the sons;
(Ram Rai continued to live at the Mughal court
and his sons were granted mansabs).
Nevertheless, his execution did horrify the
country. The last Guru, Gobind Singh, was
determined to militarily strengthen his
community. To unite them, he formed the
brotherhood of Khalsa which free of caste and
creed, advocated equality of mankind. To this
end, he initiated the practice of drinking water,
conservated by a sword or dagger (Amrit
chakna). To distinguish the member from other
communities, they were asked to wear five
things-Kanghi (comb), Kachha (underwear),
Kara (iron bangle), Kesh and Kirpan (sword).
Henceforth, the Guru lived like a regal monarch,
holding court, building forts with the help of his
followers who were as zealously dedicated to
the cause of Skihism as the soldiers of Islam. Their
expansionist activities inevitably led ta a clash
of arms with the Mughals. The Sikhs were
defeated, his two sons were executed while the
Guru ultimately escaped and settled at
Anandpur. Aurangzeb, himself, fast
approaching his end, felt remorsed. With no
cause for further altercation, he promised the
Guru an honourable reception. While the Guru,
en route, received news of the Emperor's demise.
Guru Govind Singh himself was murdered
by an Afghan in 1708 A.D. The news of his
murder once again created an explosive
atmosphere in Punjab, a land which was hitherto
clam. It also accentuated the anit-Muslim
sentiments in the country and affected the
peasants loyalty towards the Mughal empire.
Guru Gobind's aspirations of founding a Sikh
state were completed by Banda, who the Guru
had nominated as his military successor.
Personality and Character of Aurangazeb
In his private life, Aurangazeb was
industrious and disciplined. He was very simple
in food and dress. He earned money for his
personal expenses by copying Quran and selling
those copies. He did not consume wine. He was
learned and proficient in Arabic and Persian
languages. He was a lover of books. He was
devoted to his religion and conducted prayers
five times a day. He strictly observed the Ramzan
fasting.
<br>
<br>
In the political field, Aurangazeb committed
serious mistakes. He misunderstood the true
nature of the Maratha movement and
antagonized them. Also, he failed to solve the
Maratha problem and left an open sore. His
policy towards Shia Deccan Sultanates also
proved to be a wrong policy.
His religious policy was also not successful.
Aurangazeb was an orthodox Sunni Muslim.
But his move to apply his religious thought
rigidly in a non-Muslim society was a failure.
His antagonistic policies towards non-Muslims
did not help him to rally the Muslims to his side.
On the other hand it had strengthened political
enemies of the Mughal Empire. Deccan
sultanates were partly due to his hatred of the
Shia faith.
