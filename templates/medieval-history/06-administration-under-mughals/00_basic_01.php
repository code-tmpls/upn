<h3>Administration Under Mughals</h3>



The Mughals retained many features of the
administrative system of the Sultanate and
Shershah .Under Shershah the administrative
units of Pargana (a group of villages), sarkar (a
group of parganas) and groups of sarkars (some
what like subas or province) were placed under
specific offices.The Mughals formalized a new
territorial unit called suba. Institutions of Jagir
and Mansab system were also introduced by the
Mughals.Thus change and continuity both
marked the Mughal administrative structure
which brought about a high degree of
centralisation in the system.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Emperor</i></strong></div>
        The Emperor was the supreme head of the
administration and controlled all military and
judicial powers.All officers in Mughal
administration owed their power and position
to the Emperor.The Emperor had authority to
appoint, promote, and remove officials at his
pleasure.There was no pressure institutional or
otherwise on the Emperor. For smooth
functioning of the empire a few departments
were created.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Wakil and Wazir</i></strong></div>
        The institution of Wizarat (or Wikalat since
both were used interchangeably) was present in
some form during the Delhi Sultanate also. The
position of Wazir had lost its preeminent position
during the period of Afghan rulers in the Delhi
Sultanate. The position of the wazir was revived
under the Mughals. Babur's and Humayun's
wazir enjoyed great powers.The period during
which Bairam Khan (1556-60) was regent of
Akbar, saw the rise of wakil-wazir with
unlimited powers. Akbar in his determination
to curb the powers of wazir later on took away
the financial powers from him.This was a big
jolt to wazir's power.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Diwan-i-Kul</i></strong></div>
        Diwan-i Kul was the chief diwan. He was
responsible for revenue and finances.Akbar had
strengthened the office of diwan by entrusting
the revenue powers to the diwan. The diwan
used to inspect all transaction and payments in
all departments and supervised the provincial
diwans. The entire revenue collection and
expenditure of the empire was under his charge.
The diwans were to report about state finance
to the Emperor on daily basis.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mir Bakshin</i></strong></div>
        Mir Bakshi looked after all matters pertaining
to the military administration. The orders of
appointment of mansabdars and their salary
papers were endorsed and passed by him. He
kept a strict watch over proper maintenance of
the sanctioned size of armed contingents and
war equipage by the mansabdars. The new
entrants seeking service were presented to the
Emperor by the Mir Bakshi.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sadr-us Sudur</i></strong></div>
        The Sadr-us Sudur was the head of the
ecclesiastical department. His chief duty was to
protect the laws of the Shariat. The office of the
Sadr used to distribute allowances and stipends
to the eligible persons and religious institutions.
It made this office very lucrative during the first
twenty-five years of Akbar's reign. The
promulgation of Mahzar in 1580 restricted his
authority. According to Mahzar Akbar's view
was to prevail in case of conflicting views among
religious scholars.This officer also regulated the
matters of revenue free grants given for religious
and charitable purposes. Later several restrictions
were placed on the authority of the Sadr for
award of revenue free grants also. Muhtasibs
(censors of public morals) were appointed to
ensure the general observance of the rules of
morality. He also used to examine weights and
measures and enforce fair prices etc.
        </li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mir Saman</i></strong></div>
        The Mir Saman was the officer in-charge of
the royal Karkhanas. He was responsible for all
kinds of purchases and their storage for the royal
household. He was also to supervise the
manufacturing of different articles for the use of
royal household.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATION</i></strong></div>


The Mughal Empire was divided into twelve
provinces or subas by Akbar.These were
Allhabad, Agra, Awadh, Ajmer, Ahmedabad,
Bihar, Bengal, Delhi, Kabul, Lahore, Malwa and
Multan. Later on Ahmednagar, Bearar and
Khandesh were added. With the expansion of
Mughal empire the number of provinces
increased to twenty. Each suba was placed
under a Subedar or provincial governor who was
directly appointed by the Emperor. The subedar
was head of the province and responsible for
maintenance of general law and order. He was
to encourage agriculture, trade and commerce
and take steps to enhance the revenue of the
state. He was also to suppress rebellions and
provide army for expeditions. The head of the
revenue department in the suba was the Diwan.
He was appointed by the Emperor and was an
independent officer. He was to supervise the
revenue collection in the suba and maintain an
account of all expenditures.He was also expected
to increase the area under cultivation. In many
cases advance loans (taqavi) were given to
peasants through his office. The Bakshi in the
province performed the same functions as were
performed by Mir Bakshi at the centre. He was
appointed by the imperial court at the
recommendations of the Mir Bakshi. He was
responsible for checking and inspecting the
horses and soldiers maintained by the
mansabdars in the suba. He issued the paybills
of both the mansabdars and the soldiers. Often
his office was combined with Waqainiqar. In this
capacity his duty was to inform the centre about
the happenings in his province.
<br>
<br>
The representative of the central Sadr (Sadrus sudur) at the provincial level was called Sadr.
He was responsible for the welfare of those who
were engaged in religious activities and learning.
He also looked after the judicial department and
in that capacity supervised the works of the
Qazis.
There were some other officers also who were
appointed at the provincial level. Darogai-i-Dak
was responsible for maintaining the communication channel. He used to pass on letters to the
court through the postal runners (Merwars).
Waqainavis and waqainigars were appointed to
provide reports directly to the Emperor.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LOCAL ADMINISTRATION</i></strong></div>

The provinces or subas were divided into
Sarkars. The Sarkars were divided into Parganas.
The village was the smallest unit of
administration. At the level of Sarkar, there were
two important functionaries, the faujdar and the
Amalguzar. The Faujdar was appointed by the
imperial order. Sometimes within a Sarkar a
number of Faujdars existed. At times, their
jurisdiction spread over two Sarkars even if these
belonged to two different subas. Faujdari was
an administrative division whereas Sarkar was
a territorial and revenue division. The primary
duty of the faujdar was to safeguard the life and
property of the residents of the areas under his
Jurisdiction. He was to take care of law and order
problem in his areas and assist in the timely
collection of revenue whenever force was
required. The amalguzar or amil was the revenue
collector. His duty was to assess and supervise
the revenue collection. He was expected to
increase the land under cultivation and induce
the peasants to pay revenue willingly. He used
to maintain all accounts and send the daily
receipt and expenditure report to the provincial
Diwan.
<br>
<br>
At the level of Pragana, the Shiqdar was the
executive officer. He assisted the amils in the task
of revenue collection. The amils looked after the
revenue collection at the Pargana level. The
quanungo kept all the records of land in the
pargana. The Kotwals were appointed mainly
in towns by the imperial government and were
incharge of law and order. He was to maintain
a register for keeping records of people coming
and going out of the towns. The Muqaddam was
the village head man and the Patwari looked after
the village revenue records. The services of the
Zamindars were utilized for the maintenance of
law and order in their areas as well as in the
collection of revenue. The forts were placed
under an officer called Qiladar. He was incharge
of the general administration of the fort and the
areas assigned in Jagir to him. The port
administration was independent of the
provincial authority. The governor of the port
was called Mutasaddi who was directly
appointed by the Emperor. The Mutasaddi
collected taxes on merchandise and maintained
a customhouse. He also supervised the mint
house at the port.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MILITARY SYSTEM</i></strong></div>

The Mughal emperors maintained a large
and efficient army till the reign of Aurangzeb.The
credit of organising the Mughal nobility and
army systematically goes to Akbar. The steelframe of Akbar's military policy was the
mansabdari system. Through it he set up a
bureaucracy which was half-civil and
halfmilitary in character.
The word mansab means a place or position.
The mansab awarded to an individual fixed both
his status in the official hierarchy and also his
salary. It also fixed the number of armed
retainers the holders of mansab was to maintain.
The system was formulated to streamline rank
of the nobles, fix their salary and specify the
number of cavalry to be maintained by them.
Under the mansab system ranks were expressed
in numerical terms. Abul Fazl states that Akbar
had established 66 grades of Mansabdars ranging
from commanders of 10 horsemen to 10,000
horsemen, although only 33 grades have been
mentioned by him.Initially a single number
represented the rank, personal pay and the size
of the contingent of the mansabdar. Later the
rank of mansabdar came to be denoted by two
numbers - Zat and-Sawar. The Zat denoted
personal rank of an official and the Sawar
indicated the size of contingents maintained by
the mansabdars. Depending on the strength of
contingent Mansabdars were placed in three
categories. Let us take the example of a
mansabdar who had a rank of 7000 zat and
7000 sawar (7000/7000). In the first Zat and
Sawar ranks were equal (7000/7000). In the
second, Sawar rank was lower than the Zat but
stopped at half, or fifty percent, of the Zat rank
(7000/4000). In the third, Sawar rank was lower
than fifty percent of the Zat rank (7000/3000).
Thus the Sawar rank was either equal or less
than the Zat. Even if the Sawar rank was higher,
the mansabdar's position in the official hierarchy
would not be affected. It will be decided by the
Zat rank.For example, a mansabdar with 4000
Zat and 2000 Sawar was higher in rank than a
Mansabdar of 3000 Zat and 3000 Sawar. But
there were exceptions to this rule particularly
when the mansabdar was serving in a difficult
terrian amidst the rebels. In such cases the state
often increased the Sawar rank without altering
the Zat rank. Some times Sawar rank was also
increased for a temporary period to meet
emergency situations.
<br>
<br>
Jahangir introduced a new provision in the
Sawar rank. According to it a part of Sawar rank
was termed du-aspa sih-aspa in case of select
mansabdars. For this part additional payment
at the same rate 8,000 dams per Sawar was
sanctioned. Thus if the Sawar rank was 4000
out of which 1000 was du-aspa sih-aspa, salary
for this Sawar was calculated as 3,000 × 8,000 +
(1,000 × 8,000' × 2) = 40,000,000 dams.Without
du-aspa sih-aspa, salary for the 4,000 Sawar
would have stood at (4,000 × 8,000) = 32,000,000
dams. Thus the mansabdar was to maintain
double number of Sawars for the du-aspa sihaspa category and was paid for it. Jahangir
probably introduced this provision to promote
nobles of his confidence and strengthen them
militarily. By this provision he could increase the
military strength of his nobles without effecting
any change in their Zat rank. Any increase in
their Zat rank would not only have led to
jealously among other nobles but also an
additional burden on the treasury.
Shahjahan introduced the month-scale in
the, mansabdari system to compensate the gap
between Jama (estimated income) and hasil
(actual realisation).The mansabaars were
generally paid through revenue assignments
Jagirs. The biggest problem was that calculation
was made on the basis of the expected income
(Jama) from the Jagir during one year. It was
noticed that the actual revenue collection (hasil)
always fell short of the estimated income. In such
a situation, the mansabdar's salary was fixed by
a method called monthscale. Thus, if a Jagir
yielded only half of the Jama, it was called
Shashmaha (six monthly), if it yielded only one
fourth, it was called Sihmaha (three monthly).
The month scale was applied to cash salaries
also. There were deductions from the sanctioned
pay also. During the reign of Shahjahan the
mansabdars were allowed to maintain 1/5 to
1/3 of the sanctioned strength of the Sawar rank
without any accompanying reduction in their
claim on the maintenance amount for the Sawar
rank.
<br>
<br>
Aurangzeb continued with all these changes
and created an additional rank called Mashrut
(conditional). This was an attempt to increase
the sawar rank of the mansabdar temporarily.
Aurangzeb added one another deduction called
Khurakidawwab, towards meeting the cost for
feed of animals in the imperial stables.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JAGIRDARI SYSTEM</i></strong></div>

The system of assignment of revenue of a
particular territory to the nobles for their services
to the state continued under the Mughals also.
Under the Mughals, the areas assigned were
generally called Jagir and its holders Jagirdars.
The Jagirdari system was an integral part of the
mansabdari system which developed under
Akbar and underwent certain changes during
the reign of his successors. During Akbar's period
all the territory wasbroadly divided into two:
Khalisa and Jagir. The revenue from the first
went to imperial treasury, and that from Jagir
was assigned to Jagirdars in lieu of their cash
salary. Salary entitlements of mansabdars were
calculated on the basis of their Zat and Sawar
ranks. The salary was paid either in cash (in that
case they were called Naqdi) or through the
assignment of a Jagir, the latter being the
preferable mode. In case the payment was made
through the assignment of a Jagir, the office of
the central Diwan would identify parganas the
sum total of whose Jama was equal to the salary
claim of the mansabdars. In case the recorded
Jama was in excess of salary claim the assignee
was required to deposit the balance with the
central treasury. On the other hand, if it was
less than the salary claim the short fall was paid
from the treasury.
<br>
<br>
However, none of the assignments was
permanent or hereditary. The Emperor could
shift part or the entire Jagir from one part of the
imperial territory to another at any time. The
ratio between Jagir and Khalisa kept fluctuating
during the Mughal rule. During Akbar's period
Khalisa was only 5% of total revenue, under
Jahangir it was 10%, under Shahjahan it
fluctuated between 9 to 15%. In the latter part
of Aurangzeb's reign there was a great pressure
on the Khalisa as the number of claimants for
Jagir increased with the increase in the number
of mansabdars. The jagirdars were also
transferred from one Jagir to another (but in
certain cases they were allowed to keep their Jagir
in one locality for longer period of time). The
system of transfer checked the Jagirdars from
developing local roots. At the same time, its
disadvantage was that it discouraged the
Jagirdars from taking long term measures for the
development of their areas.
There were various types of Jagirs. Tankha
Jagirs were given in lieu of salaries, Mashrut
Jagirs were given on certain conditions, and
Watan Jagirs were assigned to Zamindar or rajas
in their local dominions. Altamgha Jagirs were
given to Muslim nobles in their family towns or
place of birth. Tankha Jagirs were transferable
every three to four years. Watan Jagirs were
hereditary and non transferable. When a
Zamindar was made a mansabdar, he was given
Tankha Jagir apart from his watan Jagir at
another place, if the salary of his rank was more
than the income from his watan Jagir.
The Jagirdars were allowed to collect only
authorized revenue in accordance with the
imperial regulations. The jagirdars employed
their own officials like amil etc.The imperial
office kept watch on the Jagirdars. The Diwan
of the suba was supposed to prevent the
oppression of the peasants by the Jagirdars. Amin
was posted in each suba to see that Jagirdars
were following imperial regulations. Faujdar
used to help the Jagirdas if they faced any
difficulty in the collection of revenue.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RELIGION-DIN-ILLAHI</i></strong></div>

The Mughal rulers except Aurangazeb
adopted a tolerant religious policy. Practically
all-religious communities existed in India during
the Mughal period. The Hindus, the Muslim, the
Christians, the Buddhist, Sikhs, the Parsis and
the Jains were the prominent religious
communities among them. The Hindu
constituted majority among the population while
the ruling class belonged to the Muslims.
Shershah, the forerunners of Akbar adopted a
policy to religious toleration. Akbar was,
however, the finest among the monarchs of
medieval India who raised the policy of religious
toleration to the Pinnacle of secularism. The socio
political condition of the country was such that
Akbar thought it advisable to adopt independent
voices in religious matters. The non Muslim
constituted the majority of his Indian subjects.
Without winning their confidence and active
support Akbar could not hope to establish and
consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.
Akbar did not discriminate between his
subjects on the basis of religion. He abolished
pilgrim tax through out his dominions close upon
its heels Akbar took the most revolutionary step
in 1564, in granting religious freedom to the
Hindu; it was the abolition of Jaziya. This was a
poll tax charged from the Hindus in their
capacity as Zammis. Being a youth of courage
and conviction he wiped out the traditional
religious disability from which the Hindu
subjects of the Muslim rulers been suffering since
long. Sheik Mubarak a liberal minded scholar of
Sufi, His son Abul Faizi and Abul Fazl influence
Akber's religious policy greatly under their
influence Akbar became all the more liberal and
to grant towards people of diverse religious faith.
He removed all restrictions on the construction
and maintenance of Hindu temples, Churches
and other places of worship. In order to please
the Hindu subjects Akbar adopted their social
customs and practices, mixed freely with them
and appreciated their cultural values. Akbar
wanted to create a spirit of love and harmony
among his people by eliminating all racial,
religious and cultural barriers between.In order
to achieve this objective he ordered in 1575 the
construction of Ibadat Khana - The house of
worship at Fatehpursikri to adorn the spiritual
kingdom. He initiated the practice of holding
religious discourses there with the learned men
and the saints of the age. To begin with Akbar
used to invite only the Muslims theologians and
saints, including the ulema, sheikhs, sayyadi etc
to take part in these deliberations. But they failed
to arrive at agreed opinion on many Islamic
belief and practice and in the midst of
deliberations on very sober and tought
provocating aspects of divinity, displayed spirit
of intolerance towards each other. The rival
group of theologians drew their swords to settle
the religious issues at stake. Akbar was shocked
to witness the irresponsible behaviour of those
self conceited greedy and intolerant Mullahs.In
disgust he threw open the gates of the Ibadat
Kaham to the priest and scholars of other
religious faith including Hinduism, Jainism,
Zorastrianism and Christianity.
<br>
<br>
As a result of the religious discourses held at
the Ibadat Khance. Akbar belief in the orthodox
Sunni Islam was shaken. In 1579 a proclamation
called the Mahzar, was issued. It recognized
Akbar in his capacity as the just monarch and
amir ul momnin to be the Imam-i-Adil viz.The
supreme interpreter or arbitrator of the Islamic
law in all controversial issues pertaining to
ecclesiastical or civil matters.
After the issue of Mahzar, religious discourse
continued to be held at the Ibadat Khana.Akbar
mixed freely with Muslim dovines, Sufi saints
Hindu, mystics, and sanyasis and Jain scholars.
As a result of this Akbar came to the conclusion
that if some tree knowledge was thus
everywhere to be found, why should truth be
confined to one religious or creed like Islam
Akbar gradually turned away from Islam and
set up a new religion which was compounded
by many existing religions - Hinduism,
Christianity, Zorastrianism etc. However
modern historians are not inclined to accept this
view. The word used by Ahul Fazl for the so
called new path was Tauhid-i-Ilahi which
literally means Divine Monotheism. The word
din or Faith was not applied to it till 8 years later.
The Tauhid-i-Ilahi was really on order of the
sufistic type. Those who were willing to join and
those whom the emperor approved were
allowed to become members. Sunday was fixed
as the day for initialism.
<br>
<br>
Din Ilahi was not a new religion Akbar's real
objects was to unite the people of his empire into
an integrate national community by providing
a common religious cum spiritual platform or
the meeting ground.Din Ilahi was a
socioreligious association of like-minded
intellectuals and saints. Akbar becomes the
spiritual guide of the nation.The members of the
Din Ilahi abstained form meat as far as possible
and do not dine with or use the utensils of the
butchers, fishermen, did not marry old women
or minor girls. The members were to greet each
other with the words Allah-u- Akbar or God is
great. The number of persons who actually
joined the order was small, many of them
consisting of personal favourites of Akbar. Thus
the order was not expected to play an important
political role. The Din Ilahi virtually dies with
him. Principles of Tawahid-i-Ilahi or Din-i-Ilahi
aimed at achieving a synthesis of all religions,
Akbar's Din-i-llahi's major principles include:

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>God is great (Allah-o-Akbar)</li>
        <li>Initiations would be performed on
Sunday.</li>
        <li>The novice would place his head at the
emperor's feat. The emperor would raise
him up and give him the formula
(Shast).</li>
        <li>The initiates would abstain from meat
as far as possible and give a sumptuous
feast and alms on their birthday.</li>
        <li>There would be no sacred scriptures,
place of worship or rituals (except
initiation).</li>
        <li>Every adherent should take oath of
doing well to everybody.</li>
        <li>Followers should show respect to all
religions.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Akbar's efforts at social reform are also
noteworthy. He raised the age of marriage. He
even tried to makl education broad-based and
secular. Jahangir and Shah Jahan pursued the
same toleran policy though at times there were
aberrations. Aurangzeb was a staunch Sunni
but he was intolerant of other faith. He reversed
the policy of Akbar, and this partly led to the
decline of Mughal power after his death.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RELIGIOUS THOUGHT ABUL FAZL</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Orthodox Religious Thought</i></strong></div>

Akbar's religious experiments had no impact
on the Muslim masses among who he made no
attempt to propagate the Tauhit-i-Ilahi. A
Mulslim revivalist movement began in the closing
years of his reign under the leadership of the
Naqshbani Sufis. They supported jahangir's
accession to the throne, The Sunni orthodoxy
sponsored by them was patronised by Shah
jaha. it was also an important factor in
Aurangzeb's victory over Dara who weakened
himself politically by his efforts to revive Akbar's
eclecticism. Aurangzeb's accession heralded the
final triumph of Sunni orthodoxy.
Among the Shias there was a general belief
that the Hidden Imam, al-Mahdi, would
reappear, restore the purity of Islam, and reestablidh justic, peace and prosperity. This
expectation of the establishment of the kingdom
of God on earth was shared by the Sunnis despite
their differences with the Shias about the
succession to the Imamate (Caliphate).
From time to time bold impostors arose and
laid claim to Mahdiship. This is known as the
mahdavi movement. One such pretender,
Ruknuddin of Delhi, was put to death by Firuz
Shah Tughluq. Nearly a century later Sayyid
Muhammad of Jaunpur claimed to be the Mahdi,
incurred the displeasure of Sultan Mahmud
Shah I of Gujarat, and was banished to Mecca.
His teachings were imbibed by Mian Abdullah
Niyazi and Shaikh Alai who were suppressed
by Islam Shah Sur. The Mahdavi movement
practically fizzled out in the second half of the
sixteenth century.
<br>
<br>
Abul Fazl represented Akbar as a mujaddid
(religious reformer). According to an Apostolic
tradition a mujaddid was expected to appear
towards the end of the first millennium after the
hijra. This tradition lay behind the compilation
of an important historical work of Akbar's reign,
Tarikh-i-Alfi, which, however, was left
incomplete. Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi, a pupil of
the Naqshbandi saint Khwaja Baqi Billah, who
died in Delhi towards the close of Akbar's reign,
was known as Mujaddid alf sani (reformer of
the second millennium).


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Unorthodox Religious Thought</i></strong></div>


During the Mughal period the Chishti school
of Sufis lost ground and it produced no
outstanding saint who could reinvigorate its
teachings. Due to aloofness from politics and
administration it was also out of tune with the
prevailing political and social conditions.
The Naqshbandi school attached itself closely
to the court and the mobility and degraded
Sufism to the Status of a nandmaid of orthodox
Islam. Its programme took and aggressive form
in the nobles of the imperial court and gave wide
currency-throuth tracts and letters-to the idea
that Akabar's liberal policy had polluted the
purity of Islam and led to the political, social and
cultural degeneration of Muslims. He aimed at
purging which appeared to be un-Islamic. His
techings were not confined to the reform of Islam;
he advocated a crusade against the Hindus.
Shah Jahan was an orthodox Sunni, but his
favourite eldest son Dara was a believer in
Akbbar's eclecticism. During the latters reigh the
conflict between orthodoxy and mysticism
continued. It was resolved in favour of the
orthodox Sunni School of thought through war
of succession which saw Aurangzeb ascend the
throne. Before and after his accession to the
throne Aurangzeb maintained contact with
Khwaja Muhammad Masum, son of Shaikh
Ahmad Sirhindi. On the other hand Darda and
Jahanara were disciples of a Qadiri Sufi saint,
Mulla Shah, a persian well known for religious
tolerance.
<br>
<br>
The Qadiri school of Sufis found a foothold
in Iindia in Adbar's reign. Its principal centre
was Uch in Sind. One of the early advocates of
its teachings in India was Shaikh Abdul a wellknown theological scholar Haq of Delhi and
contemporary of Akbar, Jahangir and Shah
Jahan. Mir Muhammad, better known as main
Mir, who lived at lahore and was a highly
respected fiend of the Sikha was also a member
of this School.
Aurangzeb's religious and political ideas
were totally irreconcilable with the mysticism
and liberalism generally associated with Sufism.
he ruled according to the shariat and this
necessitated codification of its principles in a rigid
form (Fatawa-i-Alamgiri).


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Abdul Fazl's Background</i></strong></div>

The most important historical writer of the
age of the great Mughals is Abul Fazl Allami.
Born in 1550, he was murdered at the instigation
of prince Salim in 1602. his father, Shaikh
Mubarak, was a famous scholar and sufi; he
played an important role in the development of
Akbar's religious views and policy. his brother
Faizi was a poet laureate in Akbar's court. He
was himself a first-rate scholar and writer, a firm
believer in eclecticism, an able and loyal servant
of the state, a man of extraordinary industry,
and an intimate friend of Adber.
Commissioned by the Emperor to write a
history of his reign, he produced two
outstanding works. His narration of facts and
his chronology are generally accurate. But his
style, though brilliant, is too rhetorical and
involved to made a direct appeal to the reader.
It is also marked by the flattery of his patron
whom he considered a superman. On the whole,
Abul Fazl connot be regarded as a fully objective
and impartial historian.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>His Writings and Historiography</i></strong></div>


Abul Fazl's Akbarnama is a voluminous
work. After narrating the history of the Mughal
royal family form Timur to Humayun, it deals
with the history of Akbar's reign, year by year,
down to 1602. It explains the reasons behind the
measures taken by the Emperor and covers every
aspect of the history of the period. Inayatullah's
Takmil-i-Akbarnama is a cotinuation of Abul
Fazl's work carrying down the narrative to


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Akbar's death.</i></strong></div>


Abul Fazl's Ain-i-Akbari is the principal
source for Akbar's administratice institution. It
deals primarily with Akbar's regulations in all
departments and on all subjects and includes,
besides some extraneous matter, a valuable and
minute statistical account of his empire with
historical and other notes.
There is a collection of Abul Fazl's letters
(Ruqqat-i-Fazl) to akbar and members of the
imperial family. This collection has been useful
in throwing light on several historical events.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMY</i></strong></div>

<b>Khudkashta :</b> Those peasants living in their
own villages, owning their own lands and
implements. Two obligations to the statepayment of revenue regularly and cultivation of
his land. Some of them rented out their spare
lands and implements to the other two
categories. They were called mirasdars in
Maharashtra and gharuhala or gaveti in
Rajasthan. Their economic and social superiority
over the other two categories of peasants.
Economic superiority since they paid only the
customary revenue to the state and not any other
tax as was paid by the other two categories.
Social superiority due to their land ownership
rights, and being the core of the village
community.
<br>
<br>
<b>Pahis :</b> Those who were basically outsiders
but cultivated the rented lands in a village either
while staying in the neighbouring village or by
staying in the same village. Their division into
two groups: non-residential pahis and residential
pahis. The former came from the neighbouring
villages and cultivated the rented lands without
constructing residences in that village. The latter
came from the far-off vllages and cultivated the
rented lands by constructing the residences in
the village. The residential pahis could transform
themselves into khudkashta, if they had their
own implements, possession of implements being
more important than that of lands, which were
in abundance. They were known as uparis in
Maharashtra.
<br>
<br>
<b>Muzariyams :</b> Those who belonged to the
same village, but who did not have either lands
or implements and hence wee heavily dependent
on the khudkashta for their supply. Their
division two groups; tenants-at-will and those
who had hereditary tenant rights. They formed
the poorest section of the peasantry and can be
compared with the share croppers of the later
period.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CONDITION OF ZAMINDARS</i></strong></div>

<b>Autonomous Zamindars :</b> They were the
hereditary rulers of their respective territories.
Economically and militarily they formed a
formidable class. They could be divided into
three groups on the basis of the overlordship of
the Mughals over them- those who joined
Mughal imperial over them- those who joined
Mughal imperial service and were granted
mansabs and jagirs; those who did not join
Mughal service and hence were not given
mansabs and jagirs, but had the obligations of
rendering military service to the Mughals when
called upon to do so; and those who never
rendered military service but paid tributes and
personal homage to the Mughals. The Mughals
normally did not interfere in the internal affairs
of these autonomous zamindars.
<br>
<br>
<b>Intermediary Zamindars :</b> Those who had
ownership rights over his personal lands but had
only zamindari rights, i.e., hereditary right to
collect revenue from the peasants for the state,
over a wider area. For this service to the state,
they were entitled for a portion of the surplus
produce. They formed the back-bone of Mughal
revenue administration.
<br>
<br>
<b>Primary Zamindars :</b> Those who had
ownership rights over his personal lands and
zamindari rights over his zamindari, butdid not
perform the hereditary function of collecting
revenue for the state. He got only his malikana
or customary share of the surplus produce, but
not the nankar or additional share of the surplus
produce, which he could have got if he had
performed his hereditary function.
<br>
<br>
Thus, the rights of the zamindars co-existed
with those of the state and the actual producer.
The economic condition of the zamindars as a
class was much better than that of the peasantry.
Bigger zamindars led as ostentatious a life as the
nobles, but the smaller zamindars lived more or
less like the peasantry.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>STATE OF AGRICULTURE</i></strong></div>

<b>Main Crops :</b> Foreign travellers' accounts as
well as the Ain-i-Akbari show that cereals,
millets, oil-seeds, sugarcane, cotton, hemp,
indigo, poppies and betel were grown
extensively. Ajmer sugarcane was perhaps the
best in quality in the 16th century. European
demand resulted in a tremendous increase in
indigo production in India, centered in Sarkhij
(Gujarat) and Bayana (near Agra). Tobacco,
which was brought to the Mughal court from
Bijapur during Akbar's reign and the smoking
of which was prohibited by Jahangir, became a
very valuable crop and was extensively
cultivated. Chilli as well as potato were
introduced in India by the Portuguese, while
Babur brought many Central Asian fruits with
him.
<br>
<br>
<b>Irrigation :</b> During Akbar's reign, Firoz
Shah's Yamuna canal was repaired for the first
time. Under Shah Jahan it was reopened from
its mouth at Khizrabad to serve Delhi and came
to be known as the Nahr-i-Bihisht (Channel of
Heaven). It was also used for irrigation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Slow Growth :</b> Agriculture was carried on
in the same way as in the ancient times, there
being little change in the methods of cultivation
and agricultural implements. Despite the
expansion in the area under cultivation, the
growth in agricultural production was quite
slow, i.e., it was not able to keep in pace with
the growth in the needs of the people as well
the state.
<br>
<br>
<b>Causes :</b> This slow growth or near stagnation
in agricultural production (in comparison with
the rapidly increasing requirements of the time)
was due to certain factors- lack of new methods
of cultivation to counter the trend of declining
productivity of the soil; increased amount of land
revenue; the attempts of the zamindars and the
upper caste and rich peasants to prevent the
lower castes and the rural poor from settling new
villages and thus acquiring proprietary rights in
land; the jajmani system, a reciprocal system that
existed in rural India, encouraged production
mainly meant for local consumption and not for
the market.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GROWTH IN TRADE</i></strong></div>


<b>Urbanisation :</b> The Mughals, forming the
main part of the ruling class and being outsiders,
found it convenient to settle down in towns and
cities, rather than in villages where they would
be treated as aliens. Unlike the British of the later
period, they made India their home and spent
all their income in India itself particularly in the
towns and cities, by encouraging handicrafts, art
and architecture, literature, and the like.
<br>
<br>
<b>Traders and Merchants :</b> Economically and
professionally, this was a highly stratified class.
Economically, they could be divided into big
business magnates owning hundreds of ships,
rich merchants and traders of towns, and petty
shopkeepers. Professional specialisation was
prevalent in the form of wholesale traders, retail
traders, banjaras or those specialised in the
carrying trade, shroffs or those specialised in
banking, etc. The shroffs developed the
institution of hundis or bills of exchange. Big and
rich merchants lived in an ostentatious manner
and aped the manners of the nobles. But small
merchants lived a simple life.
<br>
<br>
Though European novelties were very
popular with the Mughal aristocracy, the same
cannot be said about their mechanical
inventions. But what is interesting is the request
made by Bhimji Parikh, a broker of the English
East India Company, for a printing press possibly
to print his bills. Though a printer was
accordingly sent in 1671, the experiment was not
a success and no further information on Parikh's
pioneering efforts at printing in India are
available.
<br>
<br>
<b>Others :</b> The class of officials ranged from
big mansabdars to ordinary soldiers and clerks.
Other urban groups or classes included those of
the artisans, handicraftsmen, teachers and
doctors.
Causes for Growth of Trade
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Political and economic unification of the
country under Mughal rule and the
establishment of law and order over
extensive area.</li>
        <li>Improvement of transport and
communications by the Mughals.</li>
        <li>Encouragement given by the Mughals to
the monetisation of the economy or the
growth of money economy.</li>
        <li>Arrival of the European traders from the
beginning of the 17th century onwards
and the growth of European trade.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COINS OF SURS AND MUGHALS</i></strong></div>

<b>Sur Coinage :</b> Sher Shah was ruler of great
constructive and administrative ability, and the
reform of the coinage, though completed by
Akbar, was in a great measure due to his genius.
His innovations lay chiefly in two directions :
first, the introduction of a new standard of 178
grains for silver, and one of about 330 grains for
copper, with its half, quarter, eighth and
sixteenth parts. These two new coins were
subsequently known as the rupee and the dam.
The second innovation saw a large increase in
the number of the mints: at least twenty three
mint names appear on the Sur coins. Genuine
gold coins of the Sur kings are exceedingly rare.
The rupees are fin broad pieces; the obverse
follows the style of Humayun's silver; the reverse
bears the Sultan's name in Hindi, often very
faulty. In the margin are inscribed the special
titles of the Sultan, and sometimes the mint. On
a large number of both silver and copper coins
no mint name occurs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mughal Coinage</i></strong></div>

The importance attached to the currency by
the Mughal emperors is revealed in the accounts
given by Akbar's minister, Abul Fazl, in the Aini-Akbari, and by Jahangir in his memoirs, the
Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, and by the number of
references to the subject by historians throughout
the whole period. From these and from a study
of the coins themselves scholars have collected a
mass of materials, from which it is now possible
to give a fairly comprehensive account of the
Mughal coinage.
<br>
<br>
Abul Fazl and Jahangir mention a large
number of gold and silver coins, varying from
2,000 tolahs to a few grains in weight. Gigantic
pieces are also mentioned by Manucci, Hawkins
and others; and Manucci says that Shah Jahan
'gave them as presents to the ladies'. They were
also at times presented to ambassadors, and
appear to have been merely used as a convenient
form in which to store treasure.
<br>
<br>
<b>Types of Coins :</b> The standard gold coin of
the Mughals was the muhar, of about 170 to 175
grains, the equivalent of nine rupees in Abul
Fazl's time. Half and quarter muhars are known
to have been issued by several emperors, and a
very few smaller pieces, also.
The rupee, adopted from Sher Shah's
currency, is the most famous of all Mughal coins.
The name occurs only once, on a rupee of Agra
minted in Akbar's forty-seventh regnal year.
Halves, quarters, eighths and sixteenths were
also struck. In Surat the half rupee appears to
have been in special demand.
In addition to the regular gold and silver
currency, special small pieces were occasionally
struck for largess; the commonest of these is the
nisar, struck in silver by Jahangir, Shah Jahan
and Aurangzeb. Jahangir also issued similar
pieces, which he called nur afshan and khair
qabul.
<br>
<br>
The Mughal copper coinage is based on Sher
Shah's dam which with its half, quarter and
eighth, continued to be struck until the fifth year
of Aurangzeb. The name dam occurs only once
on a half dam of Akbar. The usual term employed
is fulus (copper money) or sikkah fulus (stamped
copper money). The name nisfi (half dam),
damra (quarter dam), damri (one eighth of a
dam) also appear on Akbar's copper.
Main features : Perhaps the most distinctive
feature of the Mughal coinage is the diversity of
mints. Akbar's known mints number seventy six.
Copper was struck in fifty nine of these, the
largest number recorded for any emperor, while
silver is known from thirty nine. Aurangzeb's
conquests in the Deccan raised the silver mints
to seventy, whereas copper mints sank to twenty
four.
Such was the coinage of the Great Mughals.
Considering it as the output of a single dynasty,
which maintained the high standard and purity
of its gold and silver for three hundred years,
considering also its variety, the number of its
mints, the artistic merit of some of its series, the
influence it exerted on contemporary and
subsequent coinages, and the importance of its
standard coin-the rupee- in the commerce of
today, the Mughal currency surely deserves to
rank as one of the great coinages of the world.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MUGHAL ART</i></strong></div>

The Mughal emperors were great builders
and they constructed many noble edifices and
monuments. The Indo-Muslim style of
architecture gained remarkable progress. Babar
himself was a patron of art, even though he had
a poor opinion of Indian artists and craftsmen.
Agra was rebuilt and beautified and gardens
were laid out. Humayun had little time to engage
himself in artistic activities; but a mosque of his
is still seen in Punjab decorated in Persian style.
In the reign of Akbar, Mughal architecture
reached a high level of perfection.The emperor
took keen interest in buildings. In the words of
Abul Fazl, "He planned splendid edifices and
dressed the works of his mind and heart in
garments of stone and clay". He favoured both
the Hindu and Persian styles of architecture.At
the same time; he borrowed artistic ideas from a
variety of sources and applied them in the
construction of his edifices and monuments. It
may also be noted that, unlike Shah Jahan who
had an attraction for white marble for the
construction of his buildings, Akbar preferred
red sandstone.
<br>
<br>
The tomb of Humayun at Delhi is one of the
earliest of Akbar's buildings. It was designed after
Timur's tomb at Samarkhand and represented a
striking departure from the traditional Indian
style. It was surrounded by a large geometrical
garden and enclosed by a high wall.The Red Fort
at Agra which contained as many as 500
buildings of red sandstone was another
outstanding achievement of Akbar in the field
of architecture. The Jahangiri Mahal and Akbari
Mahal located within the Agra Fort were
designed and built by Indian craftsmen who
were experts in the construction of Hindu
temples and Buddhist Viharas.
The greatest achievement of Akbar as a
builder was the city of Fatehpur Sikri. Sr. Smith
has observed that "nothing like Fatehpur Sikri
ever was created or can be created again".He
calls it a "romance in stone", while Fergusson
finds in it "the reflex of the mind of a great
man".The city of Fatehpur Sikri is a cluster of
religious edifices and residential mansions built
mainly of red sandstone.The Jam-i-Masjid built
after the model of the mosque at Mecca is
considered to be the glory of Fatehpur Sikri and
is one of the largest mosques in India.The Buland
Darwaza which is 176 ft. high is a landmark of
the city. It is the highest gateway in India and
one of the biggest of its kind in the world. The
tomb of the Sufi saint Shaik Salim Chishti
specially built of white marble is another star
attraction at Fatehpur Sikri.It contains carvings
noted for "the richness and delicacy of
details".The house of Birbal, a double-storeyed
building which has been lavishly decorated,
combines within itself the best features of the
Hindu and Muslim style of architecture. The
Diwan-i-Khas which accommodated Akbar's
household has an architectural beauty of its own.
Its ornamental work is exceedingly delicate.The
Diwan-i-Am is also a richly carved edifice.Akbar
used to sit in its balcony whenever he held his
Durbar.In addition to the buildings mentioned
above, there are other important buildings also
at Fatehpur Sikri, viz., the, Panch Mahal, the
house of Mariam, Turkey Sultan's building, Hathi
Pole (the Elephant Gate), Hiran Minar, etc.
Jahangir who was more interested in fine arts
and gardening did not take much interest in
buildings.Still his reign is noted for two
remarkable edifices, viz., Akbar's tomb at
Sikandra and the tomb of Itimad-ud-daulah, the
father of Nurjahan, at Agra.The former building
shows a combination of Hindu and Muslim
styles while the latter is the first full edifice built
entirely of white marble in the Mughal period.
The reign of Shah Jahan was the Golden Age
of Mughal architecture. It may be noted at the
outset that his architecture is different from that
of Akbar in some of its features. He preferred
white marble to red sandstone which was
favoured by Akbar.Percy Brown even calls Shah
Jahan's reign "a reign of marble". His buildings
have some of the finest inlay work in the world.
The carvings are richer and more delicate.
Though both Hindu and Muslim styles continued
to influence the artist there is much less evidence
of mixture of the two styles in the architectural
works of Shah Jahan than in those of Akbar or
Jahangir. One of the earliest architectural works
of Shah Jahan was the Red Fort which he built
in the new city of Shajahanabad near Delhi.It
was modeled after the Agra Fort and contained
50 palaces, the most notable among them being
the Moti Mahal, Sheesh Mahal and Rang Mahal.
The Juma Masjid at Delhi and the Moti Masjid
at Agra are massive structure noted for the
architectural grandeur. The former was built by
Shah Jahan for the ceremonial attendance of
himself and the members of his court.
The Moti Masjid was built by the emperor in
honour of his daughter Jahanara and is one of
the most beautiful mosques in the world.Shah
Jahan also built at Lahore certain buildings like
the tombs of Jahangir, Nur Jahan, and Ali
Mardan Khan and they are also typical examples
of Mughal architecture.
<br>
<br>
The most outstanding of Shah Jahan's edifices
is the world famous Taj Mahal built by him at
Agra as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz
Mahal.Built of pure white marble it has won
praise from all quarters.It has been variously
described by art critics as a "dream in marble
designed by Titans and finished by jewelers", "a
white gleaming tear drop on the brow of time"
and "India's noblest tribute to the grace of Indian
womanhood". The Taj is supposed to have been
built at enormous cost spread over a period of
22 years. A unique feature of the building is that
its colour changes in the course of the day and
in moonlight. An admirer of the Taj even said of
it that "it is Mumtaz Mahal herself, radiant in
her youthful beauty, who lingers on the banks
of the Jamuna in the early morn, in the glowing
mid-day sun or in the silver moonlight".The Taj
has survived to this day as the king of all
buildings in India and the most splendid
monument of conjugal love and fidelity in the
world.
<br>
<br>
With the accession of Aurangzeb the Mughal
style of architecture declined. The emperor, being
economy-minded, built only very little. The best
of his buildings was the Badshahi mosque at
Lahore which was completed in 1764. Though
not of much architectural value, it is noted for
its great size and sound construction. Aurengzeb
also built a mosque with lofty minarets on the
site of the Viswanatha temple at Benares and
another one at Mathura at the site of the Kesava
Deva temple.His own tomb which he built at
Aurangabad is also a notable specimen of
Mughal architecture.
<br>
<br>
Painting had made tremendous progress in
India prior to the coming of the Turks in India
and as Hinduism and Buddhism spread over
apart of Asia, it penetrated in other countries
through them and influenced the art of painting
there.
But during the period of the Delhi Sultanate
it practically vanished in larger parts of India
because the Turk and Afghan rulers prohibited
it in deference to the direction of Koran. But, the
Mughal emperors revived this art and once again
it reached the stage of perfection.
The Mughal school of painting represents one
of the most significant phases of Indian art. In
fact, the school developed as a result of happy
blending of Persian and Indian painting both of
which had made remarkable progress
independently of each other.
Babur and Humayun came in contact with
Persian art and tried to introduce it in
India.Babur and Humayun did not accept the
prohibition of Islam concerning the art of
painting. When Humayun got shelter in Persia,
he came in contact with two disciples of the
famous Persian painter Bihzed namely Abdul
Samad and Mir Sayyid. He invited them to come
to him. Both of them joined him when he
reached Kabul and came to India along with
him. Humayun and Akbar took lessons in
painting from Abdul Samed. But, it was just the
beginning.
<br>
<br>
When Akbar became the emperor, he
encouraged painters at his court and helped in
the growth of this art. He established separate
department of painting under Abdul Samad and
ordered to prepare painting not only on the
books which was the usual practice so far but
also to prepare frescoes on palace-wall in
Fatehpur Sikri. He invited renowned painter from
China and Persia, employed the best talents of
the country at his court, assigned them work
according to their individual taste and aptitude
and provided them all facilities to make use of
their capabilities. These facilities provided by
Akbar helped hundred of artists to grow and
mature their art, resulted in the reparation of
thousands for painting and in the formation of
that school of painting which we now call the
Mughal school of painting. There were atleast
one hundred good painters at his court among
whom seventeen were prominently recognised
by the emperor. Many of them were Persian but,
a number of them were Hindus. Abdul Samad,
Farrukh Beg, Jamshed, Daswant, Basawan,
Sanwalds, Tarachand, Jagannath, Lal Mukand,
Harivansh etc. were among the most prominent
painters at his court. Thus, the credit of origin of
the mughal school of painting goes to Akbar. He
also the way of its growth.
Jahangir was not only interested in painting
but was also its keen judge. Mughal painting
marked the zenith of its rise during the perod of
his rule. Jahangir established a gallery of painting
in hos own garden. Surely, there must have been
other galleries as well in other palaces.
The cause of the progress of painting during
the reign of Jahangir was not only this that he
was interested in it and patronized artists at his
court because he himself possessed knowledge
of that art. he wrote in his biography, Tuzuk-iJahangire : As regards myself, my liking for
painting and my practice in judging it have
arrived at such a point that when any work is
brought before me, either of deceased artist or
of those of the present day, without the names
being told to me, I can say at spur there be a
picture containng many portraits and each face
be the work of a different master, I can discover
which face is the work of each of them. If any
peson has put in the eye and eyebrow of a face,
I can perceive whose work is the original face
and who has painted the eye and eyebrows.
We may regard this statement of Jahangir as
an exaggeration, yet we have to accept that the
emperor was not only interested in painting but
also a good judge of the art. Jahangir attracted
many artists at his court. He also got completed
the works taken up by the artists during the lifetime of his father.
He rewarded the artists well. Abul Hasan
was given the title of Nadir-u-Zaman while
Mansur was titled Nadir-u-Asar. Besides, from
his prominent court artists were Aga Raza,
Muhammad Nadir, Muhammad Murad, Bishan
Das, Manohar, Madhav, Tulsi and Govardhan.
Shah Jahan was more interested in
architecture than painting. Yet, he provided
patronage to painting. The art of colourcombination and portrait suffered but the art of
designing and pencil drawing developed during
the period of his rule. But, the number of painters
reduced at his court and therefore the art
certainly declined during his rule. Among the
renowned painters at his court were Fakir Ullah,
Mir Hasim, Anup, Chittra, etc.
<br>
<br>
Aurangzeb withdrew the royal patronage
which was given to the artists. He turned them
out of his court and even destroyed certain
paintings because the practice of this of this art
was prohibited by Islam. The art of painting, thus
suffered at the court of this mughal. But it
brought out some advantages indirectly. The
painters dismissed from the emperor's court
found shelter in the courts of different Hindu
and Muslim provincial rulers. It resulted in the
growth of different regional schools of art and
brought this art closer to the people.
Among the Later Mughal emperors, a few
tried to encourage painting but they lacked
sufficient resources. Thus, the mughal school of
painting received a serious setback after the rule
of Shah Jahan and continued to deteriorate
afterwards. During the later part of the
eighteenth centruy it was influenced by the
European painting which harmed it further and
it lost its originality.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COURT CULTURE-MUSIC, DANCE</i></strong></div>

The Mughals appreciated music.Babur is said
to have composed songs.Akbar was a lover of
music. His court was adorned by famous
musicians like Tansen of Gwalior and Baz
Bahadur of Malwa. Shah Jahan was fond of
vocal and instrumental music. The two great
Hindu musicians of his time were Jagannath and
Janardhan Bhatta. But Aurangzeb who was a
puritan dismissed singing from his court.
However, ironically, the largest number of books
on classical music was written in his reign.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Development Of Music During The Mughal
Period</i></strong></div>

All the Mughal rulers with the exception of
Aurangzeb loved and encouraged music.
Numerous musicians, Hindu and Muslim, Indian
and foreign, adorned the court of Akbar. They
were divided into seven groups. Each one played
the music on each day of the week. The court
extended its patronage to both vocal and
instrumental music.
Tansen was perhaps the greatest musician
of the age to whom huge amount were paid as
presents and rewards by Akbar. He was
originally in the service of the Rajput king of
Rewa and belonged to the Gwalior school of
Music.
Baz Bahadur of Malwa was also a skilled
musician, who on leaving Malwa, got into the
service of Akbar.
<br>
<br>
Jahangir and Shahjahan also extended their
patronage to music. The two chief vocalists of
Shahjahan's court were Ramdas and
Mahapattar. A musician by name Jagannath so
dlighted him with his performance that the
emperor is said to have weighed him in gold and
given it to him as his fee.
Development of music received impetus in
the court of Muhammed Shah Rangila. Two
famous vocalists Sadarang & Adarang
contributed to singing. Several forms of music
developed during his reign. Music received a
death blow during the reign of Aurangzeb who
dismissed his court musicians and prohibited
singing. The reign of Md. Shah witnessed
development in the field of music. New forms of
music like Tarana, Dadra etc. emerged Sadarang
& Adarang were two famous men associated
with Khayal.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEVELOPMENT OF LITERATURE
DURING THE MUGHAL PERIOD</i></strong></div>

Literature made tremendous progress during
the period of rule of the Mughals. Both original
and translated works were produced in large
numbers. Besides, not only literature grew in
Persian, Sanskrit and Hindi languages but works
were produced in Hindi, Sanskrit, Urdu and
other regional languages as well. Persian was
made the state-language by Akbar which helped
in the growth of its literature. Besides, all Mughal
emperors, except Akbar were well-educated and
patronised laearning.
Babur was a scholar. He wrote his biography
Tuzuki-i-Babri, in Turki language and it was so
beautifully written that it was translated into
Persian thrice. He also wrote poems both in Turki
and Persian and his collection of poems Diwan
(Turki) became quite famous.
Humayun had good command over both
Turki and Persian literature. Besides, he had
sufficient knowledge of philosophy, mathematics
and astronomy. He patronized scholars of all
subjects.
<br>
<br>
Akbar himself was not educated but he
created those circumstances which helped in
the growth of literature during the perod of his
rule. gave encouragement to Persian language
and famous works of different languages like
Sanskrit, Arabic, Turki, Greek etc. were
translated into it. He established a separated
department for this purpose. Many scholars rose
to eminence under his prtronage.
Jahangir was also well-educated. He worte
his biography, Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri, himself for the
first seventeen years of his rule and got prepared
the rest of it by Mautmid Khan. Not much was
done concerning translation work but a few
original works repute were written during the
period of his rule.
Shah Jahan also gave protection to scholars.
His son Dara Shikoh was also well-educate and
arranged for the translation of many Sanskrit
texts in Persian. Aurangzeb was also a scholar
though he hated writings of verses and books
on history.
<br>
<br>
During the period of the Later Mughals,
Persian remained the court-language till the rule
of Muhammad Shah. Afterwards, it was
replaced by Urdu. Yet, good works were
prdocued by many scholars in Persian even
afterwards. Thus, Persian got the maximum
incentive to grow during the rule of the Mughals
and therefore made very good progress.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>History Writing in Persian</i></strong></div>

Largest number of good books written in
Persian were either autobiographies or books on
history. Among writings on history, HumayunNama of Gulbadan Begum, Akbarnama and
Ain-i-Akbari of Abul Fazl, Tabkat-i-Akbari of
Nizamuddin Ahmad, Tazkiratul-waqiat of
Jauhar, Tuhfa-i-Akbarshahi alias Tarikh-i-Sher
Shah of Abbas Sarwani, Tarikh-i-Alfi which
covers nearly one thousand years of history of
the Islam and was written by the combined
efforts of many scholars, Muntkhabut-Tawarikh
of Badayuni, Tarikh-i-Salatin-Afghana of
Ahmad yadgar, Tarikh-i-Humayun of Bayazid
Sultan and Akbarnama of Faizi Sarhindi were
written during the period of the rule of Akbar.
Jahangir wrote his biography, Tuzuk-iJahangire. Mautmid Khan completed it and also
wrote lkbalnama-i-Jahangire. Massara-Jahangir
of Khawja Kamgar, Makhzzan-i-Afghani of
Niamatullah; Tarikh-i-Farishta of Muhammad
Kasim Farishta and Massare-i-Rahini of Mulla
Nahvandi were also written during the period
of rule of Jahangir.
<br>
<br>
Among the famous work written during the
period of reign of Shah Jahan were
Padshahnama of Amini Qazvini,
Shahjahanama of Inayat Khan and Alam-iSaleh of Muhammad Saleh.
Aurangzeb discouraged writings of history.
Yet, a few goods works were produced during
his rule. Among them, the most famous ones
were Muntkhab-ul-Lubab, Alamgirnama of
Mirza Muhammad Kazim, Nuskha-Dilkusha of
Muhammad Saki, Fatuhat-i-Alamgiri of Iswar
Das and Khulasa-ut-Tawarikh of Sujan Rai.
Historical works were written under the
patronage of the later Mughals as well as
provincial rulers. Among the, the most reputed
were Siyarul-Mutkharin of Gulam Hussain,
Tawarikh-i-Muzaffari of Muhammad Ali and
Tawarikh-Cahar-Gulzar-i-Suzai of Harcharan
Das.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Translation</i></strong></div>

Besides original work, books in other
languages were translated into Persian. Among
the Sanskrit text, Mahabharat was translated by
the joint efforts of Naki Khan, Badayuni, Abul
Fazal, Faizi etc. Badayuni translated Ramayana
into Persian. He also started translating
Atharvaveda while it was completed by Haji
Ibrahim Sarhindi. Faizi translated Lilavati, Shah
Muhammad Sahabadi translated Rajtarangini,
Abul Fazl translated Kahilya Dimna, Faizi
translated Nal Damyanti and Maulana Sheri
translated Hari-Vansha. All these works were
translated during the period rule of Akbar.
During the reign of Shah Jahan, his eldest son,
Dara Shikoh provided incentive to this work and
got translated fifty two Upanishads, Bhagvata
Gita and yagavasistha. He himself wrote an
original treatise titled Majma-Bahreen in which
he described that Islam and Hinduism were
simply the two paths to achieve the same God.
Many texts written in Arabic, Turki and Greek
were also translated into Persian during the rule
of the mughal emperors. Bible was translated into
Persian and many commentaries on koran were
also translated in it. Aurangzeb with the help of
many Arabic texts got prepared a book of law
and justice in Persian which was titled Fatwahi-Alamgire.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Poetry</i></strong></div>

Poems in Persian were also written this
period though this type of work could not achieve
the standard of prose-writing. Humayun wrote
a few verses. Abul Fazl named fifty nine poets
at the court of Akbar. Among them Faizi, Gizali
and Urfi were quite famous.Jahangir and Nur
Jahan were also interested in poetry. Jahan Ara
daughter of Shah Jahan and Zebunnisa,
daughter of Aurangzeb were also poetesses.
The letters written by the emperors and nobles
also occupy important place in the Persian
literature of that time. Among them, letters
written by Aurangzeb, Abul Fazl, Raja Jai Singh,
Afzal Khan, Sadulla Khan etc. have been
regarded of good literary value.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Works in Hindi</i></strong></div>

By the time Mughal rule was established in
India, had development as a literary language.
But, it received no encouragement form Babur,
Humayun and Sher Shah. Yet, many good
books were written by individual efforts, Among
them Padmavata and Yugavata have been
regarded works of repute. Akbar extended his
patronage to Hindi which helped in its growth.
Besides, private initiative also patricipated in its
growth. Among the court-scholars, the
prominent ones were Raja Birbal, Raja Man
Singh, Raja Bhagwan Das, Narhari and Hari
Nath. Nand Das, Vitthal Nath, Parmanand Das,
Kumbhan Das etc. Worked independently of the
court and enriched Hindi literature.
However, the most famous scholars of Hindi
at that time were Tulsi Das and Sur Das. Tulsi
Das wrote nearly twenty-five texts, the best
among them being the Ramcharitmansa and the
Vinaypatrika. Tulsi Das had no connection with
the court. He passed his life mostly in Banaras.
The same way, tough Sur Das lived in Agra but
had no direct connection with the court of the
emperor. He was blind. Yet, he composed
hundreds of poems also occupy a prominent
place in Hindi literature.
<br>
<br>
Besides, Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khana and
Rashan also made equally good contribution
towards Hindi-literature by their writings.
Abdur Rahim wrote hundreds of verses hwile
Rashkahn wrote many love-poems dedicated to
Lord Krishna and also a text titled Prem-Vatika.
Thus, the period of the rule of Akbar was
certainly the golden period of Hindi literature.
Jahangir and Shah Jahan also gave
recoginition to scholars of Hindi. The Younger
brother of Jahangir used to write poems in Hindi
and Jahangir extended his patronage to many
scholoars of Hindi like Buta, Raja Suraj Singsh,
Jadrup Gosai, Raja Bishan Das and Rai Manohar
Lal.
<br>
<br>
Shah Jahan also patronised many scholars
of Hindi at his court. Sundar Kavi Rai who wrote
Sundar-Srangar, Senapati, author of Kavita
Ratnakar, Kavindera Acharya who wrote his
poem Kavindra Kalpataru in Avadhi mixed with
Braj-Bhasa, Siromani Misra, Banarsi Das,
Bhusan, Mati Rai, Vedang Rai, Hari Nath etc.
were at his courts. Many other scholars of Hindi
flourished outside the court as well. Kavi Deva,
Dadu who started a new religious sect named
Dadu-Panth and Prannath who started another
religious sect named Pran-Panthi and lived at
Panna wrote many religious poems. Bihari, a
renowned poet of Hindi also wrote his couplets
during this ery time and received patronage of
Raja Jai Singh. Keshava Das, the famous poet of
Hindi lived in Orcha and wrote many texts
among which Kavi-Priya, Rasik-Priya and
Alankar-Manjari occupy important place in
Hindi literature. Aurangzeb gave no patronage
to Hindi literature. Yet, Hindi literature
continued to grow because of both private
initiative and patronage of Hindus rulers.
The Mughals did 'not have any systematic
organisation for imparting education. Some sort
of elementary education was imparted in
maktabs and pathsalas. Further it was mainly
confined to the upper sections of society and the
clergy. Most Mughal emperors were educated
and so were their ladies. Gulbadan Begum was
an accomplished lady. She wrote the Humayun
namah. Nur Jahan, Mumtaz Mahal, Jahanara
Begum and Zeb-un-Nisa were highly educated
ladies.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND
STATUS OF WOMEN</i></strong></div>

During the medieval period Indian society
was divided into two broad divisions based on
religion. In English documents and records of
the period the Hindus are referred to as 'Gentoos'
(Gentiles) and the Muslims as 'Moors'. The two
communities differed with respect to social
manners and etiquette; even their forms of
salutation festivals. The social rites and
ceremonies of the two communities, on occasions
of birth and marriage, for instance, were
different. Although these differences
occasionally provoked tension and even hostility,
a system of peaceful coexistence developed and
even fraternizing on social occasions and in fairs
was not uncommon.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MUSLIM SOCIETY</i></strong></div>

 As a result of continuous immigration from
the Muslim countries of central and West Asia
the Muslim population retained the mixed
character which it had acquired during the
previous centuries. In the north-western region
the central Asians and Persians, who entered
India during the reigns of Babur and his
successors, Lived side by side with the Muslim
immigrants of the pre-Mughal period. In coastal
regions the immigrants were primarily traders,
hailing originally form Arabia and the Persian
Gulf. As a result of their regular or irregular
unions with the local Hindus or converts a
number of Muslim communities of mixed origin
had come into existence, e.g., the Navayats of
western India, the Mappillas or Moplabar, and
the Labbais of the Coromandel cost. There were
also a considerable number of Muslims of
Abyssinian origin, most of whose ancestors were
originally imported as slaves. As large parts of
Afghanistan formed an integral part of the
Mughal Empire, Afghans living in India could
hardly be placed in the category of immigrants.
Muslims of foreign origin, formally united by
Islam, had racial and religious differences which
influenced politics and society. The Turanis
(Central Asians) and the Afghans were Sunnis;
the Persians (Iranians) were Shias. There was
much rivalry for political prominence and social
promotion among these Muslims of diverse
origins. however, Muslims of foreign origin
considered as a distinct group, constituted the
principal element in the ruling class of the
Mughal period. They claimed superiority to the
Hindustani Muslims, i.e., Hindu converts and
their descendants on the basis of birth, race and
culture.
<br>
<br>
The overwhelming majority of the Muslims
were descendants of hindu converts; but there
was a tendency on their part to claim foreign
descent with a view to securing political and
social advantages. They were generally looked
down upon by bonafide Turanians and Iranians;
but they were received on equal terms in mosques
during the Friday prayers and also on occasions
of principal religious festivals. There was no bar
to inter-marriage on racial on racial grounds. A
Muslim of low birth could rise to a high rank in
the nobility by dint of ability of through the
favour of fortune. The Muslim society had far
greater internal mobility than the Hindu society.
Apart form racial and religious differences,
i.e., Shia-Sunni disputes, there were clear-cut
social differences within the Muslim society.
Three classes are mentioned in a sixteenthcentury Persian work: (a) the ruling class
comprising the imperial family, the nobility and
the army; (b) the intelligentsia, comprising
theologians (ulema0, judges (qazis), men of
learning and men of letters; © the class catering
to pleasures, comprising classification is
obviously incomplete and unsatisfactory. For
example, it does not make a not of the producing
classes-the peasants and the artisans-who
farmed the backbone of state and society, and
the lower ranks of the official bureaucracy of the
minor officials.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HINDU SOCIETY</i></strong></div>

Hindu society in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries was characterised by
conflicting trends of liberalism and catholicity
on the one hand and exclusiveness and
conservatism on the other.
Some of the Vaishnava and Tantric teachers
recognized, to some extent, the religious and
social rights of women as also of the Sudras. some
non-Brahmin followers of Chaitanya become
spiritual perceptors (gurus) not only of the three
lower castes but also of Brahmins. In
Maharashtra Tukaram, a Sudra, and in the
Brahmins. villey Sankardev and Madhavdev,
who were Kayasthas, had Brahmin disciples.
But the Brahmin authors of the nibandhas
tried to maintain the integrity of the ancient
socio- religious system (Varnasrama dharma) by
regulatin the life and conduct of all classes of
Hindus in the minutest details in conformity with
traditional caste rules. Some writters of the Smriti
nibandhas had royal patrns and their injuction
carred political sanction. One of them, Keshava
Pandit, was judge under the Maratha King
Sambhaji.
<br>
<br>
But there were eminent authors like
Raghunandan and Ramnath of Bengal. Pitambar
of Kamrup and Kamalakar Bhatta of
Maharashtra whose authority was accepted by
the Hindu society even though it was accepted
by the Hindu society even though it was not
backed by royal patronage. their influence
effectively counteracted the liberal trends. The
raised their voice against the usurping of the
privileges of the Brahmins by the lower castes.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>POSITION OF WOMEN</i></strong></div>

<b>Purdah System:</b> With the advent of Islam,
new forces appeared on the Indian horizon. strict
veiling of women was the common practice
among the Muslim in their native land. Naturally
in a foreign country like India, greater stress was
laid upon it. The Hindus adopted purdah as a
protective measure. The tendency to imitate the
ruling class was another factor which operated
in favour of introducing purdah among the
Hindu families. Seclusion thus became a sign of
respect and was strictly observed among the
high-class families of both communities. Barbosa
has referred to the strict observation of purdah
by the women of Bengal. Barring some notable
Muslim families, the south Indians did not adopt
purdah. In the Vijayanagar Empire, purdah was
confined only to the members of the royal
household. No such coercive purdah system was
observed among the Hindu middle class was
observed among the Hindu middle class and
certainly not among the Hindu masses.
<br>
<br>
<b>Child Marriages:</b> The custom, in those days,
did not allow girls to remain in their parents'
home for more than six to eight years after birth.
The rigidity of the custom together with the
celebration of the marriage at a very early age
left no room whatsoever for either the bride or
bridegroom to have time to think of a partner of
their own choice. Dowry was demanded while
in some castes and localities the bride-price was
also known to be prevalent.
<br>
<br>
<b>Monogamy:</b> Monogamy seems to have been
the rule among the lower stretum of society in
both communities during the medieval period.
In spite of the decision of ulema in the Ibadat
Khana in Akbar's times, that a man might marry
any number of wives by mutah but only four by
nikah, Akbar had issued definite orders that a
man of ordinary means should not possess more
than one wife unless the first proved to be barren.
Polygamy was the privilege of the rich.
<br>
<br>
<b>Position of Widows:</b> Divorce and
remarriage, common among Muslims, were
prohibited for Hindu women. Widowremarriage, except amongst the lower caste
people, had completely disappeared in Hindu
society during the medieval age. The custom of
sati was prevalent. Even betrothed girls had to
commit sati was prevalent. Even betrothed girl
had to commit sati on the funeral pyres of their
would-be-husbands. Those widows who would
not burn themselves with their husbands were
treated harshly by society.
<br>
<br>
<b>Custom of Sati:</b> Some of the Delhi Sultans
did try to discourage the custom of sati which
prevailed among a large section of the Hindu
population, particularly the upper classes and
the Rajputs. Though sati was only voluntary in
the south and not enjoined upon widows, it is
difficult to account for its wide popularity in the
Vijayanagar Empire, whose rules do not seem
to have put up any restriction on its observance.
Muhammad Tughluq was, in all probability, the
first medieval ruler who place restrictions on its
observance. Thourgh Akbar did not forbid the
sati altogether, he had issued difinite orders to
the kotwals that they should not allow a woman
to be burnt against her inclination. Aurangzeb
was the only Mughal who issued definite orders
(1664) for bidding sati in his realm altogether.
<br>
<br>
<b>Economic Position:</b> Economically, a Muslim
woman was entitled to a share in the inheritance
with absolute right to dispose it off. Unlike her
Hindu sister, she retained the right even after
marriage. Mehr, or entente nuptial settlement,
was another safeguard for Muslim women
whereas a Hindu woman had no right to the
property of her husband's parents. A Hindu
woman was only entitled to maintenance and
residence expenses besides movable property like
ornaments, jewellery, etc. Thus, form the legal
point of view, women were reduced to a position
of dependency in every sphere of life, The
women in the south under the Cholas (8th to
13th century), however, had the right to inherit property.
