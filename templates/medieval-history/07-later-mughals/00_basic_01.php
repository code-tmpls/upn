<h3>Later Mughals</h3>

The unity and stability of the Mughal Empire
was shaken during the long and strong reign of
Emperor Aurangzeb. However, in spite of
setbacks and adverse circumstances the Mughal
administration was still quite efficient and the
Mughal army strong at the time of his death in
1707. This year is generally considered to
separate the era of the great Mughals from that
of the lesser Mughals. After the death of
Aurangzeb the Mughal authority weakened, it
was not in a position to militarily enforce its
regulations in all parts of the empire. As a result
many provincial governors started to assert their
authority. In due course of time they gained
independent status. At the same time many
kingdoms which were subjugated by the
Mughals also claimed their independence. Some
new regional groups also consolidated and
emerged as political power with all these
developments, the period between 1707 and
1761 (third battle of Panipat, where Ahmed
Shah Abdali defeated the Maratha chiefs)
witnessed resurgence of regional identity that
buttressed both political and economic
decentralization. At the same time, intraregional
as well as interregional trade in local raw
materials, artifacts, and grains created strong ties
of economic interdependence, irrespective of
political and military relations.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PASSING OF THE MUGHAL EMPIRE</i></strong></div>

In 1707, when Aurangzeb died, serious
threats from the peripheries had begun to
accentuate the problems at the core of the empire.
The new emperor, Bahadur Shah I (or Shah
Alam; ruled 1707-12), followed a policy of
compromise, pardoning all nobles who had
supported his rivals. He granted them
appropriate territories and postings. He never
abolished jizya, but the effort to collect the tax
were not effective. In the beginning he tried to
gain greater control over the Rajput states of the
rajas of Amber (later Jaipur) and Jodhpur. When
his attempt met with firm resistance he realized
the necessity of a settlement with them. However,
the settlement did not restore them to fully
committed warriors for the Mughal cause. The
emperor's policy toward the Marathas was also
that of half-hearted conciliation. They continued
to fight among themselves as well as against the
Mughals in the Deccan. Bahadur Shah was,
however, successful in conciliating Chatrasal, the
Bundela chief, and Churaman, the Jat chief; the
latter also joined him in the campaign against
the Sikhs.
<br>
<br>
<b>Jahandar Shah (ruled 1712-13)</b> was a weak
and ineffective ruler. His wazir Zulfiqar Khan
assumed the executive direction of the empire
with unprecedented powers. Zulfiqar believed
that it was necessary to establish friendly
relations with the Rajputs and the Marathas and
to conciliate the Hindu chieftains in general in
order to save the empire. He reversed the policies
of Aurangzeb. The hated jizya was abolished.
He continued the old policy of suppression
against the Sikhs. His goal was to reconcile all
those who were willing to share power within
the Mughal institutional framework. Zulfiqar
Khan made several attempts at reforming the
economic system.
<br>
<br>
He failed in his efforts to enhance the
revenue collection of the state. When Farrukh
Siyar, son of the slain prince Azimush-Shan,
challenged Jahandar Shah and Zulfiqar Khan
with a large army and funds from Bihar and
Bengal, the rulers found their coffers depleted.
In desperation, they looted their own palaces,
even ripping gold and silver from the walls and
ceilings, in order to finance an adequate army.
Farrukh Siyar (ruled 1713-19) owed his victory
and accession to the Sayyid brothers, Abdullah
Khan and Husain Ali Khan Baraha. The Sayyids
thus earned the offices of wazir and chief
bakhshi and acquired control over the affairs of
state. They promoted the policies initiated earlier
by Zulfiqar Khan. Jizya and other similar taxes
were immediately abolished. The brothers finally
suppressed the Sikh revolt and tried to conciliate
the Rajputs, the Marathas, and the Jats.
However, this policy was hampered by
divisiveness between the wazir and the emperor,
as the groups tended to ally themselves with one
or the other. The Jats once again started
plundering the royal highway between Agra and
Delhi. Farrukh Siyar deputed Raja Jai Singh to
lead a punitive campaign against them but
wazir negotiated a settlement over the raja's
head. As a result, throughout northern India
zamindars either revolted violently or simply
refused to pay assessed revenues. On the other
hand, Farrukh Siyar compounded difficulties in
the Deccan by sending letters to some Maratha
chiefs urging them to oppose the forces of the
Deccan governor, who happened to be the
deputy and an associate of Sayyid Husain Ali
Khan. Finally, in 1719, the Sayyid brothers
brought Ajit Singh of Jodhpur and a Maratha
force to Delhi to depose the emperor. The murder
of Farrukh Siyar created a wave of revulsion
against the Sayyids among the various factions
of nobility, who were also jealous of their
growing power. Many of these, in particular the
old nobles of Aurangzeb's time, resented the
wazir's encouragement of revenue farming,
which in their view was mere shop keeping and
violated the age- old Mughal notion of statecraft.
In Farrukh Siyar's place the brothers raised to
the throne three young princes in quick
succession within eight months in 1719. Two of
these, Rafi- ud- Darajat and Rafi- ud- Dawlah
(Shah Jahan II), died of consumption. The third,
who assumed the title of Muhammad Shah,
exhibited sufficient vigour to set about freeing
himself from the brothers' control.
A powerful group under the leadership of
the Nizam-ul-Mulk, Chin Qilich Khan, and his
father's cousin Muhammad Amin Khan, the two
eminent nobles emerged finally to dislodge the
Sayyid brothers (1720). By the time Muhammad
Shah (ruled 1719-48) came to power, the nature
of the relationship between the emperor and the
nobility had almost completely changed.
Individual interests of the nobles had come to
guide the course of politics and state activities.
<br>
<br>
In 1720 Muhammad Amin Khan replaced
Sayyid Abdullah Khan as wazir; after Amin
Khan's death (January 1720), the office was
occupied by the Nizam-ul-Mulk for a brief period
until Amin Khan's son Qamar-ud-Din Khan
assumed the title in July 1724 by a claim of
hereditary right. The nobles themselves virtually
dictated these appointments. By this time the
nobles had assumed lot of powers. They used to
get farmans issued in the name of emperor in
their favours. The position of emperor was
preserved as a symbol only without real powers.
The real powers seated with important groups
of nobles. The nobles in control of the central
offices maintained an all-empire outlook, even
if they were more concerned with the stability
of the regions where they had their jagirs.
Farmans (mandates granting certain rights or
special privileges) to governors, faujdar, and
other local officials were sent, in conformity with
tradition, in the name of the emperor. Individual
failings of Aurangzeb's successors also
contributed to the decline of royal authority.
Jahandar Shah lacked dignity and decency;
Farrukh Siyar was fickle-minded; Muhammad
Shah was frivulous and fond of ease and luxury.
Opinions of the emperor's favourites weighed in
the appointments, promotions, and dismissals
even in the provinces.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bahadur Shah I (1707-1712)</b> Aurangzeb
died in 1707. A war of succession started
amongst his three surviving sons viz. Muazzamthe governor of Kabul, Azam-the governor of
Gujarat and Kam Baksh-The governor of
Bijapur. Muazzam defeated Azam and Kam
Baksh and ascended the Mughal throne with the
title of Bahadur Shah. He pursued pacifist policy
and was therefore also called Shah Bekhaber.
He also assumed the title of Shah Alam I. He
made peace with Guru Gobind Singh and
Chatrasal. He granted Sardeshmukhi to
Marathas and also released Shahu. He forced
Ajit Singh to submit but later in 1709. recognised
him as the Rana Marwar. He defeated Banda
Bahadur at Longarh and reoccupied Sirhird in
1711
<br>
<br>
<b>Jahandar Shah (1712-13)</b> ascended the
throne with the aid of Zulfikhar Khan. His
nephew, Farrukh Siyar, defeated him. He
abolished Jiziya .
<br>
<b>Farrukh Siyar (1713-1719)</b> ascended the
throne with the help of Sayyid brothers.
Abdullah Khan and Hussain Khan who were
Wazir and Mir Bakshi respectively Farrukh Siyar
was killed by the Sayyid brothers in 1719. Banda
Bahadur was captured at Gurudaspur and
executed.
Mohammad Shah (1719-48). During his
reign Nadir Shah raided India and took away
the peacock throne and the Kohinoor diamond.
He was a pleasure loving king and was nick
named Rangeela.
Nizam ul mulk was appointed Wazir in 1722
but he relinquished the post and marched to the
Deccan to found the state of Hyderabad.
Bengal acquired virtual independence during
the governorship of Murshid Quli Khan.
Saddat Khan Burhan-ul-Mulk who was
appointed governor of Awadh by him laid down
the foundation of the autonomous state.
Ahmed Shah's (1748-1754) During his reign,
Ahmed Shah Abdali(one of the ablest generals
of Nadir Shah) marched towards Delhi And the
Mughals ceded Punjab and Multan.
<br>
<br>
Alamgir (l754-l759) During his reign Ahmed
Shah Abdali occupied Delhi. Later, Delhi was
also plundered by the Marathas.
Shah Alam II (1759-1806) During his reign
Najib Khan Rohilla became very powerful in
Delhi so much so that Shah Alam II could not
enter Delhi. The Battle of Buxar (1764) was
fought during his reign.
Akbar Shah II (1806-37), During his reign
Lord Hastings ceased to accept the sovereignty
of Mughals and claimed an equal status.
BahadurShah II (1837-1862), The last
Mughal king , who was confined by the British
to the Red Fort. During the revolt of 1857 he was
proclaimed the Emperor by the rebellions. He
was deported to Rangoon following the 1857
rebellion.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DECLINE AND DISINTEGRATION
OF MUGHAL EMPIRE</i></strong></div>

Historians have held divergent views about
the main causes for the downfall of the Mughal
empire. J.N. Sarkar blames the rottenness at the
core of Indian society to be the main cause of
the disintegration. English Historian Irwin was
convinced that military inefficiency was the root
cause while another Historian Sydney Owen
believed that the fall of the Mughal empire was
due to the degeneracy of its sovereign. Satish
Chandra opines that the roots of the
disintegration of the Mughal empire may be
found in the Medieval Indian economy. 7The
main causes for the downfall of the Mughal
empire are the following.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Mughal system of government being
despotic much depended on the personality
of the emperor. Under a strong monarch
all went well with the administration but
after Aurangzeb all the Mughal rulers were
weaklings and therefore unable to meet the
challenges from within and without. Thus
these imbecile emperors were unable to
maintain the integrity of the empire.</li>
        <li>In the later stages of the Mughal rule, the
nobles discarded hard life of military
adventure and took to luxuries living. The
new nobility were at best courtiers and
rivaled one another in the subtle art of
flattery and finesse. Instead of 'Knights of
romance'. The nobles had no spirit to fight
and die for the empire because the later
Mughal emperors ceased to be impartial
judges.The decay in the ranks of the upper
classes deprived the state of the services
of energetic military leaders and capable
administrators.</li>
        <li>Towards the end of Aurangzeb's reign the
influential nobles of the court were divided
into several factions such as Persian,
Turani and Indian Muslims who
organized themselves into pressure
groups. The Turani and the Persian group
were together known as 'the Foreign
party' were pitched against the Indian
Muslim supported by Hindus which was
termed as 'the Hindustani party'. Each
group tried to win the emperor to its viewpoints and poison his ears against the
other faction. These groups kept the
country in a state of perpetual political
unrest, did not forge a united front even
in the face of foreign danger, and fought
battles, upsetting the peace of the country
and throwing administration to dogs.</li>
        <li>The Mughal military system was defective.
The army was organized on the feudal
basis where the common soldier owed
allegiance to the mansabdar rather than
the emperor. During the last Mughal
period, when the emperors grew weak,
this defect assumed alarming proportions.
Another defect of the Mughal army of
eighteenth century was their composition.
The soldiers were usually drawn from
Central Asia who came to India to make
fortunes,not to loose them. These soldiers
changed sides without scruples and were
constantly plotting either to betray or
supplant their employers. Irwine points a
series of fault such as indiscipline, want
of cohesion, luxurious habits, inactivity,
bad commissariat and cumbrous
equipment among the degenerate Mughals
except the personal courage they had. In
fighting capacity the Mughal army was
nothing more than an armed rabble.
Bernier compares them to a herd of
animals that fled at the first shock. The
Mughal artillery proved ineffective against
the guerilla tactics of the Marathas.</li>
        <li>The Mughal government was essentially
a police government and failed to effect a
fusion between the Hindus and Muslims
and create a composite nation. The
Mughal government confined its attention
mainly to the maintenance of internal and
external affair and collection of revenue.
The effort made by Akbar to weld the
people into a nation was undone by the
bigotry of Aurangzeb and weak
successors.</li>
        <li>The absence of the law of primogeniture
among the Mughals usually meant a war
of succession which provided the country
with the ablest son of the dying emperor
as the ruler. Under the later Mughals a
sinister factor entered in the law of
succession which was 'the survival of the
weakest'. The princes of the royal dynasty
receded to the background while struggle
was fought by leaders of rival factions
using royal princes as nominal
leaders.Powerful and influential nobles
acted as 'king makers', making and
unmaking emperors to suit their personal
interests. This system weakened the body
politic and crippled it financially and
militarily.</li>
        <li>Under the later Mughals the financial
condition worsened much more quickly
on one hand the outlying provinces
asserted their independence one by one
and ceased the payment of revenue to the
centre, while the numerous war of
successions and political convulsions
coupled with the lavish living of the
emperors emptied the royal treasury on
the other hand. The crisis of the Jagirdari
system heightened in this period.
Aurangzeb's long wars in the Deccan
besides emptying the royal treasury almost
ruined the trade and Industry of the
country. These conditions accentuated in
the eighteenth century.</li>
        <li>The most powerful external factor that
brought about the downfall of the Mughal
Empire was the rising power of the
Marathas under the Peshwas. The
Peshwas inaugurated the policy of Greater
Maharashtra and popularized the ideal
of 'Hindu-pad padshahi'. Though the
Marathas were unable in laying the
foundation of a stable empire in India,
they played a major role in bringing about
the decline of the Mughal Empire..</li>
        <li>The invasions of Nadir shah gave deathblows to the shattered Mughal Empire.
He deprived the Mughals of their wealth
and exposed to the world the military
weakness of the empire and its utter degeneration. The unsocial elements which
were so far afraid of the prestige of the
empire rose in rebellion and circumscribed
the very authority of the empire.</li>
        <li>The coming of the Europeans further
added pace to the disintegration of the
Mughal Empire. They outfitted Indian
princes in every sphere whether it was
war, diplomacy or trade and commerce.
The Mughals did not keep up pace with
the race of civilization and blew away by
a dynamic and progressive west.</li>
        <li>Although the expansion of the Mughal
Empire reached its zenith during the reign
of Aurangzeb, the disintegration of the
empire also began simultaneously due to
his policies. Firstly; Aurangzeb sought to
restore the Islamic character of the state.
His policy of religious bigotism proved
counter productive and provoked
Aurangzeb general discontent in the
country. It resulted into the rebellions of
Marathas, the Sikhs, the Bundelas and the
Jats. The imperialistic designs and narrow
religious policy of Aurangzeb turned the
Rajputs, reliable supporters of the imperial
dynasty, into enemies. The destruction of
Hindu temples and the reimposition of
'Jizyah' led to the uprising of Santamis
and others. Secondly, the policy of
Aurangzeb inspired the Sikhs (in Punjab)
and Marathas (in Maharashtra) to rose
against the imperial empire, Maratha
resistance to Mughai rule assumed
Aurangzeb national character and the
whole people participated in the struggle
for the defence of their religion and
liberties. They demoralized the Mughal
Armies through guerrilla mode of warfare
and broke their spirit of superiority.
Thirdly, the aggressive policy of
Aurangzeb towards the Shia Sultanates
of Bijapur and Golkunda marked the
beginning of acute difficulties. The
conquest of these kingdoms removed the
strongest local check on Maratha activities
and left them free to organize resistance
to the Mughal imperialism. Lastly, the
Deccan policy of continuous warfare in
the Deccan which continued for twenty
seven years, drained the resources of the
empire.These undue wars put up
Aurangzeb great financial drain on the
treasury. The cream of brave and
courageous Mughal soldiers perished in
the long drawn wars. The Deccan ulcer
proved fatal to the Mughal empire and
paved the way for hasty disintegration of
the Mughal empire.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE RISE OF REGIONAL
POLITIES AND STATES</i></strong></div>

The states that arose in India during the
phase of Mughal decline and the following
century (roughly 1700 to 1850) varied greatly in
terms of resources, longevity, and essential
character. Some of them- such as Hyderabad in
the south, was located in an area that had
harboured regional state in the immediate preMughal period and thus had an older local or
regional tradition of state formation. Others were
states that had a more original character and
derived from very specific processes that had
taken place in the course of the late sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. In particular, many
of the post- Mughal states were based on ethnic
or sectarian groupings- the Marathas, the Jats,
and the Sikhs. In due course, the enrichment of
the regions emboldened local land and powerholders to take up arms against external
authority. However, mutual rivalry and conflicts
prevented these rebels from consolidating their
interests into an effective challenge to the
empire. They relied on support from kinsfolk,
peasants, and smaller zamindars of their own
castes. Each local group wanted to maximize its
share of the prosperity at the expense of the
others. The necessity of emphasizing imperial
symbols was inherent in the kind of power
politics that emerged. Each of the contenders in
the regions, in proportion to his strength, looked
for and seized opportunities to establish his
dominance over the others in the neighbourhood.
They all needed a kind of legitimacy, which was
so conveniently available in the long-accepted
authority of the Mughal emperor. They had no
fear in collectively accepting the symbolic
hegemony of the Mughal centre, which had
come to co-exist with their ambitions.
The gradual weakening of the central
authority set in motion new types of provincial
kingdoms. Nobles with ability and strength
sought to build a regional base for themselves.
The wazir Chin Qilich Khan himself, showed
the path. Having failed to reform the
administration, he relinquished his office in 1723
and in October 1724 marched south to establish
the state of Hyderabad in the Deccan. The
Mughal court's chief concern at this stage was
to ensure the flow of the necessary revenue from
the provinces and the maintenance of at least
the semblance of imperial unity. Seizing upon
the disintegration of the empire, the Marathas
now began their northward expansion and
overran Malwa, Gujarat, and Bundelkhand.
Then, in 1738-39, Nadir Shah, who had
established himself as the ruler of Iran, invaded
India.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE MARATHA POWER</i></strong></div>

There is no doubt that the single most
important power that emerged in the long
twilight of the Mughal dynasty was the
Marathas. The most important Maratha warrior
clan was of the Bhonsles, Sivaji Bhonsle, emerged
as the most powerful figure in the southern
politics. The good fortune of Sivaji did not fall to
his sons and successors, Sambhaji, and his
younger brother, Rajaran. For a time it appeared
that Maratha power was on the decline. But a
recovery was effected in the early eighteenth
century, in somewhat changed circumstances.
A particularly important phase in this respect
is the reign of Sahu, who succeeded Rajaram in
1708. Sahu's reign, lasted for four decades upto
1749. It was marked by the ascendancy of a
lineage of Chitpavan Brahman ministers, who
virtually came to control central authority in the
Maratha state. The Bhonsles were reduced to
figureheads. Holding the title of peshwa (chief
minister), the first truly prominent figure of this
line is Balaji Visvanath, who had helped Sahu
in his rise to power. Visvanath and his successor,
Baji Rao I (peshwa between 1720 and 1740),
managed to bureaucratise the Maratha state to
a far greater extent than had been the case under
the early Bhonsles. They systematized the
practice of tribute gathering from Mughal
territories, under the heads of sardeshmukhi and
chauth (the two terms corresponding to the
proportion of tribute collected). They seem to
have consolidated methods of assessment and
collection of land revenue and other taxes, on
the lines of the Mughals. Much of the revenue
terminology used in the documents of the
peshwa and his subordinates derives from
Persian. This suggests a greater continuity
between Mughal and Maratha revenue
practices.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE MARATHA CONFEDERACY</i></strong></div>

By the close of Sahu's reign, a few powerful
Maratha Kingdoms were in complete control of
their territories. This period saw the development
of sophisticated networks of trade, banking, and
finance in the territories under their control. The
banking houses based at Pune, had their
branches in Gujarat, Ganges Valley, and the
south. Attention was also paid to the Maritime
affairs. Bala ji Visvanath took some care to
cultivate the Angria clan, which controlled a fleet
of vessels based in Kolaba and other centres of
the west coast. These ships posed a threat not
only to the new English settlement of Bombay,
but to the Portuguese at Goa, Bassein, and
Daman. On the other hand, there also emerged
a far larger domain of activity away from the
original heartland of the Marathas. Of these
chiefs, the most important were the Gaikwads
(Gaekwars), the Sindhias, and the Holkars. Also,
there were branches of the Bhonsle family that
relocated to Kolhapur and Nagpur, while the
main line remained in the Deccan heartland, at
Satara. Let us examine their areas of influence.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE BHONSLES OF NAGPUR</i></strong></div>

Unlike the Kolhapur Bhonsles and the
descendants of Vyamkoji at Thanjavur, both of
whom claimed a status equal to that of the
Satara raja, the line at Nagpur was clearly
subordinate to the Satara rulers. A crucial figure
from this line is Raghuji Bhonsle (ruled 1727-55),
who was responsible for the Maratha incursions
on Bengal and Bihar in the 1740s and early
1750s. The relations of his successors, Janoji,
Sabaji, and Mudhoji, with the peshwas and the
Satara line were varying, and it is in this sense
that these domains can be regarded as only
loosely confederated, rather than tightly bound
together. Other subordinate rulers who emerged
under the overarching umbrella provided by the
Satara ruler and his peshwa were equally
somewhat opportunistic in their use of politics.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE GAIKWADS OF BARODA</i></strong></div>

The Gaikwads, gathered prominence in the
1720. Initially they were subordinate not only to
the Bhonsles but also to the powerful Dabhade
family. However, it was only after the death of
Sahu, when the power of the peshwas was
further enhanced, that the position of the
Gaikwads truly improved. By the early 1750s,
their rights on large portion of the revenues of
Gujarat were recognized by the peshwa. The
expulsion of the Mughal governor of the Gujarat
province from his capital of Ahmadabad in 1752
set the seal on the process. The Gaikwads
preferred, however, to establish their capital in
Baroda, causing realignment in the network of
trade and consumption in the area. The rule at
Baroda of Damaji (d. 1768) was followed by a
period of some turmoil. The Gaikwads still
remained partly dependent on Pune and the
peshwa, especially to intervene in moments of
succession crisis. The eventual successor of
Damaji, Fateh Singh (ruled 1771- 89), did not
remain allied to the peshwa for long in the late
1770s and early 1780s, he chose to negotiate a
settlement with the English East India Company,
which eventually led to increased British
interference in his affairs. By 1800, the British
rather than the peshwa were the final arbiters
in determining succession among the Gaikwads,
who became subordinate rulers under them in
the nineteenth century.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE HOLKARS OF LNDORE</i></strong></div>

In the case of the Holkars the rise in status
and wealth was particularly rapid and marked.
Initially they had very little political power.
However by 1730s their chief Malhar Rao Holkar
consolidated his position. He was granted a large
share of the chauth collection in Malwa, eastern
Gujarat, and Khandesh. Within a few years,
Malhar Rao consolidated his own principality
at Indore, from which his successors controlled
important trade routes as well as the crucial
trading centre of Burhanpur. After him, control
of the dynastic fortunes fell largely to his son's
widow, Ahalya Bai, who ruled from 1765 to 1794
and brought Holkar power to great glory.
Nevertheless, their success could not equal that
of the next great chieftain family, the Sindhias.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE SINDHIAS OF GWALIOR</i></strong></div>

The Sindhias carved a prominent place for
themselves in North Indian politics in the decades
following the third battle of Panipat (1761).
Again, like the Holkars, the Sindhias were based
largely in central India, first at Ujjain, and later
(from the last quarter of the. 18th century) in
Gwalior. During the long reign of Mahadaji
Sindhia (1761-94) family's fortunes were truly
consolidated.
<br>
<br>
Mahadaji, proved an effective and innovative
military commander. He employed a large
number of European soldiers in his force. His
power grew rapidly after 1770. During this
period he managed to make substantial inroads
into North India that had been weakened by
Afghan attacks. He intervened with some effect
in the Mughal court during the reign of Shah
Alam II. The Mughal king made him the "deputy
regent" of his affairs in the mid-1780s. His
shadow fell not only across the provinces of
Delhi and Agra but also on Rajasthan and
Gujarat, making him the most formidable
Maratha leader of the era. The officials of the
East India Company were very cautious in
dealing with him. His relations with the acting
peshwa, Nana Fadnavis at Pune were fraught
with tension.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, the momentum generated by
Mahadaji could not be maintained by his
successor Daulat Rao Sindhia (ruled 1794-1827),
who was defeated by the British and forced by
treaty in 1803 to surrender his territories both to
the north and to the west. The careers of some
of these potentates, especially Mahadaji Sindhia,
illustrate the potency of Mughal symbols even
in the phase of Mughal decline. For instance,
after recapturing Gwalior from the British,
Mahadaji took care to have his control of the
town sanctioned by the Mughal emperor.
Equally, he zealously guarded the privileges and
titles granted to him by Shah Alam, such as amir
al-umara ("head of the amirs") and na'ib wakiii mutlaq ("deputy regent"). In this he was not
alone. Instances in the 18th century of states that
wholly threw off all pretense of allegiance to the
Mughals are rare. Rather, the Mughal system of
honours and titles, as well as Mughal- derived
administrative terminology and fiscal practices,
continued despite the decline of imperial power.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HYDERABAD</i></strong></div>

Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah, the founder of
Hyderabad state, was one of the most powerful
members at the court of the Mughal Emperor
Farrukh Siyar. He was entrusted first with the
governorship of Awadh, and later given charge
of the Deccan. As the Mughal governor of the
Deccan provinces, Asaf Jah already had full
control over its political and financial
administration. Taking advantage of the turmoil
in the Deccan and the competition amongst the
court nobility, he gathered power in his hands
and became the actual ruler of that region.
Asaf Jah brought skilled soldiers and administrators from northern India who welcomed the
new opportunities in the south. He appointed
mansabdars and granted jagirs. Although he
was still a servant of the Mughal emperor, he
ruled quite independently without seeking any
direction from Delhi or facing any interference.
The Mughal emperor merely confirmed the decisions already taken by the Nizam.
The state of Hyderabad was constantly
engaged in a struggle against the Marathas to
the west and with independent Telugu warrior
chiefs (nayakas) of the plateau. The ambitions
of the Nizam to control the rich textileproducing areas of the Coromandel coast in the
east were checked by the British who were
becoming increasingly powerful in that region

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE NAWABS OF BENGAL</i></strong></div>

Murshid Quli Khan who started his career
as Diwan of Bengal under Aurangzeb became
virtually independent with the growing
weakening of the central authority. However,
he regularly sent tribute to the Mughal emperor.
Ali Vardi Khan deposed the family of Murshid
Quli Khan and made himself the Nawab in 1739.
These Nawabs brought stability and peace and
promoted agriculture, trade and industry. Equal
opportunities were given to both Hindus and
Muslims. But the Nawabs could not visualise the
long term implications of the presence of the
European trading companies and neglected
military preparedness.
In 1756-1757, the successor of Ali Vardi
Khan, Siraj- ud - Daulah had to fight the English
East India Company over the trading rights. His
defeat in the battle of Plassey in June 1757 paved
the way for subjugation of Bengal as well as
India.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE NAWABS OF AWADHL</i></strong></div>

With the weakening central control the
Mughal suba of Awadh also saw emerging
ambitions of a provincial governor- Saadat Khan
Burhan ul Mulk. Saadat Khan disciplined the
local zamindars and gave shape to a well paid,
well armed and well trained army. Before his
death in 1739, Saadat Khan made the provincial
head a hereditary position. His successors Safdar
Jung and Asaf ud Daulah not only played very
decisive role in the politics of northern India but
also gave a long term administrative stability to
the nawabi of Awadh. Under the Nawabs firstly
Faizabad and then Lucknow became the cultural
rival of Delhi in the spheres of arts, literature
and crafts. Regional architecture reflected itself
in the form of Imambarah and other buildings.
The evolution of dance form Kathak was the
outcome of cultural synthesis.



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE SIKHS OF PUNJAB</i></strong></div>

The Mughal force supressed the Sikhs under
Banda Bahadur. But this did not put an end to
Sikh resistance to Mughal authority. In the 1720s
and 1730s, Amritsar emerged as a centre of Sikh
activity, mainly because of its preeminence as a
pilgrimage centre. Kapur Singh, the most
important of the Sikh leaders of the time,
operated from its vicinity. He gradually set about
consolidating a revenue-cum military system.
Some Sikh groups also started consolidating
themselves as political force. These activities
discouraged the attempts by the Mughal
governors of Lahore Suba to set up an
independent power base for themselves in the
region. First Abdus Samad Khan and then his
son Zakariya Khan attempted to control
sovereign power. After the latter's demise in
1745, the balance shifted still further in favour
of the Sikh warrior- leaders, such as Jassa Singh
Ahluwalia. He later on founded the kingdom of
Kapurthala. The mushrooming of pockets under
the authority of Sikh leaders was thus a feature
of the two decades preceding Ahmed Shah
Abdali's invasion of the Punjab. This process was
evident in the eastern Punjab and Bari Doab.
Though the principal opposition faced by Abdali
in his campaigns of the 1750s and 1760s in the
Punjab came from the Sikhs, Marathas also
played a role of significance on this occasion.
Eventually, by the mid- 1760s, Sikh authority
over Lahore was established, and the Afghans
were not able to consolidate their early gains.
Under Ahmad Shah's successor, Timur Shah
(ruled 1772-93), some of the territories and towns
that had been taken by the Sikhs (such as Multan)
were recovered, and the descendants of Ahmad
Shah continued to harbour ambitions in this
direction until the end of the century. But by the
1770s, they were dealing with a confederation
of about 60 Sikh chieftains, some of these were
to emerge as princely states under the Britishsuch as Nabha and Patiala.
The Sikh chiefdoms continued many of the
administrative practices initiated by the
Mughals. The main subordinates of the chiefs
were given jagir assignments. The Persianized
culture of the Mughal bureaucracy continued to
hold sway. It was one such chief, Ranjit Singh,
grandson of Charhat Singh Sukerchakia, who
eventually welded these principalities for a brief
time into a larger entity. Ranjit Singh's effective
rule lasted four decades, from 1799 to 1839. The
power of the English East India Company was
growing in all parts of the country during this
period. Within ten years of his death, the British
had annexed Punjab. His rise to power was based
on superior military force, partly serviced by
European mercenaries and by the strategic
location of the territories that he had inherited
from his father. Ranjit Singh's kingdom
represented the culmination of nearly a century
of Sikh rebellions against Mughal rule. It was
based on the intelligent application of principles
of statecraft. He used as his capital the great
trading city of Lahore, which he captured in
1799. Having gained control of the trade routes,
he imposed monopolies on the trade in salt,
grain, and textiles from Kashmir to enhance his
revenues. Using these earnings, he built up an
army of 40,000 cavalry and infantry. By the year
1809 he was undisputed master of the most of
Punjab.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JAIPUR AND OTHER
RAJPUTANA STATES</i></strong></div>

Jaipur (earlier Amber) in eastern Rajasthan,
was a Rajput principality controlled by the
Kachwaha clan. In the early eighteenth century,
the ruler Jai Singh Sawai took steps to increase
his power manyfold. This was done by: (i)
arranging to have his jagir assignment in the
vicinity of his home territories and (ii) by taking
on rights on land revenue through farming (for
collection of land tax rights on a parcel of land
that are rented by the state to an individual),
which was gradually made permanent. By the
time of his death in 1743, Jai Singh (after whom
Jaipur came to be named) had emerged as the
single most important ruler in the region. Most
of the larger Rajput states were constantly
involved in petty quarrels and civil wars. Ajit
Singh of Marwar was killed by his own son.
In the 1750s Suraj Mal the Jat ruler of
Bharatpur, like Jai Singh- adopted a modified
form of Mughal revenue administration in his
territories. However, by this time, the fortunes
of the Jaipur kingdom were seriously in question.
Under threat from the Marathas, recourse had
to be taken to adopt short- term fiscal exactions.
At the same time a series of crop failures in the
1750s and 60s adversely affected fragile
agriculture. The second half of the eighteenth
century was thus marked by an economic
depression, accompanied by a decline in the
political power of Jaipur. During this period
Jaipur became a vulnerable target for the
ambitions of the Marathas, and of Mahadaji
Sindhia in particular.

The states discussed so far, with the exception
of Maratha, were all landlocked. This did not
mean that trade was not an important element
in their makeup, for the kingdom of Ranjit Singh
was crucially linked to trade. However, lack of
access to the sea greatly increased the
vulnerability of a state, particularly in an era
when the major power was the English East
India Company, itself initially a maritime enterprise.
