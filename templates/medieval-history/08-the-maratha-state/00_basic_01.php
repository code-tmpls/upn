<h3>The Maratha State</h3>


The emergence and growth of the Maratha
state during the 17th century was an important
episode in the history of India. The Territory
which include modern state of Bombay Konkan,
Kandesh, Berar, part of Madhya Pradesh, and
part of Hyderabad state was Maratha state. The
history of the rise of the Marathas is the history
of the rise of an organized group of people
inhabiting the territory of Maharashtra.
Different factors contributed in the rise of
Maratha nationalism and political power of the
Marathas. The geographical condition of
Maharashtra helped in the rise of the Marathas.
Larger part of Maharashtra is plateau where
man has to struggle hard for his existence. This
made Marathas courageous and sturdy. The
plateau provided every facility for defence
including the construction of farts at every hill
top-while it was difficult for Aurangzeb foreign
invader to get supplies besides the difficulty of
movement with larger armies in an unknown
land. The plateau also provided good facility for
guerilla-warfare to the Marathas. The rise of the
Marathas was the result of the efforts of entire
Maratha people who on the basis of unity of their
languages, literature, community and homeland
gave birth to Maratha nationalism and desired
to create and independent state of their own.
The Marathas developed the story spirit of
nationalism which made them the most
powerful group of people in India.The saints of
Bhakti Movement in Maharashtra had spread
the idea of equality which helped for the growth
of unity among in people.
<br>
<br>
The Marathas had important positions in the
administrative and military system of Deccan
states. Although a number of influential Maratha
families exercised local authority in some area,
the Maratha did not have any large well
established state as Rajaputs had. The credit for
setting up such a large state goes to Shahji
Bhonsali and his son Shivaji.
<br>
<br>
<b>Shivaji:</b> Shivaji was born in 1627. He was
the son of Shahji Bhonsle and Jija Bai.Shahji
Bhonsle acted as the king maker in
Ahammednagar. After its extinction, transferred
his service to Bijapur. Shivaji spent his childhood
under the protection of a Brahmin official called
Dadaji Kondadev. While Jija bai built up the
character of Shivaji, Kond Dev trained him in
the art of fighting and administration.Shivaji
aimed to create an independent kingdom of his
own right from the beginning of his career. His
primary aim was to carve out an independent
kingdom for himself in Maharashtra.M.G.
Ranade has cleared the aim of Shivaji by dividing
events of his life into four parts. During the first
six years of his political career, Shivaji simply
desired to organize the neighbouring Maratha
chiefs under him. He had to fight against Bijapur
to active this purpose. During the course of next
ten years he encouraged Maratha nationalism
and attempted to extend the territory under his
rule. He fought against the ablest nobles of
Bijapur during this period and succeeded. He
came in to conflict with the growing power of
the Mughals Towards the Deccan. He succeeded
against the Mughals as well. Between the period
1674-80 the legalized his kingdom, held his
coronation and assumed the title of Chatrapathi.
Even during the period of Tutelage of Kunda
Dev, Shivaji started capturing hill forts near
Poona against his wishes. At the age of 20 years
he started his adventures on a wider scale. Many
courageous Maratha leader gathered round him.
In 1643 Shivaji captured the fort of the singhgarh
from Bijapur and then gradually the forts of
Chaken,Purandar,Varanati,Torna, Supa,
Tikona, Lohgarch, Rairi were taken over.Shivaji
had won over many of his officers of Bijapur to
his side by bringing them.The conquest of Javli
made him in disputed master.
<br>
<br>
Shivaji came into conflict with the Mughals
first in 1657. Aurangazeb had attacked Bijapur,
which sought his help Shivaji could realize that
it was in his interest also to check the power of
the Mughals from penetrating in the Deccan.
Therefore he helped Bijapur and attacked south
west territory of the Mughals. He looted Junar
and troubled the Mughals at several places. But
when Bijapur made peace with the Mughals, he
also stopped raids on Mughals territory. With
Aurangazeb away in the north, Shivaji resumed
his career of conquest at the expense of Bijapur.
He captured Konkan. Bijapur now decided to
take stern action Afzalkhan who was a reputed
commander of Bijapur was deputed for his task
in 1659. With a large army, He tried to terrify
Shivaji by wholesale destruction of temples,
agriculture and populace with in his territories
Afzalkhan assured Shivaji that if he would come
to meet him in person and agreed to accept the
suzerainty of Bijapur he would so given the
additional territory as Jagir. Shivaji got scant of
Afzalkhan and decided the pay him in the some
coins. He agreed to meet Afzalkhan after a
solemn promise of his personal safety.Convinced
that this was a trap. Shivaji went prepared and
murdered khan in cunning but daring manner,
Shivaji put his leaderless army to rout captured
all goods and equipment including his artillery.
Flushed with victory, the Maratha troops
overran the powerful fort of Panhala and poured
in to south Konkan and Kolhapur districts
making extensive conquest.
<br>
<br>
Shivaji's exploits made him a legendary
figure. His name passed from house to house and
was credited with magical powers. People
flocked to him from the Maratha areas to join
his army. Meanwhile, Aurangazeb was
anxiously watching the rise of a Maratha power
so near the Mughal frontier. Aurangazeb
instructed the new Mughal governor of Deccan,
Shiasta Khan to invade Shivaji dominion. At first
the war went bodly for Shivaji Shaista Khan
occupied Poona and made it his headquarter.
He sent army to capture Konkan from
Shivaji.The Mughal secured their contest on
north Konkan. Driven into a corner Shivaji made
bold stroke. He infiltrated in to the camp of
Shaista Khan at Poona and at night attacked
Khan, killing his son, and one of his captains
and wounding khan. This daring attack put the
Khan in to disgrace. In anger Aurangazeb
transferred Shaista Khan to Bengal. Meanwhile
Shivaji made another bold move. He attacked
Surat and looted it in to his hearts content,
returning home laden with Treasure.
<br>
<br>
After the failure of Shaista Khan Aurangazeb
deputed Raja Jai Singh of Amber to deal with
Shivaji.Full military and administrative authority
was conferred on Jai singh so that he was not in
any way dependent on the Mughal victory in
the Deccan, unlikes his predecessors, Jia singh
did not under estimate the Marathas. He made
careful diplomatic and military preparation. He
appealed to all the rivals and opponents of Shivaji
in order to isolate Shivaji. Marching to Poona,
Jai Singh decided to strike at the heart of Shivaji
territories fort purendar where Shivaji had
lodged his family and his treasure. Jai singh
closely besieged Purandar (1665) be acting off
all the Maratha attempt to relieve it. With the
fall of the fart at sight, Shivaji opened negotiation
with Jai Singh. In 1665 the treaty of purandar
was signed between two. The following terms
were agreed upon.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Shivaji surrendered 23 of his forts, and
territory which yielded annual revenue of
4 lakhs of heen.</li>
        <li>Shivaji was left with only 12 forts and
territory which yielded annual revenue of
one lakh him.</li>
        <li>Shivaji accepted the suzerainty of the
Mughals.</li>
        <li>Shivaji agreed to support the Mughals
against Bijapur.</li>
        <li>Shivaji agreed to pay forty lakhs of him too
the Mughals in 13 years.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


This term of the treaty embittered the relation
of Bijapur with Shivaji. In 1666 Shivaji went to
Agra to meet emperor Aurangazeb, Jia Singh
tempted Shivaji that there was every possibility
of getting governorship of Mughals territory in
the Deccan if he would go to meet the emperor
in person. He assured Shivaji of his personal
safety.Shivaji visited Agra along with his son
Shambhuji. He was presented before the
emperor by Ram Singh, son of Jai Singh. The
emperor neglected his presence and offered him
a place to stand among the officers of the rank
of 5,000 mansab. Shivaji felt humiliated and left
the court immediately Ram singh kept Shivaji in
the Jaipur Bhavan but virtually he was a prisoner
there, since Shivaji had come to Agra on Jai
Singh assurance, Aurangazeb wrote to Jai Singh
for advice. Jai singh strongly argued for a lenient
treatment for Shivaji. But before any decision
could be taken, Shivaji escaped from detention.
There is no doubt that Shivaji's visit to Agra
proved to be turning point in Mughal relations
with the Marathas Aurangazeb attached little
value to the alliance with Shivaji.For him Shivaji
was just a petty bhumia (land holders). In 1670
AD Shivaji again started fighting against the
Mughals and succeeded in capturing many farts
from among those which he had surrounded to
by the treaty of Purandar. He conquered forts
like singhgarh, Purandar, Kalyan Mahuli etc.
and successfully raided to the territories of the
Mughals in Deccan. He also plundered Surat in
1670 for the second time. Thus with in a few
years; Shivaji captured many farts and territories
from the Mughals and Bijapur.
<br>
<br>
In 1674 Shivaji held his coronation, assumed
the title Chatrapathi and made Raigarh his
capital. In 1677-78 AD Shivaji attacked east
Karnatak on the pretext of getting share of his
fathers jagir from his brother. He then conquered
the forts of Jinji and vollore and the territory
between rivers Thungabhadra and Kaveri in
Karnataka. The Karnatak expedition was the last
major expedition of Shivaji. Shivaji died in 1680
shortly after his return the Karnatak expedition.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SHIVAJI'S ADMINISTRATION</i></strong></div>

Shivaji had laid the foundation of a sound
system of administration. His administrative
system was largely borrowed from the
administrative practices of the Deccan state. Like
all other medieval rulers, Shivaji was a despot
with all powers concentrated in his hands. He
possessed all executive and legislative
power.'Shivaji' was a great organizer and
constructive civilian administrator. The one of
the novelty of Shivajis administration was the
introduction of Maratha language as the state
language.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Administration</i></strong></div>
        
The king was at the helm of the affairs. The
administration was divided into eight
departments headed by ministers who are some
times called Ashta pradhan. The eight ministers
were (1) Peshwa who looked after the finances
and general administration. (2) Sari-Naubat who
was the Senapati. (3) Majumdar looked after the
accounts. (4) Waqai navis looked after the
intelligence, post and household affairs (5)
Surnavis or Chitnis looked after official
correspondence (6) Dabir looked after foreign
affairs (7) Nyayadhish looked after justice and
(8) Pandit Rao looked after ecclesiastical affairs.
The ashtapradhan was not a creation of
Shivaji. Many of these officers like Peshwa,
Majumdar, Waqai navis, Dabir and Surnavis
had existed under the Deccani rulers also. All
the members of the astha pradhan except Pandit
Rao and Nyaydhish were asked to lead military
campaigns. Under Shivaji these offices were
neither hereditary nor permanent. They held the
office at the pleasure of the king. They were also
frequently transferred. Each of the ashta pradhan
was assisted by eight assistants diwan,
Majumdar, Fadnis, Sabnis; Karkhanis, Chitnis,
Jamadar and Potnis. Chitnis dealt with all
diplomatic correspondences and wrote all royal
letters. The Fadnis used to respond to the letters
of commanders of the forts. The potnis looked
after the income and expenditure of the royal
treasury.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Provincial and Local Administration</i></strong></div>
        
The provincial administration was also
organized on the Deccani and Mughal system.
All the provincial units already existed under the
Deccani rulers. Shivaji reorganized and in
certain cases renamed them. The provinces were
known as Prants.The Prants were under the
charge of subedar. Over a number of Subedar
there were Sarsubedar to control and supervise
the work of subedar. Smaller than prant were
Tarfs which were headed by a havaldar. Then
there were Mauzas or villages which were the
lowest unit of administration. At the level of
village, Kulkarni used to keep accounts and
maintained records while Patil had legal and
policing power. At the level of Pargana,
Deshpande used to keep account and maintain
records while Deshmukh had legal and policing
powers. The Police officer in rural area was
called Faujdar and in urban area was called
Kotwal. The Maratha polity did not have unified
civilian-cummilitary rank. Under the Marathas
performance based Brahmin elites manned the
central bureaucracy and the local
administration. In this capacity they were called
Kamvishdar who enjoyed wide powers of tax
assessment and collection. They adjudicated
cases, provided information about local
conditions and kept records. Later on, the British
District collector was modelled on this Maratha
officer only.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ARMY</i></strong></div>

Cavalry and infantry constituted the
primary part of the army of Shivaji. The paga
cavalrymen were called the bargirs. They were
provided horses by the state while the silahdars
purchased their armies and horses themselves.
The paga cavalry was well organized. Twenty
five horsemen formed a unit which was placed
under a havildar. Shivaji preferred to give cash
salaries to the regular soldiers, though some time
the chief received revenue grants strict disciplines
was maintained in the army. The plunder taken
by each soldiers during compaign was strictly
accounted for, farts and security occupied an
important place in the army organization of
Shivaji. Shivaji maintained a navy as well. Shivaji
had 400 ships of different kind. The navy was
divided in to two parts and each part was
commanded by darive Nayak and mai Nayak
respectively.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FINANCE AND REVENUE</i></strong></div>

The revenue system seems to have been
patterned on the system of Malik Ambar land
revenue; Trade Tax etc. were the primary source
of the fixed income of Shivaji.But income from
these sources was not sufficient to meet the
expenditure of the state. Therefore Shivaji
collected the chauth and Sardeshmukhi from the
territory which was either under his enemies or
under his own influence. The chauth was 1/4
part of the income of the particular territory
while the Sardeshmukhi was 1/10. Shivaji
collected these taxes simply by force of his army.
These taxes constituted primary source of the
income of Shivaji and after wards helped in the
extension of the power and territory of the
Marathas. The revenue system of Shivaji was
Rytowari in which the state kept direct contact
with peasants. Shivaji mostly avoided the system
of assigning Jagir to his officers and whenever
he assigned Jagir to them, the right of collecting
the revenue was kept with state officials.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SCCESSORS</i></strong></div>

<b>Sambhaji (1680-89)</b>
<br>
The war of succession
between Sambhaji, the elder son, and Rajaram,
the younger son, of Sivaji, resulted in the victory
of the former and imprisonment of the later.
Sambhaji provided protection and support to
Akbar, the rebellious son of Aurangzeb. But
Akbar failed against his father and departed to
Persia. Sambhaji was also captured at
Sangamesvar by a Mughal noble and executed.
Rajaram (1689-1700) : Rajaram was released
and succeeded to the throne with the help of
the ministers at Raigarh. He fled from Raigarh
to Jinji in 1689 (Jinji remained his base till 1698)
due to a Mughal invasion in which Raigarh was
captured along with Sambhaji's wife and son
(Shahu) by the Mughals. Jinji fell to the Mughal
(1698) and Rajaram escaped to Visalgarh
(Maharashtra). Rajaram died at Satara, which
had become the capital after the fall of Jinji.
Rajaram's administrative changes included the
creation of the new post of Pratimdhi, thus taking
the total number of ministers to nine.
Sivaji II and Tarabai (1700-1707) : Rajaram
was succeeded by his minor son Sivaji II under
the guardianship of his mother Tarabai. He
attacked Berar (1703), Baroda (1706) and
Aurangabad.
Shah (1707-1749) : Shahu was released by
the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah and this was
the beginning of civil war (1707-14) between him
and Tarabai. Tarabai's army was defeated by
Shahu at the battle of Khed (1700) and Shahu
occupied Satara. The final defeat and
imprisonment of Tarabai by Shahu came in
1714. But the southern part of the Maratha
kingdom with its capital at Kolhapur continued
to be under the control of the decendants of
Rajaram (Sivaji II and later Sambhaji II).
Shahu's reign saw the rise of Peshwaship and
transformation of the Maratha kingdom into an
empire based on the principle of confederacy.
