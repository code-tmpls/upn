<h3>European Arrival</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DUTCH</i></strong></div>

<b>Formation of the Company :</b> In March, 1602,
by a charter of the Dutch parliament the Dutch
East India Company was formed with powers
to make wars, concluded treaties, acquire
territories and build fortresses.
<br>
<br>
<b>Establishment of Factories :</b> The Dutch set
up factories at Masulipatam (1605), Pulicat
(1610), Surat (1616), Bimilipatam (1641), Karikal
(1645), Chinsura (1653), Kasimbazar,
Baranagore, Patna, Balasore, Negapatam (all in
1658) and Cochin (1663).
<br>
<br>
<b>Overthrow of Portuguese :</b> In the 17th
century, they supplanted the Portuguese as the
most dominant power in European trade with
the East, including India. Pulicat was their centre
in India till 1690, after which Negapatam
replaced it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Beginning of Anglo-Dutch Rivalry :</b> In the
middle of the 17th century (1654) the English
began to emerge as a formidable colonial power.
After 60-70 years of rivalry with the English, the
Dutch power in India began to decline by the
beginning of the 18th century. Their final
collapse came with their defeat by the English
in the battle of Bedera in 1759.
<br>
<br>
<b>Loss of Settlement :</b> One by one the Dutch
lost their settlement to the English. Their
expulsion from their poessessions in India by the
British came in 1795.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ENGLISH</i></strong></div>

<b>Arrival of Mildenhall :</b> Before the East India
Company establised trade in the India, it was a
merchant adventurer, John Mildenhall who
arrived in India in 1599 by the overland route,
ostensively for the purpose of trade with Indian
merchants.
<br>
<br>
<b>Formation of the Company :</b> Popularly
known as the 'English East India Company', it
was formed by a group of merchants known as
the 'Merchant Adventures' in 1599. A charter to
the new Company was granted by Queen
Elizabeth (December, 1600) giving it the
monopoly of Eastern trade for 15 years. A fresh
charter even before the expiry of the first charter
was granted by James I (1609), giving it a
monopolgy for an indefinite period.
<br>
<br>
<b>Decision to open a factory at Surat :</b>
Following the decision of the East India
Company to open a factory at Surat (1608),
Captain Hawkins arrived at Jahangir's court
(1609) to seek permission. Jahangir although
initially willing to grant permission later refused
due to Portuguese pressure. But when a
Portuguese fleet was defeated by the English
under Captain Best at Swally (near Surat) in
1612, a farman was issued by Jahangir
permitting the English to erect a factory at Surat
(1613).
<br>
<br>
<b>Arrival of Thomas Roe :</b> Sir Thomas came
to India as ambassador of James 1 to Jahangir's
court in 1615 and stayed there till the end of 1618,
during which period he obtained the emperor's
permission to trade and erect factories in
different parts of the empire. He left India for
England in February, 1619.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Establishment of Factories</i></strong></div>

<b>West Coast :</b> The English established factories
at Agra, Ahmadabad, Baroda and Broach by
1619, all of which were placed under the control
of the President and council of the Surat factory.
The company acquired Bombay from Charles II
on lease at an annual rental of ten pounds in
1668. Gerald Aungier was its first governor from
1669 to 1677. Surat was replaced by Bombay as
the headquarters of the Company on the west
coast in 1687.
<br>
<br>
<b>South-eastern Coast :</b> Factories was
established at Masulipatam (1611) and
Armagaon near Pulicat (1626). In 1639 Francis
Day Armagaon near Pulicat (1626). In 1639
Francis Day obtained the site of Madras from
the Raja of Chandragiri with permission to build
a fortified factory, which was named Fort St.
George. Madras soon replaced Masulipatam as
the headquarter of the English on the
coromandal coast, and in 1658 all the English
settlement in eastern India (Bengal, Bihar and
Orissa) and the Coronmandal were placed
under the control of the president and council
of Fort St. George.
<br>
<br>
<b>Eastern India :</b> Factories were set up at
Hariharpur and Balasore in Orissa (1633), at
Hugli in 1651, followed by those at Patna, Dacca,
Kasimbazar in Bengal and Bihar. In 1690 a
factory was established at Sutanuti by Job
Charnock and the zamindari of the three villages
of Sutanuti, Kalikata and Govindpur was
acquired by the British (1698). These villages later
grew into the city of Calcutta. The factory at
Sutanuti was fortified in 1696 (the British used
the rebellion of Shobha Singh, a zamindar of
Burdwan as an excuse to do this) and this new
fortified settlement was named 'Fort William' in
1700. A council with a president for Fort
Willaim was created (Sir Charles Eyre was the
first president) and all settlements in Bengal,
Bihar and Orissa were placed under it (1700).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Anglo-Mughal Relations</i></strong></div>

The relations between the Mughals and the
English were marked by the desire to dominate
each other. Initially, Hugli was sacked and war
was declared on the Mughal emperor,
Aurangzeb, in 1686 by the English. The Mughals
retaliated by the capture of all English
settlements in Bengal (1687). The British began
hostile activities under Sir John Child on the west
coast, seizing Mughal ships and harasing haj
pilgrims. The Mughals retaliated by capturing
English factories all over the empire (1688-1689).
The British finally surrendered but were
pardoned by the emperor (1690) and were
granted a farman.
<br>
<br>
The farman of 1691 granted by Aurangzeb
exempted the Company from payment of
customs duties in Bengal in return for an annual
payment and a second one granted by Farukh
Siyar in 1717 confirmed the privileges of 1691
and extended them to Gujarat and the Deccan.
Problems of The Company at Home
The Company had to face several problems
at home. A rival company by a group of
merchants under Sir William Courten was
formed in 1635 and was granted a licence to
trade in the East by Charles 1. There was rivalry
between the two companies for a while which
was ended with their amalgamation in 1649. The
East India Company was transformed into a
joint-stock company by a charter of Cromwell
in 1657.
<br>
<br>
In 1694 the British Parliament passed a
resolution giving equal rights to all Englishmen
to trade in the East. A new rival company,
known as the 'English Company of Merchants
Trading to the East Indies' (1698) was formed,
which sent Sir William Norris as ambassador to
Aurangzeb to secure trading privileges for itself.
But Sir William failed in his mission. There was
ruinous competition between the two for a while
but they finally agreed to come together in 1702.
Their final amalgamation came in 1708 by the
award of the Earl of Goldolphin under the title
of 'the United Company of Merchants of
England Trading to the East Indies'. This new
company continued its existence till 1858.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FRENCH</i></strong></div>

The French East India Company was formed
by Colbert under state patronage in 1664. The
first French factory was established at Surat by
Francois Caron in 1668. Later Maracara set up
a factory at Masulipatam in 1669.
A small village was acquired from the
Muslim governor of Valikondapuram by Francois
Martin and Bellanger de Lespinay in 1673. The
village developed into Pondicherry and its first
governor was Francois Martin. Also
Chandernagore in Bengal was acquired from the
Mughal governor in 1690.
<br>
<br>
The French in India declined between 1706
and 1720 which led to the reconstitution of the
Company in 1720. The French power in India
was revived under Lenoir and Dumas
(governors) between 1720 and 1742. They
occupied Mahe in the Malabar, Yanam in
Coromandal (both in 1725) and Karikal in Tamil
Nadu (1739). The arrival of Dupleix as French
governor in India in 1742 saw the beginning of
Anglo French conflict (Carnatick wars) resulting
in their final defeat in India.
The Danes formed an East India Company
and arrived in India in 1616. They established
settlements at Tranquebar (in Tamil Nadu) in
1620 and at Serampore (Bengal) in 1676.
Serampore was their headquarters in India.
However, they failed to strengthen themselves
in India and were forced to sell all their
settlements in India to the British in 1845.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATURE AND CHARACTER
OF EUROPEAN COMMERCE</i></strong></div>

Role of European Companies Portuguese
The Portuguese seizure of power in the
Indian Ocean at the beginning of the 16th
century proceeded with amazing rapidity, and
for more than a century they remained lords of
the waters and sent many precious shiploads to
Lisbon. The armed control of the sea trade was
quite easy for the Portuguese, for they found a
flourishing and unprotected free trade system
when they entered this ocean. Except for an
occasional pirate, bearing rather primitive arms,
there was nobody in these waters who had made
it his business to sue force for the control of trade.
This prevailing free trade system of the India
Ocean, with all its flexibility, was nevertheless
very vulnerable. For this trade was not restricted
exclusively to luxury goods, like spices, precious
textiles, gold and ivory. Though they played a
major role in this trade, there was also
considerable division of labour in the course of
which some ports had become entirely
dependent of long-distance grain shipments. As
no duties and other protection costs distorted the
price level in this free trade system, everything
was much cheaper here than in the
Mediterranean where the Egyptians and the
Venetians operated a tight monopolgy.
<br>
<br>
What the Portuguese did was to protect the
Mediterranean practice in the Indian Ocean.
They were keen observers and quickly seized
upon the strategic points from which they could
control the vast network of Asian maritime
trade. Their fortified outposts served as customs
stations where Asian merchants had to acquire
cartazes (letters of protection) which saved them
from being attacked and ransacked by the
Portuguese on the High seas.
The Portuguese king soon made the spice
trade, particularly pepper trade, a royal
monopolgy. Their spice imports rose from less
than a quarter of a million pounds in 1501 to
more than 2.3 million pounds per year by 1505,
when Venetian merchants found that they could
buy barely one million pounds of spice in
Alexandria, though their annual purchase 1495
had been 3.5 million pounds. Arab and Veentian
merchants remained in the spice trade
throughout the centruy of Portuguese power in
Asia, but the balance of trade had shifted
dramatically, and the Portuguese persisted in
short-circuiting Arab middlemen carriers as the
European demand for spices continued to
increase.
<br>
<br>
The Portuguese king never wanted to
undersell the Venetians, a sthey had initially
suspected. He adjusted his sole price to the
Venetian once, while simultaneously forcing his
Indian suppliers to part with their pepper at a
cheap rate. For the royal monopolist it was an
ideal system; buy the pepper at a cheap fixed
rate in India and sell at a high fixed price in
Europe. Once this system was established, it was
very well suited for sub-contracting thus saving
the king trouble and giving him an assured
income.
A comparison of the Portuguese budget in
the years 1506 and 1518 shows a striking change
in the structure of state finance due to pepper
monopolgy. The income from pepper monopolgy
rose from 1,35,000 cruzados (one cruzado being
equal to 3.6 grams of gold) in 1506 to 3,00,000
cruzados in 1518. Though there was an increase
in other sources of income during the period, the
pepper monopolgy certainly dewarfed all other
sources. The enormous profit derived from this
monopolgy made their annual investment of
50,000 cruzados in it appear rather moderate.
Thus, the Portuguese got good value for money
in this respective.
<br>
<br>
Another source of income which became as
important to the Portuguese king as the pepper
monopolgy was the sale of the offices of captains
and customs collectors in the Indian Ocean
strongholds. The Portuguese collected customs
at Ormuz on the Persian Gulf and other place
around the Indian Ocean. The offices of those
who collected these customs were auctioned by
the king at short intervals, usually three years.
So this was another royal money estate which
yielded income without any risk. In this way the
king became a rent receiver rather than a royal
entrepreneur.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Dutch</i></strong></div>

The Dutch invaded the Indian Ocean with
dramatic speed at the beginning of the 17th
century, just as the Portuguese had done a
hundred years earlier. Several favourable
preconditions accounted for this Dutch success,
such as a good educational system, advancement
in science and technology, their ability to acquire
nautical information from the Portuguese,
existence of a huge merchant marine and easy
access to sufficient wood for shipbuilding.
Unlike the situation in Portugal, the Dutch
state had no hand in business, and the monopoly
which was granted to the Dutch East Indian
Company (VOC) referred to spices only.
Furthermore, monopoly control stopped once
the shipments reached Amsterdam, where the
goods were freely auctioned to the highest
bidder. These auctions provided a good idea of
what the market would take, and they also
helped to introduce new commodities, such as
textiles, which were not covered by any
monopoly.
<br>
<br>
Throughout the 17th century the Dutch
Company operated on a much larger scale than
its English counterpart. Nevertheless, the Dutch
were deeply concerned about British competition
and tried their best to outdo them. While fighting
against the domination of the seas by the
Spanish and the Portuguese, the Dutch laid
stress on the principle of freedom of the seas.
But as early as the second decade of the 17th
century they refused all other powers, including
the British, an access to the Indonesian Spice
Islands, because only in this way, they argued,
could they be compensated for the protection
they furnished.
While the Dutch zealously guarded their
territorial control in Indonesia at a very early
stage, they showed no such ambitions in India.
This was perhaps due to the fact that they
procured textiles to an increasing extent in India,
and these were not covered by a monopoly. The
textile trade which became more important to
the Dutch required methods of control other than
the physical occupation of area of production.
It was more important in this case tie down
producers and middlemen by means of credit
and advance and to organise the acquisition of
the right type of textiles which were popular
with customers abroad.
<br>
<br>
As a consequence of their adaptation to the
textile trade, the Dutch factories experienced a
great deal of structural change. Initially, such
factories were expected only to store goods for
the annual shipment; in due course, however,
they became centres whose influence extended
far into the interior of the country as they placed
orders, distributed patterns, granted and
supervised credit, etc. The Dutch, who had many
factories on India's east coast, were also
represented at the court of the Sultan of
Golconda whose realm was an important source
of textiles for them.
Thus, the Dutch used India, particularly
south India, as a major source for the purchase
of cotton cloth as well as of slaves for their spice
island plantations. Dutch investments in
Coromandal cloth, which would then be sold
for spices in Indonesia, proved a most profitable
way of diminishing the 'specie drain' (drain of
gold and silver bullion) from home. This
technique of 'triangular trade' was quickly
learned and followed by the English, who were
equally anxious to reduce the eastern flow of
bullion.
<br>
<br>
The Dutch invasion of the Indian Ocean
brought about a revolution in international trade
which the Portuguese had never accomplished.
The flow of commodities in the Mediterranean
was completely reversed. The trade of the Levant
(eastern) Mediterranean region), following is its
revival in the late 16th century; experienced a
sudden decline. West European ship now
supplied the ports of the Levant with the goods
which had been sent from there to the West only
a few years earlier. Venice suffered the same
decline, and was soon no more than a regional
port of Italy.
Asian maritime trade was not as immediately
affected by this trade revolution as the
Mediterranean trade was. There were great
Indian ship owners who dispatched so many
ships every year to the ports of Arabia of the
Persian gulf that they easily outnumbered all the
European ships in the Indian Ocean at that time.
The Dutch participated in this Indian Ocean
trade as well. Just as they were Europe's biggest
shipping agents, they now offered their services
to Asian merchants to an ever-increasing extent.
If these merchants did not have ships of their
own they were glad to entrust their goods to
European whose ships were armed and could
thus defend themselves against piracy.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>English</i></strong></div>

The English East India Company, founded
in London two years before the Dutch Company,
operated on much the same terms including sale
by auction. And in the East, from their premier
base at Surat, the English soon gained control
over the Arabian Sea and Persian Gulf,
destroying Portuguese power by seizing Ormuz
in 1622. Thereafter, Persian silk competed with
Gujarati calico as England's favourite textiles
from the East (calico was still used mostly for
household linens, table clothes and towels in
Britain and western Europe, becoming popular
for apparel only after 1660).
<br>
<br>
English annual imports of Indian calico
'pieces' (12 to 15 yards in length) jumped from
14,000 in 1619 to over 2,00,000 in 1625; the
demand for Persian silk grew less swiftly. Indigo
and saltpetre were the other major imports from
India, and the fact that both products were
produced in the eastern Gangetic plain,
especially in Bihar, stimulated British efforts to
establish factories on the east coast as well as
the west coast of the Indian subcontinent.
The English merchants, anxious to reduce the
eastern flow of their bullion, soon learned that
by investing their gold in south Indian weavers,
whose products could easily be sold in Indonesia
for spices, they were able to buy four times the
value of pepper and cloves for the same amount
of gold. Small wonder that their interest in
establishing a factory along the Coromandal
coast quickly intensified. From these ports in
south eastern India, they soon sought more
immediate access to the mainstream of produce
flowing down from the Gangetic plain to the Bay
of Bengal.
<br>
<br>
The factories of the English Company, like
those of the Dutch ones, experienced a similar
kind of structural change after their adaptation
to the textile trade. But, since the English had no
access to the spice Islands particularly after their
massacre by the Dutch at Amboyna in 1623, they
concentrated on India and on the textile trade
to an ever-increasing extent. Nonetheless, in the
17th century the English were still lagging behind
the Dutch even in this field.
European piracy increased in the Indian
Ocean as individual entrepreneurs were quick
to learn their nautical and commercial lessons.
However, not all of the European 'interlopers'
were pirates. Some of them simply earned a living
in the 'country trade, as the intra-Asian trade
was called. The British private traders were very
active in this field, and though the East India
Company officially decried the activities of these
interlopers (who crossed the Asian seas without
any respect for monopoly rights granted by royal
charter), there emerged a kind of symbiosis
between them and the Company. The Company
itself concentrated on intercontinental trade, and
the 'country traders' made their deals with the
servants of the company and made use of the
infrastructure and the protection network
provided by the company without contributing
to its maintenance. This gave them a
comparative advantage in the intra-Asian trade
and the Company did well in specialising in the
intercontinental connection and leaving the
'country trade' to others.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>French</i></strong></div>

Another major European power, which was
destined to play an important part in the history
of India in the 18th century, was still rather
insignificant in the Indian context of the late 17th
century. Colbert organised the French Company
on federal lines. But this was counter-productive,
because the Company was organised by the
government and there were no private
capitalists. Colbert had to persuade the big
dignitaries to subscribe funds for this purpose,
and whoever contributed did so only in order to
please the king.
<br>
<br>
The commercial success of the company was
more limited than the imperial vision of some of
its great officials, like governor Dupleix, Admiral
La Bourdonnais and General de Bussy. But after
its reorganisation in 1685, the company started
managing its trade with bureaucratic precision.
In peace time it could even make some profit,
although it was debarred from the lucrative
textile trade because of French mercantilist
policy. However, the frequent interruption of
this trade due to European wars drove the
Company to the verge of Bankruptcy. It was only
after the merger of the French West Indies
Company with the French East India Company
in 1719 that France caught up with the new
pattern of international trade, which linked
Indian Ocean trade with trans-Atlantic trade.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IMPACT OF EUROPEANS
ON INDIA'S FOREIGN TRADE</i></strong></div>

With the arrival of the Europeans,
particularly the Dutch and the English, there
was a tremendous increase in the demand for
Indian textiles for both the Asian markets and
later the European market. The Asian markets
for Indian textiles were developed over a long
period. There markets were extensive and
widespread and there was great diversity in their
demand. This intra-Asian trade in Indian textiles
seems to have operated in two ways. Firstly,
there was a bilateral trade between the
Coromandal and various parts of South East
Asia such as Malacca, Java and the Spice Islands.
In this trade, the Coromandal textiles acted as a
link in a multilateral trade, embracing the
Coromandal, South-East Asia, West Asia, and
the Mediterranean. In this trade, Coromandal
textiles were exchanged for South-East Asian
spices which were in turn meant for the West
Asian and Mediterranean markets. The
European market for Indian textiles actually
developed around the middle of the 17th
century, and thereafter it grew by leaps and
bounds.
<br>
<br>
The intra-Asian trade witnessed severe
competition among the various groups of
merchants, such as the Portuguese, the Dutch,
the English, the Danes, and the Indians
consisting of both the Moors and the Chettis,
whereas the European market for Indian textiles
was dominated entirely by the European
companies, particularly the English and the
Dutch, with the Indian merchants acting
essentially as middleman.
European participation in the foreign trade
of India showed a marked increase in the second
half of the 17th century. This increase can be
seen clearly in the sharp rise in their investments,
a large part of which was in textiles meant for
the Asian markets as well as the European
market. Though initially European investment
in Indian textiles considerably exceeded those
ordered for the European market, by the end of
the 17th century the situation was reversed with
two-thirds of it going for the European market
and only one third for the European market and
only one-third for the Asian market. Among the
various European companies competing for
Indian textiles, the main rivalry was between the
Dutch and the English, with the former initially
having an edge but the latter gradually gaining
supremacy by the turn of the 17th century and
the beginning of the 18th century.
With regard to the textile varieties that were
exported from the coromandal to South East
Asia and other Asian markets, and later to
Europe, the European records give us a very long
list. The various types, in order of importance,
were long-cloth, salempors, moris (chintz),
guinea-cloth, bethiles, allegias, sarassas, tapis,
and the like. All these varieties were being
exported even during earlier periods to several
Asian markets such as the Moluccan Spice
Islands,Java, Sumatra, Borneo, the alay
Peninsula, siam, Tenasserim, Pegu, Arakan,
Persia, Arabia, and the Red Sea ports. But the
specialty of the period under study was the
increased European orders which, though
matching the already existing varieties,
demanded measurements large than those in the
Asian markets. Consequently the Indian weavers
had to change their methods and their looms to
accommodate this European demand. Many of
them did so quite profitably, but it neccessitated
long-term contracts and rendered spot orders
improbable.
<br>
<br>
The Indian economy, more specifically its
textile trade and industry, during the second half
of the 17th century, was a seller' (i.e. producers')
market. For, when the three European
companies- English, Dutch and French (which
had entered the fray in the 1670s) were
competing in the open market, making large
orders from India, and these were supplemented
by European private trade and Indian trade, the
weavers had greater flexibility and large freedom
of operation. The interchangeability of goods
ordered by these various buyers, who were
aiming at broadly the same export market, made
it possible for weaver produced was bought up
by one or the other eager customers. If, for
instance, any cloth produced by the weaver was
rejected by the companies, then the weaver could
sell it to English private traders. This situation
existed in many parts of the country where the
three companies as well as the other buyers were
in free competition.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CHANGES IN THE
ORGANISATION OF TRADE</i></strong></div>

One important feature of the trade
organisation of India in the 17th and early 18th
centuries is that indigenous merchants were
generally mentioned in their individual capacity
rather than as part of a mercantile organisation,
an indication that the great merchant guilds of
the medieval period were fast declining.
Besides, the dividing line between
independent merchants and merchants acting
on behalf of the European companies was a very
thin one. In several cases, in fact, a merchant
functioned in both capacities. But the company
record specifically mention several indigenous
merchants as their rivals and competitors.
Many of the native merchants, however,
found that it was more profitable and less risky
to act on behalf of the companies rather than
make voyages on their own. In the organisational
set-up of the companies, their function was
fourfold; purchasing cloth for the company and
acting as a link between it and the weavers;
supervising weavers and minimising the
company's risk by taking on bad debts; ensuring
quality and timely delivery; and saving the
company the necessity of laying out vast sums
of money by making the initial advances
themselves.
<br>
<br>
With regard to the mercantile groups and
their activities, the Hindus as a whole continued
to dominate the commecial world of the
coronmandal-overseas and coastal trading,
wholesaling and retailing, brokerage, banking
and shroffing. Among Hindu merchants, the
most important were Telugu merchantile castes,
viz, the komatis and balijas (belonging to the
right hand faction- valankai), and beru chettis
(left hand faction- idankai). Prominent Hindu
individual merchants were asi Viranna (casa
Verona), Malaya and his brother Chinanna,
Narasimha Rama Chetti, Ben Rama Chetti,
Kesara Chetti, Seshadri; Varadappa and Koneri
Chetti.
<br>
<br>
Muslim merchants of the Coromandal,
indiscriminately referred to by the European as
Moors, shared the domination of the overseas
and coastal trade of the Coromandal with the
Hindu merchants. The so-called Moors consisted
of the Golconda Muslim merchants and the
Chulia merchants of south Coromandal, both of
whom had diverse ethnic origins. Other major
merchant groups in the coromandal were
Gujaratis and Armenians, who seem to have
made Coromandal their home. Among the
Muslim merchants, the most important
personalities were Mir Jmla, Khwaja Nizam, Mir
Kamal-ud-din, Mirza Muhammad, khwaja
Hassan Ali, Mir Qasar and Khwaja Araby. A
number of them had close political connections,
and enjoyed a good bargaining position in their
relations with the companies.
Indian merchant relationship with
Europeans tended to become institutionalised by
the beginning of the period under study, first in
the form of chief merchants and later in the socalled joint-stock companies of association of the
indigenous merchants, both of which had origins
in the medieval Indian commercial practices
though influenced and inspired by the European
commercial innovations. Both the institutions
were an outcome of the European need to put
the whole ordering and delivery process on a
firm and sturdy footing, and their desire to ensure
better maintenance of standards and greater
control over the suppliers.
In all the European settlements in India, there
evolved an office of chief merchant, held by one
of two of the most prominent merchants of the
settlement. This tendency to deal with one or two
strong and powerful individuals, was stronger
with one or two strong and powerful individuals,
instead of a large number of diverse merchants,
was stronger with the English than with the
Dutch, while the french fell some where in
between in this respect.
<br>
<br>
With regard to the merchant associations, all
the available evidence suggests that they first
came into existence in the 1660s in the Dutch
settlements in India with the initiative and
French companies companies followed suit, and
encouraged the Indian merchants to form such
associations in their settlements. These merchant
association, however, began to decline rapidly
as the 18th century advanced.
By the Very nature of things a certain group
of people, known as dalals (brokers) become
indispensable to the trade organisation of India
during this period, though broderage as an
established commercial practice and brokers as
a distinct commercial group existed in India
throughout the medieval period. The brokers
acted as a link between the producers,
wholesaler, retailers, and consumers. Besides the
primary job of procuring goods at cheaper rates
for their clients, they performed a variety of
functions. There was a hierarchical division
among the brokers, each one of them was an
important link in the over all set-up of
commercial organisation. As mentioned earlier,
most of the indigenous merchants of India
during this period belonged to the various
categories of broders.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BRITISH- FRENCH
MONOPOLISTIC AMBITIONS</i></strong></div>

In the beginning of the eighteenth century,
the English and the French were competing with
each other to establish their supremacy in India.
Both of them used the political turmoil prevalent
in India as a result of the decline of the Mughal
Empire in their favour and indulged in internal
politics. The Anglo-French rivalry in India was
manifest in the Carnatic region and in Bengal.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Carnatic Wars</i></strong></div>

The downfall of the Mughal Empire led to
the independence of Deccan under Nizam-ulMulk. The Carnatic region also formed part of
the Nizam's dominion. The ruler of the Carnatic
accepted the suzerainty of the Nizam. In 1740,
the Austrian War of Succession broke out in
Europe. In that war England and France were
in the opposite camps. They came into conflict
in India also. The French governor of
Pondicherry, Dupleix opened attack on the
English in 1746 and thus began the First Carnatic
War (1746-1748). The English sought help from
the Nawab of Carnatic, Anwar Uddin. But the
French concluded a treaty with his rival Chanda
Sahib. The English army crushed a defeat on the
French in the Battle of Adyar, near Madras. In
the meantime, the Treaty of Aix-la-Chappelle
was concluded in 1748 to end the Austrian
Succession War. Thus the First Carnatic War
came to an end. But the English and French
continued to take opposite sides in the internal
politics of India. This had resulted in the Second
Carnatic War (1749-1754). Dupleix supported
the cause of Muzafar Jang, who wanted to
become the Nizam of Hyderabad and Chanda
Sahib, an aspirant for the throne of Arcot. The
troops of these three defeated Anwar Uddin,
who was with the British in the First Carnatic
War, and killed him in the Battle of Ambur in
1749. After this victory, Muzafar Jung became
the Nizam and Chanda Sahib the Nawab of
Arcot. Muhammad Ali, son of Anwar Uddin
escaped to Tiruchirappalli. The English sent
troops in support of him. In the meantime, the
British commander Robert Clive captured Arcot.
He also inflicted a severe defeat on the French at
Kaveripakkam. Chanda Sahib was captured and
beheaded in Tanjore. Meanwhile Dupleix was
replaced by Godeheu as the French governor.
The war came to an end by the Treaty of
Pondicherry in 1754.
<br>
<br>
The outbreak of the Seven Years War (1756-
1763) in Europe led to the Third Carnatic War
(1758-1763). Count de Lally was the commander
of the French troops. The British General Sir Eyre
Coote defeated him at Wandiwash in 1760. In
the next year, Pondicherry was captured and
destroyed by the British troops. The Seven Years
War came to an end by the Treaty of Paris in
1763. The Third Carnatic War also ended. The
French agreed to confine its activities in
Pondicherry, Karaikkal, Mahe and Yenam. Thus
the Anglo-French rivalry came to a close with
British success and French failure.
The causes for the French failure can be
summed up as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Commercial and naval superiority of the
English.</li>
        <li>Lack of support from the French
government.</li>
        <li>French had support only in the Deccan
but the English had a strong base in
Bengal.</li>
        <li>English had three important ports -
Calcutta, Bombay and Madras but French
had only Pondicherry.</li>
        <li>Difference of opinion between the French
Generals.</li>
        <li>England's victory in the European wars
decided the destiny of the French in India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Establishment of British Power in Bengal
Bengal remained one of the fertile and
wealthy regions of India. The English
ascendancy in Bengal proved to be the basis for
the expansion of English rule in India. The
conflict between the Nawab of Bengal, Siraj-udDaula and the English led to the Battle of Plassey
held on 23 June 1757. Robert Clive, the
Commander of the British troops emerged
victorious by defeating the Nawab's army. The
easy English victory was due to the treachery of
Mir Jabar, the Commander of Nawab's army.
However, the victory of the British in the Battle
of Plassey marked the foundation of the British
rule in India.
<br>
<br>
In 1764, the English once again defeated the
combined forces of the Nawab of Oudh, the
Mughal Emperor and the Nawab of Bengal in
the Battle of Buxar. The English military
superiority was decisively established. In 1765,
Robert Clive was appointed as the Governor of
Bengal. In the same year, the Treaty of Allahabad
was concluded by which the Mughal Emperor
granted the Diwani rights to the English East
India Company. Thus the British power in India
was thoroughly established.
