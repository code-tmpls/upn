<h3>European Penetration and British Conquest</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Portuguese</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive
in India in 1498. The closing of the traditional
trade routes western Asia by the Ottomans and
rivalry with the Italian states, set Portugal in search
of an alternate sea route to India.</li>
        <li>The first successful voyage to India was by Vasco
da Gama on May 17, 1498, when he arrived in
Calicut, now in Kerala piloted by Abdul Majid
and was received by the Hindu king, Zamorin.</li>
        <li>Vasco da Gama visited India for a second time in
1502.</li>
        <li>The Portuguese established a chain of outposts along
the Indian west coast and on the island of Ceylon
in the early 16th century which were called Feitorias.</li>
        <li>In 1501, Portuguese established Cochin as their
first trading station in India, it was the early capital
of Portuguese in India.</li>
        <li>In 1505, Franchise De Almedia (1502-09) was sent
as first Portuguese governor to India to establish
Portuguese naval supremacy in this region.</li>
        <li>He was followed by Alfonso de Albuerque in 1509
who was the real founder of Portuguese power in
India. In 1510, Albuquerque captured Goa from
ruler of Bijapur, and also controlled over parts of
Rajouri and Dabhol thereby bringing Bijapur naval
trade at stand still. Albuquerque encouraged his
countrymen to marry Indian women and abolished
Sati.</li>
        <li>Nino-da-Cunha transferred the Portuguese capital
from Cochin to Goa in 1530 and acquired Diu in
1535 and Daman in 1559.</li>
        <li>The famous Jesuit Saint Francisco Xavier came to
India with the governor Martin Alfonso De Souza.</li>
        <li>The Portuguese power witnessed a decline by the
end of the 16th century as they lost Hugli in 1631
after being driven out by Qasim Khan, a Mughal
noble. They lost Hormuz in 1622 to the British.
The Marathas captured Salsette and Bassein in
1739. Ultimately the Portuguese were left only with
Goa, Daman and Diu, which they retained till
1961. The naval monopoly of Portuguese was
shattered by the Dutch.</li>
        <li>In 1661, the Portuguese king gave Bombay to
Charles II of England as dowry for marrying his
sister.</li>
        <li>The Portuguese made spice trade particularly
(pepper trade) a monopoly.</li>
        <li>The Portuguese had armed vessels plying in the
Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea.</li>
        <li>Ships carrying commodities which were not given
passes (cartage) by the Portuguese officials were
confiscated by them. The cartage was first issued
in 1502, which was available at their custom house.
The booty thus obtained yielded a sizeable source
of income which was again invested in trade. In
cartage, it was specifically mentioned that certain
items like pepper, horses, ginger, coir, ship, pitch,
sulphur, lead, saltpeter, cinnamon, etc. were not to
be loaded on others ships.</li>
