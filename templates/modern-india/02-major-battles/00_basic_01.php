<h3>Major Battles</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Carnatic Wars</i></strong></div>

Reminiscent of European hostilities of the eighteen
century, Anglo-French rivalry beginning with the
outbreak of the Austrian War of Succession and ending
with the conclusion of the Seven Years War, resonated
in India in the animosity between the English and the
French East India Companies; which issued the British
expansion in South India. The French settlement was
headquartered at Pondicherry with subordinate
factories at Masulipatnam, Karaikal, Mahe, Surat and
Chandernagore. The principal settlements of English
included Madras, Bombay and Calcutta.

    <ul>
        <li>The Anglo-French animosity in India ensued as a
sequel to the state of affairs in Europe with the
breakout of the Austrian War of Succession in
March 1740 in which the English and the French
were on opposite sides.</li>
        <li>This animosity was fuelled by the trading rivalry
of the companies which climaxed with the arrival
of Dupleix (who wanted to strengthen the French
position) as the French Governor of Pondicherry
in 1742.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Course/Events</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The English navy under Barnett took the offensive
and captured French ships. Dupleix, the French
Governor General, appealed to La Bourdonnais,
the French Governor of Mauritius (Isle of France)
for help and the latter responded with a squadron
of over 3000 men; defeating the English fleet, and
reaching the Coromandal coast on 7 July 1746.</li>
        <li>Madras besieged by the French both by land and
the sea capitulated to the French on 21st September
1746. However, it was restored to the English by La
Bourdonnais for a ransom of £ 4,00,000 without the
consent of Dupliex who later recaptured Madras
but was unsuccessful in capturing Fort St. David.</li>
        <li>The Battle of St. Thome, on the banks of the River
Adyar followed in which the French fought and
defeated the Indian forces of Anwar-ud-din, the
Nawab of Carnatic for the custody of Madras after
its reduction in 1746.</li>
        <li>The First Carnatic came to an end after the
conclusion of hostilities in Europe with signing of
the Treaty of Aix-La-Chappelle in 1848 which also
concluded the 18-month long siege over Fort St.
David.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Results</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Treaty of Aix-La-Chappelle that concluded
the war mandated the return of Madras back to
the English company in exchange of Louisburg in
North America to France.</li>
        <li>The First Carnatic war demonstrated the
importance of naval power in the Anglo-French
conflict and the superiority of the small,
welldisciplined and relatively modern European
army against the much larger, loose Indian civvies.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Second Carnatic War (1748-1754)</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Though the Anglo-French rivalry ended in Europe, it
continued in India; where encouraged by his success
against the Nawab’s forces, Dupleix sought to increase
his power and the French political influence in
Southern India by interfering in local dynastic disputes
in a bid to outmaneuver the English.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Causes</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On 21st May 1748 Subedar of Deccan i.e. the
Nizam of Hyderabad Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah
died, which resulted in a war of succession
between his second son Nasir Jang and the
Nizam’s grandson/the former’s nephew Muzaffar
Jang on the ground that he was appointed by the
Mughal Emperor as the Subedar of Deccan.</li>
        <li>In Carnatic, the right of Nawab Anwaruddin was
disputed by Chanda Sahib, son in law of former
Nawab Dost Ali.</li>
        <li>The two conflicts were merged into one and
alliances formed as Muzzaffar Jang and Chanda
Sahib joined under French support while Nasir
Jang and Anwaruddin aligned together with the
English help. Thus the disputes over the thrones
of Hyderabad and Carnatic became the cause of
the war.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Course/Events</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The combined armies of Muzaffar Jang, Chanda
Sahib and French defeated and killed Anwa
ruddin at the battle of Ambur near Vellore in
August 1749.</li>
        <li>Anwaruddin’s son Muhammad Ali fled to
Trichinopoly and Chanda Sahib became Nawab
of Carnatic while Muzaffar Jang became Subedar
of Deccan after the encounter death of Nasir Jung
in 1750.</li>
        <li>Dupleix was appointed Governor of all the Mughal
territories south of river Krishna. Some districts in
Northern Circars were also surrendered to the
French, including famous market town of
Masulipatam. In return Bussey with a French army
was stationed at Hyderabad.</li>
        <li>In 1750, the situation changed with the
appointment of Saunders as Madras Governor;
who decided to assist Muhammad Ali and on the
suggestion of Robert Clive, the British under the
former captured Arcot, the capital of Carnatic in a
bid to divert pressure on Trichinopoly in August
1751, successfully sustaining the siege for fifty
three days (September 23 to November 14) and
demoralizing the French.</li>
        <li>Subsequently, the British under Major Stringer
Lawrence relieved Trichinopoly defeating the
French forces and Chanda Sahib in Arni and
Kaveripakkam in 1752. Chanda Sahib was
treacherously killed by Raja of Tanjore.</li>
        <li>However, Dupleix not one to give up, won over
Morari Rao, the Maratha chief of Mysore and
secured the neutrality of Raja of Tanjore, thereby
renewing the siege of Trichinopoly in December
1752 which continued for more than one year,
both sides succeeding alternatively.</li>
        <li>Dupleix failure to capture Trichinopoly along with
his political ambitions and ruinous expenses
sealed his fate as he was recalled by the Directors
of French Company in 1754. With his recall the
second Carnatic war came to an end.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Results</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In August 1754, Godeheu replaced Dupleix as
Governor-General of French possessions in India
and reopened negotiations with the British;
concluding a provisional peace treaty - the Treaty
of Pondicherry in January 1755 according to which
each party was left in possession of the territories
that it actually occupied at the time of the treaty.
Thus, Godeheu and his incompetent Generals
Astru and Maisi lost those territories which
Dupleix had won.</li>
        <li>The English emerged victorious and Muhammad
Ali was appointed Nawab of Carnatic.</li>
        <li>In Hyderabad, the French General, Bussy maintained
a steady ascendency of the French with a grant of
the Northern Sarkars by Subedar Salabat Jung
(Muzaffar Jang had been killed in accidental
skirmish in Feb, 1751) consisting of the districts of
Mustafanagar, Ellore, Rajahmundry and Chicacole,
generating annual revenue of more than Rs 30 lakhs
to meet expense of maintaining the French army.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Third Carnatic War (1756-1763)</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Causes</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The third Carnatic war was an echo of the outbreak
of the Seven Years War in Europe and ended the short
peace between the European Companies in India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Course/Events</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1757, The British under Clive defeated Sirajuddaula and captured 
            Bengal. Clive and Watson
also won Chandernagar, the French possession in
Bengal, thus capacitating the British finances.</li>
        <li>The French government sent Count-de-Lally as the
Governor and Commander-in-Chief of the French
possessions in India, who soon after his arrival
attacked and captured Fort St. David in 1758. The
French military effort could not be sustained in
Tanjore and on Indian waters due to lack of naval
cooperation, shortage of finances and ammunition,
mutual distrust, etc.</li>
        <li>However, Lally continued to challenge the British
and called Bussy from Hyderabad, leaving the
French forces under the incompetent Commander
Corntla. Seizing the opportunity, Clive sent Colonel
Ford from Bengal to Northern Circars and
occupying Rajahmundry and Masulipatnam, the
English concluded a favourable treaty with Salabat
Jang, the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1759.</li>
        <li>The decisive battle of the third Carnatic War was
fought at Wandiwash on 22 January, 1760 where
Sir Eyre Coote defeated Lally.</li>
        <li>Bussy was taken prisoner; Lally retreated to
Pondicherry and signed a treaty with Haider Ali.
However, Pondicherry after a blocade of eight
months was surrendered to the English on 16
January, 1761. Mahe, Jinji were lost by French in
quick succession.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>The third Carnatic war came to an end in 1763
by the Treaty of Paris.</li>
        <li>Pondicherry, Karaikal and some other French
settlements were returned to the French by the
Treaty but these were never to be fortified.</li>
        <li>This sealed the French ambitions in India and
with the English conquest of Bengal and the
significant disposal of resources; it furthered the
growth of British power in Bengal.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Growth of British Power in Bengal</i></strong></div>

    <ul>
        <li>The first English factory in Bengal was established
at Hugli in 1651 under permission from Sultan

        <li>In 1689, the English obtained from Subedar
Azimus-Shan the zamindari of three villages
Sutanati, Kalikata and Govindpur, the present site
of Calcutta on payment of Rs. 1,200 to previous
proprietors.</li>
        <li>In 1700, Murshid Quli Khan was appointed Diwan
of Bengal and started administering as real ruler.</li>
        <li>There were three rebellions during Murshid Quli
Khan’s reign. First by Sitaram Ray, Uday Narayan
and Ghulam Mohammad. Second, by Shujat Khan
and third and last by Najat Khan.</li>
        <li>In 1705, Aurangzeb appointed Murshid Quli Khan
as Governor of Bengal and later placed Orissa
under his authority. He shifted his capital from
Dacca to Murshidabad and after Aurangzeb’s
death, founded an independent kingdom.</li>
        <li>Murshid Quli Khan was succeeded by his soninlaw Shuja-ud-daula Khan who added Bihar to
his dominions, where he appointed Alivardi Khan
as his deputy.</li>
        <li>In 1717, Emperor Farukhsiyar confirmed the trade
privileges granted by earlier Subedar of Bengal,
besides according permission to the company to
rent additional territory around Calcutta.
• Shuja died in 1739 and was succeeded by his son

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On Alivardi Khan’s death in 1756, Siraj-ud-daula,
his grandson became the Nawab of Bengal at 24.
Soon after his accession to the throne, the Nawab
came into conflicts with the English in Bengal.</li>
        <li>Siraj prevented the English from fortifying Fort
William. However the English refused to stop the
new fortification which prompted the Nawab to
attack their factory at Cassim Bazar.</li>
        <li>The Nawab captured Fort William, taking 146
Englishmen prisoners. Holed up in a very small
room 123 died on 20th June, 1756 out of suffocation
and only 23 survived. English historians describe
this incident as the Black Hole Tragedy.</li>
        <li>This incident instigated the English at Chennai to
send a relieving force under Robert Clive alongwith
Admiral Watson to Bengal. And Clive entered into
a conspiracy with Mir jafar, the Commander-inChief of Siraj-ud-daulah.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Course/Events</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Clive marched towards Plassey on 23rd June, 1757;
which was near the Nawab’s capital of
Murshidabad.</li>
        <li>As agreed earlier, Mir Jafar, the Commander-inchief
of Siraj-ud-daula did not take up arms against the
English army and on the other hand the Nawab’s
soldiers fled from the battlefield.</li>
        <li>Later the Nawab was killed by Miran, Mir Jafar’s
son and the latter was made the Nawab of Bengal
as promised by Clive.</li>
        <li>The conspirators against Siraj, besides Mir Jafar
included Manick Chand, the office-in-charge of
Calcutta, Amichand, a rich merchant, Jagat Seth,
the biggest banker of Bengal and Khadim Khan,
who commanded a large number of the Nawab’s
troops.</li>
        <li>Mir Madan and Mohan Lal, loyal to the Nawab
fought bravely but were killed due to treachery of
Mir Jafar and Rai Durlabh.</li>

</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Results</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The battle of Plassey was merely a skirmish but in
its results was one of the most decisive battles in
Indian history as it paved the way for the
foundation of the English rule in India.</li>
        <li>The English acquired a large sum of money from
the new Nawab - the first installment of wealth
paid to the Company being a sum of £ 8,00,000, all
paid in coined selve. Jafar granted the English,
zamindari of 24 Parganas and a personal gift of
2,34,000 pound to Clive.</li>
        <li>Mir Jafar became a puppet in the hands of Clive
and could not satisfy the demands of the English.
He was forced to resign in 1760.</li>
        <li>His son-in-law, Mir Kasim succeeded him but in
due course of time he too failed to satisfy the
growing demands of the English to
English Empire.</li>

        <li>Mir Kasim was a young, energetic and ambitious
ruler. Wanting to be independent he shifted his
capital to Monghyr, a place far away from Calcutta.
He also employed foreign experts to train his army.</li>
        <li>Mir Qasim took a drastic step to abolish all inland
duties, thus placing the Indian merchants on the
same as the English. The English decided to
overthrow him and war broke out between Mir
Kasim and the Company in 1763.</li>
        <li>Mir Qasim escaped to Oudh to organise a
confederacy with Shuja-ud-daula, the Nawab of
Oudh and the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II in
a final bid to oust the English from Bengal. The
Combined armies of the three powers numbering
between 40,000 to 60,000 met the English army of
7,072 troops commanded by Major Munro in the
battle of Buxar on October 22, 1764.</li>

        <li>Clive was sent out to India as Governor and
Commander-in-Chief of the British possession in
Bengal in 1765 and he made political settlements
with Shuja-ud-Daula of Awadh and Emperor Shah
Alam II concluding the Treaty of Allahabad (16
August 1765) which ended the Battle of Buxar.</li>
        <li>By the Treaty Shuja-ud-Daulah was confirmed in
his possessions on the following conditions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Nawab surrendered Allahabad and Kara
to Emperor Shah Alam;</li>
        <li> He agreed to pay Rs. 50 lakh to the Company
as war indemnity;</li>
        <li>He confirmed Balwant Singh, Zamindar of
Benares in full possession of his estate;</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
While also being forced to maintain English troops
for the defence of the state.
</li>
        <li>Fugitive Emperor Shah Alam was taken under the
Company’s protection and was to reside at
Allahabad where he was assigned Allahabad and
Kara ceded by the Nawab of Awadh. The Emperor
in turn issued a firman on 12 Aug 1765 granting
to the Company in perpetuity the Diwani of
Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in return for the Company
making an annual payment of Rs. 26 lakhs to him
and providing for expenses of Nizamat of said
provinces which was fixed at Rs. 53 lakhs.</li>
        <li>The Battle of Buxar made the English virtually the
masters of Bengal as it also proved their military
superiority and unchallenged power.</li>
        <li>As a result of his success in Bengal, Robert Clive
was appointed the first Governor General of Bengal
and he consolidated the British power both in
Bengal and in the Deccan.</li>
        <li>The Company acquired Diwani functions from
Emperor Shah Alam II (12th August 1765) and
Nizamat functions from Subedar of Bengal.
For the exercise of Diwani functions, the company
appointed two Deputy Diwans, Mohammad Reza
Khan for Bengal and Raja Shitab Roy for Bihar.
Md. Reza Khan acted as deputy Nizam. This
arrangement was known as Dual Government
wherein the administration of Bengal was carried
out by two heads with the Nawab of Bengal being
the nominal head and the Company, as the Diwan
controlled the revenue as well as police and judicial
powers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In time, the Company authorities in England
stopped sending money from England to purchase
Indian goods, instead they purchased goods from
revenues of Bengal and sold them abroad. Clive
compelled servants of the Company to sign ‘covenants’
prohibiting acceptance of presents and forbade
‘servants’ of the Company from indulging in private
trade and made payment of internal duties obligatory.
A Society of Trade was formed in August 1765 with
monopoly of trade in salt, betelnut and tobacco, but he
abolished it in January1765. Clive issued an order
with effect from 1st January 1766 according to which
double allowance would be paid only to officers on
service outside frontiers of Bengal and Bihar.

extended his territories by conquering many areas
in South India including Bidnur, Sunda, Sera,
Canara, and Malabar to gain access to Indian

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Maratha Wars</i></strong></div>

The Third Battle of Panipat fought between Ahmad
Shah Abdali and the Marathas on 14th January 1762
weakened the Maratha power.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>First Maratha War (1775-1782)</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Causes</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>After the third Battle of Panipat, the fourth Peshwa
Madhaw Rao had reorganised the Maratha power
under him. However, after his death in 1772
internal dissensions among Marathas left them
weakened.</li>
        <li>His younger brother, Peshwa Narayan Rao
succumbed to the intrigues of his ambitious uncle
Raghunath Rao, another claimant for the gaddi.</li>
        <li>Raghunath Rao was opposed by a strong party at
Poona under Nana Phadnavis who proclaimed
Narayan Rao’s posthumous son as Peshwa.</li>
        <li>This drove Raghunath Rao to point of desperation
and he signed Treaty of Surat (1775) with Bombay
Government hoping to gain the gaddi with the
help of English subsidiary troops. By this Treaty,
Raghunath agreed to hand over the islands of
Salsette and Bassein to the English in return for
their help to get Peshwaship.</li>
        <li>However, this was done without the knowledge of
Warren Hastings, the Governor-General of Bengal
and the supreme head of the English in India,
who rejected the treaty.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Course/Events</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Thus the English were involved in a long drawn war
with the Marathas which lasted from 1775 to 1782.</li>
        <li>In the beginning, the Marathas defeated British at
Talegaon and forced them to sign convention of
Wadgaon by which English renounced all their
conquest and gave up the cause of Raghunath Rao.</li>
        <li>Nana Phadnavis signed the Treaty of Purandhar
in 1776 with the English, raised his position and
defeated Raghunath Rao.</li>
        <li>But then all Maratha Chiefs were united behind
Peshwa and his Chief Minister Nana Phadnavis
while on the other hand, the British were led by
Governor-General Warren Hastings.</li>
        <li>A British force under Goddar marched across
Central India and after series of victorious
engagement reached Ahmedabad which he
captured in 1780.</li>
        <li>Mahadji Scindhia did not want confrontation with
British and Treaty of Salbai was signed in 1782 by
which status quo was maintained, was ratified by
Nana Phadnavis in 1785. This ended the war and
gave the British respite from Maratha menace.</li>

    </ul>

lakh rupees a year.</li>

    <ul>
        <li>Nana Phadnavis died in March 1800 “with him”,
remarked Colonel Palmer “departed all wisdom
and moderation of the Maratha Government.”</li>
        <li>Maratha Empire at this time consisted of
confederation of five big chiefs, Peshwa at Poona,
Gaikwad at Baroda, Scindhia at Gwalior, Holkar
at Indore and Bhonsle at Nagpur, Peshwa being
nominal head. After Nana Phadnavis’ death war
broke out among the Maratha chiefs.</li>
        <li>Yashwant Rao Holkar vs Daulat Rao Scindhia
and Peshwa Baji Rao II on other side were locked
in a mortal combat and in April 1801. Peshwa
brutally murdered Vithuji, the brother of Jaswant
Rao Holkar.</li>
        <li>On 25th October 1802, on the occasion of Diwali
day, Jaswant Rao Holkar defeated the combined
armies of Peshwa and Scindhia at Hadaspar near
Poona, placing Vinayak Rao, son of Amrit Rao on
the gaddi of Peshwa.</li>
        <li>Peshwa approached Wellesley for help thereby
providing the British, the much wanted
opportunity to intervene and accepted the
subsidiary alliance and signed the treaty of Bassein
on 31st December 1802.</li>
        <li>The Peshwa agreed to receive from the Company
a permanent regular Native Infantry stationed in
his territories, to cede in perpetuity territories
yielding an income of Rs 26 lakhs. The territories
surrenderd were in Gujarat, South of Tapti,
between Tapti and Narmada and some Territory
near Tungabhadra. He also surrendered Surat and
agreed to give up all claims of Chauth on Nizam’s
dominions and agreed not to resort to arms against
Gaikwad.</li>

armies to a stand- still and inflicted heavy losses
on Lord Lake who unsuccessfully attempted to
storm his fort.</li>
        <li>Wellesley was called back from India. It was Sir
George Barlow who concluded with Holkar the
treaty of Rajpurghat (25th Dec 1805) whereby the
Maratha Chief gave up all claims to places North
of Chambal, Bundelkhand and over Peshwa and
other allies of the Company while the latter got

Sindh in the 18th Century was ruled by Kallora
Chiefs. In 1783, Mir Fateh Ali Khan leader of Talpura
established complete hold over Sind and Kallora prince
was exiled. When Fath Ali Khan died in 1800, brothers
popularly known as ‘Char Yar’ divided the kingdoms
among themselves calling themselves Amirs or Lords
of Sind. The Amirs extended dominion on all sides,
took Amarkot from Raja of Jodhpur, Karachi from chief
of Luz, Shikarpur and Bukkar from Afghans and
established three branches with head-quarters at
Hyderabad, Khairpur and Mirpur.
Early relations between Sindh and the British
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In 1775, East India Company had established
factories at Thatta and had commercial relations
with Sindh which were abandoned in 1792 due to
political unrest.</li>
        <li>Fear of the French design prompted Lord Minto to
send British mission to Kabul, Persia, Lahore and
Sind and a treaty of ‘eternal friendship’ was signed
with the Amirs in 1809 providing for mutual
intercourse through envoys, and Amirs promised
not to allow the French to settle in Sindh.</li>
        <li>The Treaty was renewed in 1820 with an additional
article which excluded Americans from Sindh.</li>
        <li>Punjab under Ranjit Singh became powerful and
planned to conquer Sindh, with this intention met
Lord William Bentinck in 1831 at Ropar with
proposal of jointly conquering Sindh and dividing
it between them but, Bentinck refused it.</li>
        <li>In pursuance of commercial motives in 1831,
Alexander Burnes under order from Lord
Ellenborough was sent to explore Indus under
pretence of carrying presents to Ranjit Singh at
Lahore.</li>
        <li>In 1832, William Bentinck sent Col. Pottinger to
Sindh to sign a new commercial treaty with Amirs
and Lieutenant Del Host was sent to survey course
of Lower Indus.</li>
        <li>Terms of treaty signed between Pottinger and Amirs
of Sindh were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A free passage for English travellers for merchants
through Sind for use of Indus for commercial
pursuits;</li>
        <li>No English merchant was to settle in Sindh,
travellers and visitors were required to have
Passports;</li>
        <li>Tariff rates were to be announced and no military
dues or toll be demanded and tariffs could be
altered if high;</li>
        <li>Amirs to put down border robbers of Cutch in
concert with Raja of Jodhpur;</li>
        <li>Old treaties of friendship were confirmed.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Details of tariff rates were settled by a
supplementary commercial treaty of 1834. Colonel
Pottinger was stationed as the Company’s political
agent in Sind.</li>
<li>Pottinger was sent to Hyderabad to negotiate a
new Subsidiary Treaty in 1838 by which Amirs
accepted mediation in their dispute with Sikhs
and secondly accepted a British Resident at
Hyderabad who could move freely.</li>
<li>Auckland brought Ranjit Singh, Shah Shuja and
Amirs to sign a tripartite treaty in June 1838
whereby Ranjit Singh accepted British mediation
for his disputes with Amirs and Shah Shija agreed
to relinquish his sovereign rights on Sindh against
receiving arrears of tribute.</li>
<li>Under threat of superior military force of British,
Amirs accepted a treaty in February 1839 by which
British subsidiary force was to be stationed at
Shikarpur and Bukkar and Amir of Sind to pay Rs
3 lakh annually for its maintenance.</li>
<li>Amirs were not to negotiate with foreign states
without the Company’s knowledge, were to provide
a store room at Karachi for military purposes
abolish all tolls on Indus and furnish an auxillary
for Afghan war it needed. The British, in turn,
were not to meddle in internal affair of Sindh.</li>
<li>The Amirs even helped the British in the Afghan
War (1839 - 1842).</li>

        <li>Conquest of Sindh was result of growing AngloRussian rivalry in Europe, to counter Russia,
British Government decided to increase its
influence in Afghanistan and Persia.</li>
        <li>This policy could be successful if Sindh was under
British control. Commercial possibilities were an
additional attraction.</li>
        <li>In 1842, Lord Ellenborough succeeded Auckland as
Governor-General, he made plan to annex Sindh.
To regain prestige of English, suffered in Afghan War.</li>
        <li>In September 1842, Sir Charles Napier replaced
Major Outram as Company’s Resident at Sind with
full civil and military authority and was placed in
charge of all the troops of upper and lower Sind.</li>
        <li>He got the pretext when Amir Rustum of Khairpur
was charged with entering into a secret offensive
and defensive alliance against the Company.</li>
        <li>As a punishment, Lord Ellenborough imposed a
new treaty on the Amirs in 1843 and Outram was
sent to negotiate the details. By this treaty, the
Amirs were required to cede important territories
like Karachi, Thatta, Bhakkar, Rohri in lieu of
tribute to provide fuel to steamers of Company
navigating the Indus and surrender right of coining
money.</li>
        <li>A dispute of succession rose at Khairpur which
gave Napier the opportunity to interfere. Napier
supported claims of Ali Murad, brother of old Mir
Rustum, in preference to Mir Rustum’s son whom
he had abdicated and taken to flight.</li>
        <li>Napier prior to Treaty of 1843 had destroyed the
