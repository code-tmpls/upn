<h3>British Politics</h3>


The British conquest had a pronounced and
profound economic impact on India. There was hardly
any aspect of the Indian economy that was not changed
during the entire period of British rule down to 1947.
The economic politics followed by the British led to
rapid transformation of Indian economy into colonial
economy whose nature and structure were determined
by the needs of the British economy.
The British conquerors were entirely different from
previous ones. They totally disrupted the traditional
structure of Indian economy. Moreover, they never
became integral part of Indian life. They always
remained foreigners in the land, exploiting Indian
resources, carrying away Indian wealth, as a tribute.
Through laws, administrative, economic and fiscal
policies, the British government in England and
companies administration in India used their powers
for the advantage of British manufacturers and to
detriment of India´s socio-political and economic fabric.
The gradual "development of underdevelopment"
has been traced through three stages of British
colonialism. R.P. Dutt in his classic work "India Today"
has made a brilliant analysis of Indian colonial
economy and delineated three phases of British
colonialism and economic exploration of India:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Period of Merchant Capital (Mercantilism)-from
1757 to the end of 18th century.</li>
        <li>Period of Industrial Capital (Free Trade
Capitalism)-developed during the 19th century and;</li>
        <li>Period of Finance Capital-from the closing decades
of 19th century to 1947.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mercantilist Phase</i></strong></div>

From 1757 (the British victory in the battle of Plassey)
the East India Company completely monopolised trade
and began the direct plunder of Indian wealth. This
was the phase of buccaneering capitalism whereby
wealth flowed out of the barrel of trader's guns with
which they could impose their own prices which had
no relation to the cost of production. Twin aims of the
merchant companies were: to have a favourable balance
of trade and to promote flow of bullion into the home
country. The Merchant Companies aimed at large profit
margin.
<br>
<br>
This could be possible through three methods:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Monopoly control over trade and elimination
of all possible rivals.</li>
        <li>Purchase of goods at cheap rates and sale of
commodities at very high rates.</li>
        <li>The above objectives could be achieved if they
could establish political control over the
countries they traded with.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


The Company used its political power to dictate terms
to weavers of Bengal who forced to sell their products at
a cheap and dictated price. Many of them were compelled
by the Company to work for them and were forbidden to
work for Indian merchants. The servants of the Company
monopolised the sale of raw cotton and made the Bengal
weaver pay exorbitant prices for it.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Period of Industrial Capital</i></strong></div>

The real blow to Indian handicrafts fell after 1813,
when Indians lost not only the foreign markets but
markets in India also. Thus India entered the second
phase of colonialism, the Industrial Phase (1813 - 1858).
India was thrown open for exploration at the hands
of British mercantile industrial capitalist class. The
Industrial Revolution in Britain completely transformed
Britain's economy and its economic relationship with
India. The British now took away raw materials and
brought back manufactured goods for being marketed
in India. Imports of British cotton goods alone increased
from 1,000000 pounds in 1813 to 6,300000 pounds in
1856. The doors of India were open to foreign trade
but the Indian products had to compete with British
products with heavy import duties on entry into
Britain. Indian sugar had to pay on entry into Britain
a duty that was over 3 times its cost price.
In some cases, the duties went as high as 400%.
India was now forced to export raw materials instead
of exporting manufactured goods. Thus the Indian
exports consisted of raw cotton, jute, silk, oilseeds,
wheat indigo and tea. After 1813, all policy was guided
by the needs of British industry.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Finance Capital</i></strong></div>

This was coterminous with emergence of the phase
of Finance Capitalism in Britain. It began after 1860.
The rebellion of 1857 was the key factor in change of
the nature of the colonialism. British capital penetrated
into India in diverse economic fields in the latter half
of the 19th century but tightened its tentacles over
India in 20th century in form of finance capital. Finance
capital became the new most powerful mode of colonial
exploitation. Forms of Investment were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Loans raised in England by the Secretary of State
on behalf of Indian Government and by semi -
public organisation mostly for investment in
railways, irrigation, development of ports, hydro
electric projects, etc.</li>
        <li>Foreign business investment in India.
It has been estimated that before 1914, nearly 97%
of British capital investment in India were diverted
towards completion of economic overheads (mainly
railways road transport, merchant, shipping, etc)
mining industry (coal and gold mines) development of
financial houses (banking, finance, insurance etc)
towards promotion of auxiliaries calculated to fuller
commercial exploitation of India's natural resources.
British capital went into activities that were
complementary to British industries and was in no
way planned for industrial development of India.
British capitalist retained a dominant control over
Indian banking, commerce, exchange and insurance
and with their capital resources and official patronage
dominated industrial sectors in Indian economy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economic Impact</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Drain of Wealth</i></strong></div>
        
The constant flow of wealth from India to England
for which India did not get an adequate economic,
commercial or material return has been described by
Indian national leaders and economists as 'drain of
wealth' from India. The drain of wealth was
interpreted as an indirect tribute extracted by imperial
Britain from India year after year. The drain of wealth
was first cited by Dadabhai Naoroji etc. which was
later expanded by R.P. Dutt, Bipan Chnadra and others.
Dadabhai Nauroji brought it to light in his book titled
"Poverty and Un-British Rule in India."
Concept of Economic Drain: In the mercantilist
concept an economic drain takes place if gold and
silver flow out of the country as a consequence of an
adverse balance of trade. In the 50 years before the
battle of Plassey (1757), the East India Company had
imported bullion worth £ 20 million into India to
balance the exports over imports from India. As there
was a flourishing market for Indian cotton and silk
outside, while demand for western products were low.
British mercantilists were highly critical of the trade
policies of the Company. Even the British government
adopted a series of measures to restrict or prohibit the
import of Indian textiles into England. Apart from
other measures in 1720, the British government forbade
the wear or use of Indian silk and calicoes in England
on pay of a penalty of £ 5 for each offence on the
wearer and of £ 20 on the seller.
<br>
<br>
After Plassey the situation was reversed and the
drain of wealth took an outward turn as England
gradually acquired monopolistic control over the
Indian economy. After the East India Company
extended its territorial aggression in India and began
to administer territories and acquired control over the
surplus revenues of India, the shape of drain
underwent a change. Henceforth, the Company had a
recurring surplus which accrued from a) profits from
oppressive land revenue policy; b) profits from its trade
resulting from monopolistic control over Indian market
and c) exactions made by Company officials. The entire
surplus was used by Company as an 'investment' i.e.
for making purchases of exportable items in India and
elsewhere. Again the export of goods made out of this
was ´investment´ India did not get anything in return.
This system was brought to an end by the Charter Act
of 1813 when territorial and commercial revenues of
the Company were separated.
<br>
<br>
From 1813 onwards economic drain took the form
of unrequited export. Barring a few exceptional years
favourable balance of trade had been the normal feature
of our foreign trade till the outbreak of World War II.
The focal point of the Drain Theory was that a
portion of the national product of India was not
available for consumption for her people or for capital
formation but was being drained away to England for
political reasons and India did not get an adequate
economic return.
Constituents of Economic Drain: The first
constituent of economic drain was Home Charges,
which were as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The costs of Secretary of State's India Office
(previously the cost of East India Company's
London establishment)</li>
        <li>India's debt in England (caused by East India
Company military adventures, the cost of
suppressing the Mutiny of 1857 and the
compensation to the Company's shareholders).</li>
        <li>Home charges also included pensions to the British
Indian officials and army officers, military and
other stores purchased in England, cost of army
training, transport and campaigns outside India,
guaranteed interests on railways.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>Economic Consequences of the Drain:</b> Dadabhai
Nauroji described the drain of wealth as the "evil of all
evils" and the main cause of Indian poverty. He
maintained that Britain was "bleeding India White"
Comparing the plundering raids of medieval rulers
'with, the British methods of colonial plunder, another
critic' has pointed out that the old time plunder had
to restrict itself to richmen´s houses and godowns
where wealth was accumulated. It was not worthwhile
ransacking every little hut and little village. In contrast
the colonial plunder could reach the most lowly, the
most humble and most remote. Thus, British methods
of exploitation though less painful were more thorough
and resembled the blood sucking leeches.
The drain of wealth checked and retarded capital
accumulation in India, thereby retarding the
industrialization of India. Indian products and treasure
drained to England without adequate returns was of
great help in creating conditions in that country
conducive for the growth of British factory industry in
early stages of industrial revolution.
What is worse is that part of the British capital
entered India as Finance Capital and further drained
India of her wealth. Dutt lamented that moisture raised
from Indian soil under colonial rule descended as
fertilizing rain largely on England and not India.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Deindustrialization</i></strong></div>
        
During the first half of the 19th century or even
upto 1880, India´s economy witnessed a strange
phenomenon. While western countries were
experiencing industrialization, India suffered a period
of industrial decline. This process has been described
as 'deindustrialization'.
<br>
<br>
There was a sudden and quick collapse of the urban
handicrafts which had for centuries made India's name
a byword in the markets of entire civilized world. The
collapse was caused largely by competition with
cheaper imported machine-goods from Britain. The
British imposed a policy of one way free trade on
India after 1813 and the invasion of British
manufactures, in particular cotton textiles immediately
followed. The ruin of Indian industries, particularly
rural artisan industries proceeded even more rapidly
once the railways were built.
The railways enabled British manufacturers to reach
and uproot the traditional industries in the remotest
villages of the country. The ruin of Indian handicrafts
was reflected in the ruin of the towns and cities which
were famous for their manufacture. The tragedy was
heightened by the fact that the decay of the traditional
industries was not accompanied by the growth of modern
machine industries as was the case in Britain and
Western Europe. The gradual destruction of rural craft
broke up the union between agriculture and domestic
industry in the countryside and thus contributed to the
destruction of self sufficient village economy. Thus the
British conquest led to the deindustrialization of the
country and increased dependence of the people on
agriculture. This increasing pressure on agriculture was
one of the major causes of the extreme poverty of India
under British rule.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commercialisation of Agriculture</i></strong></div>
        
In the latter half of the 19th century another
significant trend in Indian agriculture was the
emergence of the commercialization of agriculture. So
far agriculture had been a way of life rather than a
business enterprise. Now agriculture began to be
influenced by commercial considerations i.e. certain
specialised crops began to be grown not for
consumption in the village but for sale in the national
and even international markets. Commercial crops like
cotton, jute, groundnut, oilseeds, sugarcane, tobacco
etc. were more remunerative than food grains.
Again the cultivation of crops like spices, fruits,
vegetables could cater to a wider market perhaps the
commercialization trend reached the highest level of
development in the plantation industry i.e. tea, coffee,
rubber, etc. which were all produced for sale in a
wider market.
<br>
<br>
A number of factors encouraged specialization and
commercialization of new market trend such as the
spread of money economy, the replacement of custom
and tradition by competition and contract led to the
growth of internal and external trade, the emergence
of a united national market (facilitated by expansion
of railways and road transport) and the boost to
international trade given by entry of British Finance
Capital etc. were also important.

        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social & Economic Effects</i></strong></div>

Commercialization was an artificial and forced
process which led to differentiation without genuine
growth. To meet excessive land revenue demand of the
state and high rates of interest charged by the money
lender the cultivator perforce had to rush a part of his
harvest into market and sell it at whatever price it
fetched. Many poor cultivators had to buy back after
six months a part of crop they had sold away at low
prices at harvest time. The precise pattern of
commercialization varied from crop to crop and from
region to region. Tea required plantations directly
managed by whites using indentured labour nearing
slavery. Indigo was mainly cultivated by peasants,
forced into their cultivation via forced advances by the
sahib planters. No coercion was needed for jute in
East Bengal.
<br>
<br>
British business houses had a near total control
over overseas trade, shipping and insurance. Hence
the bulk of the profits that accrued from the export
boom of 1850s were appropriated by foreign business
firms. These profits were a part of foreign leakages in
the Drain of wealth.
Further Indian agriculture began to be influenced
by widely fluctuating world prices. The cotton boom
of the 1860s pushed up the prices but mostly benefited
the host of intermediaries while the slump in prices in
1866 hit the cultivator the most - bringing in its turn
heavy indebtedness, famine and agrarian riots in the
Deccan of the 1870´s. Thus, the cultivator hardly
emerged better from the new commercialization.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Transport and Communication</i></strong></div>

With British rule, came modern means of transport
like railways, buses and steamship and communication
- telegraph. They were essential instruments for colonial
management and control of vast alien territories. It
was in the logic of colonialism that the empire was
well knit by a vast network of roads and railways so
as to ensure that colonial goods could penetrate the
remotest village in India and swiftly transport the
instruments of coercion and control to trouble spots
thereby ensuring the vast tracts it controlled would
remain subjugated for perpetuity.
<br>
<br>
It had the added benefit of supporting the newly
developing modern industries of iron, steam engines,
coal etc. and of being an investment area of the excess
capital accumulated in Britain which needed an outlet
for investment in the new era of Finance Capital. British
Capitalists wanted to introduce the railways to facilitate
their machine made goods.
Lord Dalhousie initiated a programme of wide
railway construction in India. In his famous Minute
on Railways, he defined the economic reason behind
the construction. The first railway line running from
Bombay to Thane was opened to traffic in 1953. By
1905 nearly 45000 kms of railways had been built. The
entire amount of 350 crores invested in them was
provided by the British investors. The railway lines
were laid primarily to satisfy the interest of the British.
Several railway lines in Burma and North-West India
were built at high cost to serve the British imperial
interest.
<br>
<br>
The British also established an efficient and modern
postal system and introduced the postage stamps.
Railways and other modern means of transport played
extremely important role in the destruction of self
sufficient economy of the villages and the propagation
of the ideas of freedom movement. It is a fact that with
the coming of the railways ancillary industries did not
develop in India. Only about 700 locomotives were
indigenously produced in the entire British period.
By 1921, only 10% of the superior posts in the
railways were manned by Indians. So the diffusion of
new skills remained slim. Thus we see that means of
transport and communication developed strictly to suit
the purpose of colonial interests.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Modern Industries</i></strong></div>

An important development in the second half of
the 19th century was the establishment of large scale
machine based industries in India. The British rulers
of India did not conceive of an industrialized India.
However, compulsions of maintaining imperial control
over the country and its thorough economic
exploitation led Britain to construct roads, railways,
posts and telegraph lines, develop ports, irrigation
works, banking, exchange and insurance facilities etc.
developments which provided the material basis for
beginning of modern industry in India.
The machine age in India started when cotton textile,
jute and mining industries were started in the 1850s.
The first textile mill was started in Bombay by Cowasjee
Nanabhoy in 1853 and first jute mill in Rishra (Bengal)
in 1855. These industries expanded slowly but
continuously.
<br>
<br>
Most of the modern Indian industries were owned
or controlled by British capital. Foreign capitalists were
attracted to Indian industry by the prospects of high
profits. Labour was extremely cheap; raw materials
were readily and cheaply available; for many goods,
India and its neighbours provided a ready market. For
many Indian products, such as tea, jute and
manganese, there was a ready demand the world over.
On the other hand, profitable investment opportunities
at home were getting fewer. At the same time, the
colonial government and officials were willing to
provide all help and show all favours.
Traditional business communities flourished
mainly as moneylenders or dependent traders serving
as agents of British export-import firms in the interior.
The firm of Tarachand-Ghansyamdas acted as the
agents of Shaw and Wallace. Moreover, Government
followed a conscious policy of favouring foreign capital
as against Indian capital.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Jute Industries</i></strong></div>

Demand for hemp, traditionally used in the West
for rope, sail canvas and sacking, greatly increased
with the growth of international commerce. Till 1870
Dundee had an almost complete monopoly of the
world's factory made jute cloth trade based on cheap
Indian jute. In 1855 George Auckland started the first
modern jute spinning factory in Rishra, Bengal which
initially spun only yarn which was sold to local
handloom weavers. By 1870s jute gunny bags and
clothes penetrated foreign markets, leading to massive
exports of finished jute products. The Indian Jute Mills
Association (IJMA) was formed in 1884 to cope with
the problems of over production and excess capacity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cotton Textiles</i></strong></div>

Whereas the jute industry was dominated by
foreigners, the cotton industry was essentially Indian
in origin, largely controlled by Indian investors mainly
in Bombay and a little later, at Ahmedabad.
The first steam powered mill was started near
Calcutta by English-men in 1817, while 2 Frenchmen
in 1830 set up a spinning mill in Pondicherry. In 1853
James Landen set up a spinning mill in Broach. These
did not trigger off any development. Its rapid
expansion only began after 1870.
<br>
<br>
In 1854, Cowasjee Nanabhoy Davar floated a
spinning Company with a capital of Rs. 50,000 which
was the first indigenous mill. By 1861 the first mill was
opened in Ahmedabad and later the Bombay merchants
financed mills in Surat and Kanpur. The great expansion
began after the 1870s. British mills tended to specialize
in spinning yarn or weaving cloth, while Indian mills
did both. These mills quickly found foreign outlets in
the Middle East and East Asian markets.
During the Swadeshi movement, boycott of
Manchester goods led to expansion in Bombay. The
Banga Lakshmi cotton mill was launched with much
fanfare in August, 1906. The Bombay Mill Owners
Association was founded in 1875. Parsis played the
most important role in the Bombay Textile industry,
but Europeans, Hindus, Muslims and Jews were also
active. By 1895, at least 57% of all technical and
administrative posts were held by Indians.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Iron and Steel</i></strong></div>

In the 1820´s an Englishman named Health started
a firm to produce Iron and Steel at Porto Novo, with
the aid of the East India Company which was a failure,
and was dissolved in 1874. It sought to produce
charcoal iron. In 1874 the Bengal Iron works Company
was formed but was shut down in 1879. The
Government of India operated it as a public enterprise
till 1889. In 1889 the Bengal Iron and Steel Company
(BISCO) was incorporated in England.
J.N. Tata started TISCO, which was registered in
1907 with a nominal capital of Rs. 25,175,000 entire
amount being subscribed by 8000 Indians in 3 weeks.
In 1924, Tata Iron and Steel Company received a
Government subsidy and protection at the rate of
33·33%.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Land Revenue System</i></strong></div>

The British imperial rulers of India unleashed for
reaching changes in Indian agrarian structure. New
land tenures, new land ownership concepts, tenancy
charges etc. were extended to farmers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Permanent Settlement in Bengal</i></strong></div>

Cornwallis' introduced permanent settlement in
1793 which declared zamindars as proprietors of the
soil and fixed demand for their perpetuity: the
government would promise never to increase it in
future.
<br>
<br>
<b>Effects of the Permanent Settlement:</b> It may seem
that the settlement was greatly in favour of the
zamindars but they were also now obliged to pay a
fixed amount by fixed dates every year, and any failure
on their part meant the sale of the zamindari.
Furthermore, many of the zamindaris were rated for
large sums that left no margin for shorfalls due to
flood, drought or other calamity. As a result, many
zamindars had their zamindaris taken away and sold
in the decades immediately after the permanent
settlement.
<br>
<br>
However, many zamindars still found it difficult to
pay the amount demanded by the British. One such
zamindar, the Raja of Burdwan then divided most of
his estate into ´lots of fractions called patni taluqs´
Each such unit was permanently rented to a holder
called patnidar, who promised to pay a fixed rent. If
he did not pay, his patni could be taken away and
sold. Other zamindars also resorted to this: thus a
process of sub-infeudation commenced.
Maximum powers were given to zamindars to
ensure revenue collection. Regulation Act of 1793
without using the court could seize movable property
in case of default.
<br>
<br>
In pre-British India recovery of loans was not a
legal right of the money-lender. It was instead a moral
obligation of the debtor. British regulations
strengthened the money lenders hand through a) Civil
Procedure Code of 1859 b) Limitation of 1859 imposed
a three year limit on realization of debt


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ryotwari System</i></strong></div>

Meanwhile, Munro and Read introduced the
Ryotwari system. Under this system every registered
holder of land is recognised as the proprietor of the
land and is held responsible for direct payment of
land revenue to the state. He has the right to sub-let
his landholdings- to transfer, mortgage or sell it. He is
not evicted from his holdings by the Government so
long as he pays the state demand of land revenue.
Accountable Situations: The factors responsible for
Ryotwari System were as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It was believed that Ryotwari System was the
original system.</li>
        <li>Maximization of revenue necessitated negation of
intermediaries and direct collection.</li>
        <li>With Permanent Settlement there was a loss of
revenue in the future.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mahalwari System</i></strong></div>
 
Mahalwari system was developed by Holt
Mackenzie. Under this system the taluqdars and
zamindars were originally appointed by the state, and
the real owner of villages was zamindars who lived in
them or constituted the village community. This
required that Government officials should record all
the rights of cultivators, zamindars and others, and
also fix the amounts payable from every piece of land,
demand of land revenue village by village or mahal by
mahal and collection through village headman or
lambardar.
<br>
<br>
The system broke down because of the excessive
state demand and harshness in its working and
collection of land revenue.
