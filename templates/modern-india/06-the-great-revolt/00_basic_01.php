<h3>The Great Revolt of 1857</h3>



The revolt of 1857 was though a regional
manifestation yet the causes and the events that
instigated the revolt were surely having a Pan-Indian
characteristic. In fact, the revolt of 1857 was the
outburst of people's feelings against, social, economic
and political exploitation and hence participants from
almost every field i.e. social, economical (represented
by peasants) and political (deposed rulers) participated
in the revolt.
<br>
<br>
Prior to this revolt also, the resentment of the Indians
were expressed in both violent mutinies as well as
peaceful protests. The mutiny at Vellore (1806), at
Barrackpore (1824), at Ferozpur (1842), mutiny of the
7th Bengal cavalry, mutiny of 22nd N.I. in 1849, Revolt
of the Santhals (1855-56), Kol uprising (1831-32) etc.
were among the high degree of protests by the people
that culminated in the revolt of 1857.
Causes of Revolt
<br>
<br>
Following were the causes of the great revolt
of 1857:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Causes:</i></strong></div>    
        
The English Company's policy of 'effective control'
and gradual extinction of the Indian Native States
was facilitated by the subsidiary alliance system that
culminated with the 'Doctrine of Lapse' of Dalhousie.
While the Punjab, Pegu, Sikkim had been annexed by
the 'Right of Conquest', Satara, Nagpur, Jhansi,
Udaipur, Sambhalpur, Baghat and Jaitpur were
annexed by Dalhousie's doctrine of lapse policy. The
pretext of 'good governance' was adopted for the
annexation of Awadh.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, the announcement of the Lord Canning,
that the successors of Faqir-ud-Din would have to
leave and renounce regal title and ancestral Mughal
Palace (Lal Quila) had grievously hurted the Muslim
sentiments who thought that the English wanted to
destroy the house of Timur.
The 'absentee sovereignty ship' of the British rule
in India also worked against the British that disbanded
the Pindaries, Thugs and irregular soldiers forming
the bulk of native armies that transformed as rebels in
the revolt of 1857.</li>
        <li>
            
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Administrative and Economic Causes:</i></strong></div>
        
The annexation of Indian states deprived the native
aristocracy of power and position. The new
administrative set-up tended to reserve all high posts,
civil and military to the Europeans. The chances of
promotion to the Indians appointed to these services
were few.
<br>
<br>
Moreover, the administrative machinery of the
English Company was inefficient and insufficient. The
land revenue policy was equally unpopular. Many
Taluqdars, the hereditary landlords, were deprived of
their position and gains. Large estates were confiscated
and sold by public auction. The Inam Commission,
appointed in 1852 in Bombay, alone confiscated as
many as 20,000 estates. The Taluqdars of Awadh were
the hardest hit.
<br>
<br>
Peasants were forced to leave their agricultural land
due to rise in revenue, the handicrafts and industry
workers were forced to earn livelihood through beggary.
The economic policies worked against the traditional
Indian handicrafts and industry. The ruined Indian
industry and trade increased the pressure on agriculture
and land which lopsided development in turn resulted
in the pauperization of the country in general.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social and Religious Causes:</i></strong></div>    
        
The English were infected with a spirit of racialism.
They described the Hindus as barbarian with hardly
any trace of culture or civilization, while Muslims
were dubbed as bigots, cruel and faithless.
The Religious Disability Act of 1850 modified
Hindu customs; a change of religion did not debar a
son from inheriting the property of his father. The
rumour was that the English were conspiring to convert
the Indians to Christianity. Sepoys were promised
promotions if they accepted the 'true faith'.
<br>
<br>
Idolatry was renounced and Hindus were dubbed
as ignorant and superstitious. The activities of Christian priests and efforts of Dalhousie and Betheme towards women education made Indians feel that
through education the British were going to conquer
their civilization and so these education offices were
styled on 'Saitani Daftars'. Moreover, the abolition of
Sati, child marriage etc. were seen as an intrusion into
the age-old tradition of the land.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Military Causes:</i></strong></div>     
        
The ratio of Indians in the British army was much
higher than the Europeans. This disproportion took a
more serious turn because of the shortage of good
officers in the army; most of them were employed on
administrative posts in the newly annexed states and
the frontiers.
<br>
<br>
Indian portion of the English army consisted mostly
of Brahmans and Rajputs. Moreover, most of them
came from Awadh and Bihar, hence the political and
social developments of the region equally affected them.
The extension of British dominion in India adversely
affected the service conditions of the army. They were
required to serve in areas far away from their homes
without any extra payment or Bhatta and it was this
reason that led to the refusal of Bengal regiment in
1844 to move to Sindh.
<br>
<br>
In 1856, Canning passed the General Service
Enlistment Act which feared that all future recruits for
the Bengal Army would have to give an undertaking
to serve anywhere as desired by the government.
Also, the the Post Office Act of 1854, withdrew the
privilege of free postage so long enjoyed by the Sepoys.
Moreover, the disaster of the British Army in Crimean
War favoured the idea of a revolt which was triggered
with the introduction of greased cartridge of the newly
replaced Enfield rifle. The greased cartridge contained
the fat of pig and cow prepared at wool rich arsenal.
This was considered by the Sepoys as a deliberate
move to defame their religion.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Spread of the Revolt</i></strong></div>

On 29th March, 1857, the Brahmin sepoy, Mangal
Pandey of Barrackpore refused to use the greased
cartridge and fired at his adjutant. The 34 Native
Infantry was disbanded and sepoys guilty of rebellion
were punished. In May 1857, 85 sepoys of 3rd cavalry
at Meerut rebelled but were imprisoned. Their fellow
Sepoys broke out an open rebellion on 10th May and
shot their officer and headed towards Delhi. General
Hewitt, the commanding officer at Meerut found
himself helpless to stem the rising tide. On 12 May
1857, the rebels seized Delhi and overcame Lieutenant
Willoughby, the incharge of the Delhi. Bahadur ShahII was proclaimed the Emperor of India. Very soon the
rebellion spread throughout Northern and Central
India at Lucknow, Allahabad, Kanpur, Bareilly,
Banaras, Jhansi, parts of Bihar and other places.
Unfortunately, a majority of Indian rulers remained
loyal to the British and the educated Indians and
merchants' class kept themselves aloof from the rebels.
Revolt was confined to North India only.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Spread of the Revolt</i></strong></div>

<b>Delhi:</b> A rebellion was led by Bakht Khan. In
September 1857, Delhi was recaptured by the English
under John Nicholson. The emperor was arrested and
his two sons and grandsons were publicly shot by
Lieutenant Hudson himself.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kanpur:</b> Nana Saheb was the leader at Kanpur.

Saheb was joined by Tantia Tope. Sir Campbell
occupied Kanpur on December 6th. Tantia Tope
escaped and joined Rani of Jhansi.
<br>
<br>
<b>Lucknow:</b> Rebellion was led by Begum Hazrat
Mahal and Ahmaddullah. Henry Lawrence and other
Europeans at the British residency were killed by the

and even disorderly boys.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of the Revolt</i></strong></div>

The revolt of 1857 made it clear that the techniques
of administering India must change in order to fully
achieve the colonial goal. Hence, there were major
changes in the policies of the rulers in almost every
field-political, economical, social, religious and
military.
<br>
<br>
Following were the impact of the revolt of 1857 on
Indian polity and society:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>By the Government of India Act 1858, the control of
Indian administration was transferred to the Crown
from the Company. Though the Crown had
considerable influence over Company's policies
through the Board of Control from 1784, the Act of
1858 ended the dualism of control and made the
Crown directly responsible to Indian affairs. A
Secretary of State of India was appointed who was
to be assisted by an advisory council of 5 members,
out of which 8 members were to be nominated by
the Crown. In India, the same sort of GovernorGeneral and the same military and civil services
continued as before. No new policy was
inaugurated; rather a continuation of the Company's
policies was reiterated.</li>
        <li>The policy of extension of territorial possession
ended and it was promised "to respect the rights,
dignity and honour of Native Princes as their own".
As these Native Princes acted as 'break waters', to
preserve them became of a cardinal principle of
British policy. General amnesty was granted to all
the offenders, except those involved in killing of
English and Europeans. Taluqdars of Awadh were
confirmed in their estates subject to the promise of
loyalty and future good behaviour.</li>
        <li>The 1858 proclamation assured the free & impartial
admission to offices under Crown without any
discrimination of race or creed, provided the Indians
qualified for them by their education, ability &
integrity. This was manifested in the Indian Civil
Service Act of 1861, which provided for an annual
competitive examination to be held in London.</li>
        <li>Indian-British army was thoroughly reorganised
and built on the policy of division and
counterpoise. The Army Amalgamation Scheme of
1861 transferred the Company's European troops
to the service of the Crown. 'Linked-Battalion
Scheme' was started in the army. All big posts in
the army and artillery departments were reserved
for the Europeans. The ratio of Indian and
European soldiers in the army was increased in
the favour of the latter. The policy of counterpoise
of a native against native was followed.</li>
        <li>It was increasingly realised that one basic cause
for the revolt of 1857 was the lack of contact
between the ruler and the ruled. It was believed
that this would at least acquaint the rulers with
the sentiments and feelings of the Indian and those
provide an opportunity for evidence of
misunderstandings. The Indian Councils Act of
1861 was a humble beginning in that way.</li>
        <li>The English attitude towards the religious and
social aspects of India changed. They now tried to
follow a policy of non-interference in the religoius
and social sphere of Indians which had caused
resentment among them.</li>
        <li>The unity of Hindus and Muslims during the
revolt was thought problematic to the smooth
working of British policies, hence the policy of
'divide and rule' was applied. Muslims were now
considered as 'friends' of the English while the
Hindus were denounced.</li>
        <li>Racial bitterness was aggravated. The entire
structure of the Indian government was remodeled
on the philosophy of white man's burden and
civilizing role of English in India was applied.</li>
        <li>The era of territorial aggrandizement gave place to
the era of economic exploitation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nature of Revolt</i></strong></div>

Scholars have held divergent views about the nature
of the revolt of 1857. British scholars like Kaye,
Trevelyan, Lawrence in addition to many eye witnesses
like Munshi Jiwan Lal, Durgadas Bandopadhya, Syed
Ahmad Khan etc. have held that it was 'a mutiny'.
Other described it as a 'racial struggle'. Still others
doubt it as a clash of civilization, while the nationalists
call it as the first War of Indian Independence.
Following are the major views of scholars.
John Lawrence and Seeley thought it to be a Sepoy's
mutiny. John Seeley describes the revolt as a 'wholly
unpatriotic and selfish Sepoy mutiny with non active
leadership and no popular support'. Though it is true
that it began as a military rising, yet it was not
everywhere confined to the army. Even the army as a
whole did not join it and a considerable section fought
on the side of the government. In fact, the rebels came
from almost every section of the population. In the
trials of 1858-59, thousands of civilians, along with
the soldiers, were held guilty of the rebellion and were
punished.
<br>
<br>
The views of L.E.R. Rees that the revolt was 'a war
of fanatic religionists against Christians' is also erring.
During the heat of the rebellions, the ethical principles
underlying the various religions had little influence
on the complaints. Both sides quoted their religious
scriptures to cover their cases over the other party.
Though the Christians fought the war and won it, but
not Christianity.
It was also not a 'war of races'. True, all the whites
in India, whatever their nationality, were ranged on
one side, but not all the blacks. Leaving the noncombatants out of account, there was a high proportion
of Indian soldiers in the Company's army that took part
in the suppression of the rebellion. To be more correct,
it was a war between the black rebels on one side and
the white ruler supported by blacks on the other side.
T.R. Holmes held that it was 'a conflict between
civilization and barbarism'. The explanation smacks
of narrow racialism. During the rebellion both the
Europeans and the Indians were guilty of excess. Infact,
vendettas took the better of men on both sides. No
nation or individual which indulges in such horrible
atrocities can claim to be civilized.
Sir James Outram and W. Tayler described the
outbreak as the result of Hindu-Muslim conspiracy.
Outram held that 'it was a Mohammedan conspiracy
making capital of Hindu grievances'.
Early national leaders like V.D. Savarkar in his
book, 'The Indian War of Independence', to arouse
national consciousness, described it as 'a planned war
of national independence'. Later on, national leaders
further developed them to cite it as a shining example
of the perfect accord and harmony between the Hindus
and the Muslims.
<br>
<br>
Dr. R.C. Majumdar and Dr. S.N. Sen agree that the
uprising of 1857 was not the result of a careful
planning nor were there any masterminds behind it.
The mere fact that Nana Saheb went to Lucknow and
Ambala in March-April 1857 and the struggle started
in May of the same year cannot be regarded as an
evidence of planning. During the trial of Bahadur Shah,
efforts were made to prove that he was a party to a
pre-planned conspiracy. Infact, the course of trial made
it clear that the uprising was as much surprise to
Bahadur Shah as to the British.
Also, both of them agree that the Indian nationalism
in the middle of the 19th century was in an embroynic
stage. India, at that time was not a nation and the
leaders of the rebellion were no national leaders.
Bahadur Shah was no national king. Infact, self
motivation and profit worked as an energizer to the
rebel leaders. Different groups participated in the revolt
because of reasons. The Taluqdars of Awadh fought for
their feudal privileges. Attitudes of the leaders were
mutually jealous. The condition of the masses was no
better. The majority of the people remained apathetic
and neutral.
<br>
<br>
In his book 'the Sepoy Mutiny and the Revolt of
1857', R.C. Majumdar argued that the uprising of 1857
was not a war of independence. He maintained that
the revolt took different aspects in different regions.
Somewhere it was a Sepoy mutiny joined later by
disgruntled elements eager to take advantage of
anarchy, somewhere it was a Sepoy mutiny followed
by a general revolt in which, civilians, disposed rulers,
tenants and other took part. He also contends that the
Sepoys were mostly inspired by the desire of material
gains than any political or even religious contradiction.
However, he concedes that ultimately these all gave
birth to nationalism.
On the contrary, Dr. Sen believes it to be a war of
independence by arguing that revolutions are mostly
the work of a minority, with or without the active
sympathy of the masses. He contends that when a
rebellion can claim the sympathies of the substantial
majority of the population, it can claim a national
character.
<br>
<br>
Dr. S.B. Chaudhari, in his book 'Civil Rebellions in
the Indian Mutiny 1857-1859' has confined his
attention to the detailed analysis of the civil rebellions
which accompanied the military insurrection of 1857.
He maintains that the revolt of 1857 can be bifurcated
into mutiny and rebellion and the outburst of 1857
was the coming together of two series of disturbances.
Lala Lajpat Rai in 'Young India' has described the
revolt of 1857 as both political as well national.
Subhash Chandra Bose also conceded that it was not
merely a Sepoy mutiny but a national uprising.
Eric Stokes believes that in rural areas the revolt was
essentially elitist in character. The mass of the population,
appear to have played little part in the fighting or at most
timely followed the local leadership. According to them,
it was basically an unarmed rebellion.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Sepoy Mutiness</i></strong></div>

1764 : A battalion of Munro's army at the
battlefield of Buxar deserted to Mir Kasim.
1806 : Mutiny at Vellore in protest against
interference in the social and religious
practices of the sepoys.The sepoy
unfurled the flag of the ruler of Mysore.
1824 : 47th Native infantry unit mutinied when
ordered to proceed to Burma without
adequate overseas allowance.
1825 : The Grenadeir Company in Assam
mutinied.
1838 : An Indian regiment at Sholapur mutinied
for non payment of full batta.
1844 : 34 N.I. and 64th regiment joined by some
others refused to proceed to Sindh without
old pecuniary benefits.
1849-50 : There was mutinious spirit in the
company's army during occupation in
the Punjab. The regiment at Govindgarh
mutinied in 1850.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Failure of the Revolt</i></strong></div>

The revolt of 1857 was regional in character and
poorly organized. India south of the Narmada
remained unaffected. Sindh and Rajasthan remained
quiet and Nepal's help proved of great avail in
suppressing the revolt.
This revolt was mainly feudal in character carrying
with it some nationalistic elements. The feudal elements
of Awadh, Rohilkhand and some other parts of
northern India led the rebellion, other feudal princes
like the Rajas of Patiala, Gwalior etc. helped in its
suppression. These Indian princess were amply
rewarded after the suppression of the rebellion.
The revolt was organised poorly. The leader of the
rebellion though undoubtely brave, lacked experience,
organizing ability and concerted operations. There was
no planning and almost all factions acted their own
strategy. Surprise attacks and guerilla tactics could
not get them their lost independence against the much
organised European based English army.
<br>
<br>
The military resources of the British Empire were
far superior to those of the rebels. Though a year earlier,
the British army was busy in Crimean War and fought
on other fronts in the World, but by 1857-58 most of
the wars were won by the British. The Indian soldiers
had very few guns and muskets and mostly fought
with swords and spears. On the other hand, the
English army was equipped with the latest weapons
of war like the Enfield rifle. Also, the new mode of
communication like telegraph and railways played a
major part in favour of the English.
The rebels had no common ideal. Bahadur Shah-II
was declared the Emperor at Delhi, Nana Saheb was
proclaimed as Peshwa at Kanpur and Gwalior. HinduMuslim differences lay dormant against the common
enemy, but were not dead. The peasants and the
inferior castes, apart from the educated class and
traders, had no active sympathies with the rebels.
Points to Remember

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The revolt was basically anti-imperialist and both
the sepoys and the civilians wanted to throw out
the imperial rulers.</li>
        <li>In 1856 the government decided to replace the old
fashioned musket 'Brown Bess' by the 'Enfield
rifle'. The training of the new weapon was to be
imparted at Dum Dum, Ambala and Sialkot.</li>
        <li>On March 29, 1857 the sepoys at Barrackpore
refused to use the greased cartridge and one
Brahmin sepoy, Mangal Pandey, attacked and fired
at the adjutant.</li>
        <li>On 10th May, 1857, the sepoys of the 3rd cavalry
at Meerut also refused to use the greased cartridge
and broke out in open rebellion. They were
immediately joined by the 11th and 20th Native
infantries.</li>
        <li>On May 12, 1857, Delhi was seized and Mughal
emperor Bahadur Shah-II was proclaimed the
emperor of India. The real command was in the
hands of Bakht Khan who had led the revolt at
Bareilly and brought the troops to Delhi.</li>
        <li>In Kanpur the revolt was led by Nana Saheb, who
proclaimed himself the Peshwa. He was assisted
by Tantia Tope. The Rebels defeated General
Windham outside Kanpur. Azimullah Khan also
led at Kanpur.</li>
        <li>In Lucknow Begum Hazrat Mahal and
Ahmadullah led the revolt. Hazrat Mahal
proclaimed Brijis Kadr as the nawab of Awadh
against the wishes of the British. Henery Lawrence,
the British resident was killed.</li>
        <li>In Jhansi, Rani Laxmibai assumed the leadership
of the mutiny.</li>
        <li>In Bareilly Khan Bahadur proclaimed himself as
the Nawab and revolted there.</li>
        <li>In Arrah Kunwar Singh led the revolt.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
