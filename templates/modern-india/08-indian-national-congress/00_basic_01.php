<h3>Indian National Congress</h3>



The credit for giving the idea concrete and final
shape goes to A. O. Hume, a retired English Civil
Servant. He got in touch with prominent Indian leaders
and organised with their cooperation the first session
of the Indian National Congress at Gokul Singh Tejpal
Sanskrit School, Bombay in Decemeber 1885. It was
presided over by W.C. Banerjee and attended by 72
delegates. The aims of the National Congress were
declared to be the promotion of friendly relations
between nationalist political workers from different
parts of the country. Hence, the sessions of the Indian
National Congress were rotated with the President being
from a different region. In 1890, Kadambini Ganguli,
the first woman graduate of Calcutta University,
addressed the Congress session. The Indian National
Congress was not the only channel through which the
stream of nationalism flowed. Provincial conferences,
provincial and local associations, and nationalist
newspapers were the other prominent organs of the
growing nationalist movement. The press, in particular,
was a powerful factor in developing nationalist opinion
and the nationalist movement. Of course, most of the
newspapers of the period were not carried on as
business ventures but were consciously started as
organs of nationalist activity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Phase of National Movement</i></strong></div>

A retrospective examination of the national
movement suggest three broad stages in its
development:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>1885-1905: The Moderate phase of the period of
early nationalist Movement. In this phase the vision
of the Indian national Movement Congress was
dim, vague and confused. The movement was
confined to a handful of the educated middle class
intelligentsia who drew inspiration from western
liberal and radical thought.</li>
        <li>1905-1918: The Extremist phase or the period of
militant nationalists. During the second stage the
Congress came of age and its aim and scope were
considerably, extended. It aimed at an all round
development of the people-social, cultural,
economic and political 'swaraj' or government was
the goal of political front. Some progressive
elements within the congress adopted western
revolutionary methods to liquidate western
Imperialism.</li>
        <li>1919 - 1947: The Gandhian phase or the Final stage:
It was dominated by the objective of 'Poorna
Swaraj' or complete independence to be achieved
under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi by the
characteristically Indian method of non-violence
and non-cooperation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Moderates</i></strong></div>

The National leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Firoz
Shah Mehta, M.E. Wacha, W.C. Banerjee, S.N. Banerjee,
who dominated during this period were staunch
believers in liberalism and moderate politics and came
to be known as moderates. The moderates believed in
the constitutional agitation. They believed if public
opinion was created and organised and popular
demands presented to the authorities through petitions,
meetings resolutions and speeches, the authorities
would concede these demands gradually and step by
step. The moderates believed a that the British people
and Parliament wanted to be just to India but they did
not know the true state of affairs there.
Agitation against Economic Policies
The early nationalists complained of India's growing
poverty and economic backwardness and the failure of
modern industry and agriculture to grow; and they put
the blame on British economic exploitation of India.
They organised a powerful agitation against nearly all
important official economic policies based on this
colonial structure. They took note of all the three forms
of contemporary colonial economic exploitation, namely,
through trade, industry and finance. They clearly
grasped that the essence of British economic
imperialism lay in the subordination of the Indian
economy to the British economy.
<br>
<br>
They vehemently opposed the British attempt to
develop in India the basic characteristics of a colonial
economy namely, the transformation of India into a
supplier of raw materials, a market for British
manufacturers, and a field of investment for foreign
capital. Dadabhai Naoroji declared as early as 1881
that the British rule was "an everlasting, increasing and
everday increasing foreign invasion" that was "utterly,
though gradually, destroying the country". They
popularised the idea of swadeshi or the use of Indian
goods, and the boycott of British goods as a means of
promoting Indian industries. Students in Poona and in
other towns of Maharashtra publicly burnt foreign
clothes in 1896 as part of the larger swadeshi campaign.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitutional Reforms</i></strong></div>

Their immediate demands were extremely
moderate. They hoped to win freedom through gradual
steps. They were also extremely cautious, lest the
Government suppress their activities. From 1885 to
1892 they demanded the expansion and reform of the
Legislative councils.
<br>
<br>
The British Government was forced by their
agitation to pass the Indian Councils Act of 1892. By
this Act the number of members of the imperial
Legislative Council as well as the provincial councils
was increased. Some of these members could be elected
indirectly by Indians, but the officials' majority
remained. The nationalists were totally dissatisfied
with the Act of 1892 and declared it to be a hoax.
By the beginning of the 20th century, the nationalist
leaders advanced further and put forward the claim
for swarajya of self-government within the British
Empire on the model of self-governing colonies like
Australia and Canada. This demand was made from
the Congress platform by Gokhale in 1905 and by
Dadabhai Naoroji in 1906.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Administrative and other Reforms</i></strong></div>

The most important administrative reform they
desired was Indianisation of the higher grades of the
administrative services. They put forward this demand
on economic, political and moral grounds. Economically,
the European monopoly of higher services was harmful
on two grounds:- (1) Europeans were paid at very high
rates and this made Indian administration very costly
- Indians of similar qualifications could be employed
on lower salaries; and (2) Europeans sent out of India
a large part of their salaries and their pensions were
paid in England. This added to the drain of wealth
from India. Politically, the nationalists hoped that the
Indianisation of these services would make the
administration more responsive to Indian needs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Defence of Civil Rights</i></strong></div>

Politically conscious India had been powerfully
attracted not only to democracy but also to modern
civil rights, namely, the freedom of speech, the Press,
thought and association. They put up a strong defence
of these civil rights whenever the Government tried to
curtail them. It was during this period and as a result
of nationalist political work that democratic ideas
began to take root among the Indian people in general
and the intelligentsia in particular. In fact, the struggle
for democratic freedoms became an integral part of the
nationalist struggle for freedom.
<br>
<br>
In 1897 the Bombay Government arrested B.G. Tilak
and several other leaders and newspaper editors, and
tried them, spreading disaffection against the
Government. They were sentenced to long terms of
imprisonment. At the same time two Poona leaders,
the Nathu brothers, were deported without trial. The
entire country protested against this attack on the
liberties of the people. Tilak, hitherto known largely in
Maharashtra, became overnight an all-India leader.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Methods of Political work</i></strong></div>

The political methods of the Moderates can be
summed up briefly as constitutional agitation within
the four walls of the law, and slow, orderly political
progress. Their political work had, therefore, a two
pronged direction.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Firstly, to build up a strong public opinion in
India to arouse the political consciousness and
national spirit of the people, and to educate and
unite on the political questions.</li>
        <li>Secondly, the early nationalists wanted to persuade
the British Government and British public opinion
to introduce reforms along directions laid down
by the nationalists.
Demand of the Moderates
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Expansion and power to legislative council.</li>
        <li>Greater opportunities for Indians in ICS exam.</li>
        <li>Reimposition of custom duties on cotton goods.</li>
        <li>Grant of self government to India within the British
Empire as in the colonies of Australia and Canada.</li>
        <li>Freedom of speech and expression.
Weakness</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The basic weakness of the Moderates lay in their
narrow social base. The leaders lacked political faith
in the masses as they declared that the time was not
ripe for throwing out a challenge to the foreign rulers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Government's Attitude</i></strong></div>

Regarding the attitude of the British Goverment
towards the Moderates, it became hostile soon after the
inception of INC. Dufferin, the then Governor General,
had tried to divert the national movement by suggesting
to Hume that the Congress should devote itself to social
causes rather than political affairs. But now Congress
leaders refused to do so. British officials now began to
criticise Congress and other nationalist leaders as
"disloyal Babus, seditious Brahmins and violent villains".
Dufferin remarked on Congress as "Microscopic minority".
Curzon said, "The Congress is tottering to its fall and one
of my great ambitions, while in India, is to assist it to a
peaceful demise". Besides the British officials relied upon
the policy of 'Divide and Rule' to weaken the nationalist
movement. They encourged Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and
Raja Shiv Prasad of Benaras and other pro-British Indians
to start an anti-Congress movement.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achivements</i></strong></div>

The politics of the Moderates was described as
"halting and half hearted" their methods were described
as those of mendicancy or beggary through prayers and
petition. They failed to get anything substantial from
the British through constitutional methods. But it is
only the single side of the fact. Moderates succeeded in
creating a wide political awakening and in arousing
among the Indians the feeling that they belong to one
nation. They exposed the true character of the British
imperialism in India. In spite of their many failures
they laid strong foundation for the national movement.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Extremists</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Causes of Growth of Extremism</i></strong></div>

A section of the Congress gradually lost faith in its
moderate programme in the early 20th century and
moved towards militant nationalism. It marked the
growth of a radical wing in the Congress. The political
events of the year 1892 to 1905 also disappointed the
nationalists and made them think of more radical
politics. The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was a
complete disappointment. On the other hand, even the
existing political rights of the people were attacked.
The Nathu brothers were deported in 1897 without
being tried'; even the charges against them were not
made public. In the same year, Lokmanya Tilak and
other newspaper editors were sentenced to long terms
of imprisonment for arousing the people against the
foreign government. The people found that, instead of
giving them wider political rights, the rulers were
taking away even their few existing rights.
In 1898, a law was passed making it an offence to
excite 'feelings of disaffection' towards the foreign
government. In 1899, the number of Indian members
in the Calcutta Corporation was reduced. In 1904, the
Indian Official Secrets Act was passed restricting the
freedom of the Press. The Indian Universities Act of
1904 was seen by the nationalists as an attempt to
bring Indian Universities under tighter official control
and to check the growth of higher education. The anticongress attitude of Lord Curzon convinced more and
more people that it was useless to expect any political
and economic advance as long as Britain ruled India.
Even the moderate leader Gokhale complained that
"the bureaucracy was growing frankly selfish and
openly hostile to national aspirations".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Agenda and Methods of Extremists</i></strong></div>

Four prominent Congress leaders Bal Gangadhar
Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal, Aurobindo Ghosh and Lala
Lajpat Rai were chief advocators of militant
nationalism. They rejected prayer and petition method
of moderates. The new leadership sought to create a
passionate love for liberty, accompanied by a spirit of
sacrifice and readyness to suffer for the cause of
country. They advocated boycott of foreign goods, use
of swadesi goods, national education and passive
resistance. They had deep faith in mass and they
planned to achieve swaraj through mass action.
The leaders of this wing gave up the soft approach
of appeals and prtitions. Instead, they made radical
(fundamental) demands and adopted strong ways of
political agitation. They had no faith in good intentions
of the British government. The extremist aimed at
achiveing 'swaraj' that meant complete independence
from British rule. They considered that the demand of
the moderate leaders for Swaraj was for colonial self
government. Tilak remarked, 'Swaraj is my birth right
and I shall have it'. Aurobindo Ghosh said "political
freedom is the life breath of a nation".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Radical Nationalists Politics</i></strong></div>

Larger numbers of educated Indians were employed
on extremely low salaries under alien rule. Many of
them even faced unemployment, so they were attracted
towards militant nationalism. They were fully aware
of contemporary international events. The rise of
modern Japan after 1868 showed that a backward
Asian country could develop itself without western
control. The defeat of the Italian army by the Ethiopians
in 1896 and of Russia by Japan in 1905 exploded the
myth of European superiority. Educated Indians were
watching carefully the revolutionary movements of
Russia, Egypt, Turkey, China and Ireland.
Thus there developed a school of militant nationalism
side by side with the moderate politics. This school was
represented by leaders like Rajanarain Bose and
Ashwini Kumar Dutt in Bengal and Vishnu Shastri
Chiplunkar in Maharashtra. The most outstanding
representative of this school was Bal Gangadhar Tilak.
Tilak helped in founding during 1880s 'the new
English School' which later became the Fergusson
College, and newspapers 'the Maratha' (in English)
and 'the Kesari' (in Marathi). From 1889, he edited the
Kesari and preached nationalism in its columns and
taught people to become courageous, self-reliant and
selfless fighters in the cause of India's independence.
In 1893, he started using the traditional religious
Ganpati festival to propagate nationalist ides through
songs and speeches. In 1895 he started the Shivaji
festival to simulate nationalism among young
Maharashtrians by holding up the example of Shivaji
for emulation.
<br>
<br>
He set a real example of boldness and sacrifice
Congress Sessions and Presidents
when the authorities arrested him in 1897 on the charge
of spreading hatred and disaffection against the
Government. He refused to apologize to the
Government and was sentecnced to 18 month's
rigorous imprisonment.
