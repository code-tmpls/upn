<h3>Indian Princely States</h3>


The Great Mughal Empire disintegrated in the
eighteenth century. Many Indian states as independent
or semi-independent principalities came into existence
in the later Mughal period. These small and weak
states made the Indian conquest of the East India
Company quite easy. Many states like Hyderabad,
Oudh and Rajput states were not annexed by the
Company but accepted its supremacy. Some states
which had for centuries resisted the Mughals and
later the Marathas were saved from extinction by
British intervention. Some states were created by the
British in the process of the overthrow of the Maratha
confederacy. The Indian states numbered no fewer
than 562 and covered a total area of 712,508 square
miles. A retrospective examination of the relations
between the British and the Indian states suggests the
following broad stages:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>East India Company's struggle for equality with
Indian states, 1740-65.</li>
        <li>Policy of Ring Fence, 1765-1813.</li>
        <li>The policy of Subordinate isolation, 1813-57.</li>
        <li>The policy of Subordinate Union, 1857-1935.</li>
        <li>The policy of Equal Federation, 1935-47.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>STRUGGLE FOR EQUALITY</i></strong></div>
       
The English East India Company was established
primarily as a commercial body. In order to enhance
its commercial interests in India, the Company
established political links and relationship with the
Mughals and by their orders and under their authority
opened its commercial and trading centres in various
parts of the Mughal Empire. But, the East India
Company had to face commercial competition from
other European Companies operating in India viz. the
Dutch, the Portuguese and the French. The unstable
political condition of the country during the 18th
century and the stiff competition from the other
European Companies forced the English Company to
think of a policy of political control and authority in
order to save and expand its economic programmes in
India. This resulted in the transformation of a purely
commercial trading company into a politically
ambitious one having the aim of establishing its
authority through territorial expansion.
<br>
<br>
It was Dupleix, the French Governor-General, who
started the political programme of a European trading
company in India in the 1740's. The English followed
the example of Dupleix and signalled their political
identity by the capture of Arcot in 1751. In 1757 the
English won the battle of Plassey and became the
political force behind the Nawabs of Bengal. The
Company became a ruling power after the Emperor
Shah Alam II granted it the Diwani of Bengal, Bihar
and Orissa in 1765. Till 1765 the Company stood in
relation to the Indian states in a position of
subordination and was striving for a status of equality
with them.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>RING FENCE</i></strong></div>
        
The Policy of Ring Fence (1765-1813) also known
as the Policy of Buffer state. Broadly speaking, it was
the policy of defence of their neighbours' frontiers for
safeguarding their own territories. The chief danger to
the Company's territories was from the Afghan
invaders and the Marathas. The defence of Oudh
constituted the defence of Bengal at that time.
With the arrival of Wellesley, the Company's
relations with the Indian states underwent a change.
Wellesley sought to reduce the Indian states to a
position of dependence on the Company even if not
declaredly so. The rulers of Hyderabad, Mysore, Oudh
and the other lesser states accepted the Subsidiary
Alliance system. The defeat of the Marathas in 1803
and Holkar in 1805 virtually established the supremacy
of British power. The Subsidiary system was the Trojanhorse tactics in Empire-building.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUBORDINATE ISOLATION</i></strong></div>
        
The Governor-Generalship of Lord Hastings opened
a new stage (1813-57) in the relations of the English
and the Indian Princely states. The Imperial idea grew
and the theory of paramountcy began to develop. The
treaties that he concluded with the Indian states were
not on the basis of reciprocity and mutual amity, but
imposed the obligation on the part of the Indian states
to act in subordinate cooperation with the British
Government and acknowledge its supremacy. Thus,
the Indian states surrendered all forms of external
sovereignty to the East India Company.
The states, however, retained full sovereignty in
internal administration. The decades following the
retirement of Lord Hastings saw the rapid increase of
the influence of the Company in the internal
administration of the states. The British Residents were
usually the organs of communication between the
Government of India and the rulers of Indian states.
Gradually their influence and power increased with
the assertion of the Company's paramountcy and
adoption of the policy of 'subordinate cooperation'
under Lord Hastings down to 1857. "The Resident
ministers of the Company at Indian courts were slowly
but effectively transformed from diplomatic agents
representing a foreign power into executive and
controlling officers of a superior Government". Raja
Chandu Lal during his administration in Hyderabad
took his orders from the Resident, Colonel Low. Colonel
Walker acted as an administrator-Resident when he
helped the Gaekwar to collect revenue from the feudal
chiefs. The same situation was in Mysore, Travancore
and other states.
<br>
<br>
The Charter Act of 1833 metamorphosed the
character of the Company. The Company was asked to
wind up its commercial business. It assumed political
functions in fact and name. A radical change followed
in the policy towards the Indian states. The policy of
annexation of states whenever and wherever possible
was laid down by the Court of Directors in 1834. The
policy was reiterated with emphasis in 1841 when the
Court of Directors issued a directive to the GovernorGeneral to persevere in the one clear and direct course
of abandoning no just and honourable accession of
territory or revenue''.
The Governor-Generals of this period were frankly
annexationists. Annexations were made to acquire new
territories and new source of revenue in the plea of
failure of natural heirs or misgovernment. The Company
as the supreme power had the right to withhold
sanctions for `adoption' of heirs and the states in such
cases `lapsed back' to the supreme power. It was Lord
Dalhousie's great political programme. Prior to him,
Lord William Bentinck annexed Mysore (1831), Cachar
(1832), Coorg (1834) and Jaintia (1835). Auckland
annexed Karnul, Mandavi (1839), Kolaba and Jalaun
(1840). Dalhousie annexed about a half dozen Indian
states including big states.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes a Governor-General followed earlier
precedents, at other times created new precedents. Where
a good number of Indian states were annexed, some
states like Khairpur in 1832, Bahawalpur in 1833,
Kashmir in 1846 were assured of the Company's policy
of non-intervention into the internal affairs of their states.
Thus, these policies together constituted the Company
are paramountcy-undefined, undefinable, but always
tending to expand under the strong pressure of political
circumstances.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUBORDINATE UNION</i></strong></div>
        
The years following the proclamation of 1858
marked a vital transformation in the relations between
the Indian states and Government of India. The policy
of Subordinate Union (1857-1935) was adopted in this
phase. Now the Empire of India passed over to the
crown. The Queen's Proclamation announced the
abandonment of the policy of annexation. The 'Doctrine
of Lapse' was abandoned. The change in the policy
was due to the loyal attitude of the ruling Princes
during the Revolt of 1857-58 which had amply
demonstrated that the Princes could be used as
breakwaters to future possible storms in India.
Lord Canning gave practical shape to the new trend
by granting 140 Sanads or `instruments or grants of
adoption' to Hindu and Muslim Princes. Lord
Lansdowne issued 17 more Sanads. The new policy
was to punish the ruler for misgovernment and if
necessary to depose him but not to annex the state.
This change in policy was welcomed by the Princes.
This immunity from the policy of annexation was
obtained, however, at great cost and lowering of the
status of the Indian Princes. Under the East India
Company the sanction of the Governor-General was
necessary only in case of failure of `natural heirs'.
After 1858, the fiction of the authority of the Mughal
Emperor came to an end and the Crown stood forth as
the unquestioned ruler and paramount power in India.
As such, all successions had to regularly seek the
sanction of the Crown. Normally every ruler was
formally installed on the Gaddi by the British Agent.
Further, the fiction of the Indian Princes standing
on a status of equality with the Crown as sovereign
independent states finally came to an end. Canning
referred to the rulers of Indian states as `feudatories
and Vassals' and to the Crown as `the unquestioned
ruler and paramount power in India'. Paramountcy
was not only a historical fact but a legal principle
capable of interpretation and expansion. The Royal
Titles Act of 1876 put the final seal on the new
relationship by proclaiming the Queen as Kaiser-iHind, Queen Emperor of India. A Government
notification dated 21st August, 1891 declared: ``The
Paramount supremacy of the former (the Crown)
presupposes and implies the subordination of the latter
(Indian Princes)''.
<br>
<br>
The Government of India exercised complete and
undisputed control over the external and international
affairs of the Indian States. The Government of India
could declare war, neutrality or peace for the Indian
states. The period also saw the growth of 'political
practice' and 'usage' which further circumscribed the
rights of Indian Princes. Under the impress of
changing circumstances, the Crown exercised powers
which exceeded the most liberal interpretation of
treaties. Lord Curzon stretched the interpretation of
old treaties to mean that the Indian Princes in their
capacity as servants of the people should work side by
side with the Governor-General in the scheme of Indian
Government. He adopted the policy of patronage and
'intrusive surveillance". The new trend seemed to
reduce all the Indian states to conform to a single type,
whether they were treaty states or enjoying varying
degrees of authority.
<br>
<br>
From 1905 onwards the Government of India
followed a policy of cordial co-operation towards the
Indian states. The growth of political unrest in British
India put the Government of India on the defensive
and the Government thought it expedient and prudent
to utilize the support of Indian Princes to counter
progressive and revolutionary developments. The
Government of India and the Indian Princes formed
"Common front to preserve their positions and
privileges''. Thus, the policy of subordinate isolation
gave place to the policy of subordinate union. The
authors of Montague-Chelmsford Reforms favoured
the formation of a Council of Princes and made definite
suggestions in the matter. These recommendations
formed the nucleus for the formation of the Chamber
of Princes, formally inaugurated in February 1921. For
the purposes of representation in the Chamber of
Princes, the Indian states were divided into three
categories:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>109 states which enjoyed full legislative and
jurisdictional powers were represented directly.</li>
        <li>127 states which enjoyed limited legislative and
jurisdi-ctional powers were represented by 12
members chosen from among themselves.</li>
        <li>Remaining 326 states which could be better
classified as jagirs or estates or feudal holdings.</li>

    </ul>
</ol>

The Chamber of Princes was merely an advisory
and consultative body. It had no concern with the
internal affairs of individual states nor could it discuss
matters concerning the existing rights of states or their
freedom of action. The Indian Princes thus became the
favourite children of British Imperialism and in fact
were ''collectively recognized as an independent
constituent of the Empire''. On the request of the Princes
a codification committee was appointed as early as
September 1919 to codify `political practice' and define
limits of the concept of Paramountcy. In 1927 the
Government appointed the Indian states committee,
popularly known as the Butler committee under the
chairmanship of Sir Harcourt Butler to investigate the
relationship between the paramount power and the
Indian states. The Indian Princes engaged a
distinguished lawyer, Sir Leslie Scott, to present their
view point before the committee. Scott pleaded that
residuary powers rested with the Indian states.
The Butler committee made the following
recommendations:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On the question of paramountcy and development
of political practice, the committee reported:
paramountcy must remain paramount, it must
fulfill its obligations, by defining and adopting
itself according to the shifting necessities, of the
time and the progressive development of states''
and further that ``usage of lights up the dark
corners of treaties''.</li>
        <li>The states were bound by treaties with the Crown
and the states should not be handed over without
the ruler's prior consent to an Indian Government
in British India responsible to an Indian legislature.</li>
        <li>The Viceroy, not the Governor-General-in-Council,
was to be the crown agent in dealing with the
states.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Indian Princes were surprised at the concept
of Paramountcy being left undefined. Nevertheless the
hydra-headed creature was fed on usage and Crown
prerogative and "the implied consent' of the Princes.
        </li>
        <li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>EQUAL FEDERATION</i></strong></div>
        
This was the phase of the Policy of Equal Federation
(1935-47). The Indian Princes were invited at the Round
Table conference during 1930-32. In the Federal structure
proposed for the whole of India by the Government of
India Act 1935, the Indian states were to be allotted 125
out of 375 seats in the Federal Assembly and 104 out
of 200 seats in the Council of States.
<br>
<br>
The Federation of India was to come into existence
only when the rulers of states representing not less
than one-half of the total population of the states and
entitled to not less than half of the seats (i.e. 52) allotted
to the states in the upper house of the federal legislature
agreed to join the Federation. The Federation never
came into existence for the requisite number of states
did not agree to join it. The Congress successes in the
elections of 1937 had repercussions on the states where
agitation started for civil liberties and responsible
Government.
<br>
<br>
In December 3, 1938 Mahatma Gandhi declared that
the awakening in the states was due to the 'time spirit'
and that there could be no half way house between
total extinction of the states and full responsible
Government. The outbreak of the Second World War in
1919 finally shelved the scheme of Federation.
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Movement In Various States</i></strong></div>

Hyderabad: In the biggest princely state of all,
Hyderabad, a small Muslim elite held 90% of
government jobs and urdu was maintained as the sole
official language and medium of instruction where
more than half of the population was Telugu speaking,
25% Marathi and 11% Kannada speaking. There was
a total absence of elementary civil and political rights
and extremely crude forms of feudal exploitation, like
Vetti, or forced Labour and compulsory payments in
kind. Popular awakening initially took the form of
middle class language based associations like Andra
Mahasabha. The Arya Samaj and the Hindu
Mahasabha campaigned against the tyranny of the
Nizam and the 'Ittahad ul-Mussalman'. The Aga leader
Pandit Narendraji started a purely Hindu Satyagraha
in Hyderabad city and the Marathwada region in
October 1938, with the demand for more jobs for
Hindus. At about the same time, a state Congress had
been founded on a secular basis by Swami Rama
Nanda Tirtha and Govindas Shroff from Marathwada,
Ravi Narayan Reddi and a few Muslims like Sirajul
Hasan Tirmizi from Hyderabad city. A powerful
'Vande Mataram' movement developed among
Osmania students, who left the University when the
Nizam banned the singing of that patriotic hymn. The
Congress movement, however, was called off at
Gandhi's insistence in December 1938. Soon under
Ravi Narayan Reddi, a Nizam State committee of the
C. P. J. was established secretly in 1939. Using the
broad front of the Andhra Mahasabha, the communists
helped with arms of fight against the Nizam's
suppression and built the base of greatest peasant
guerrilla war in Telengana.
<br>
<br>
Travancore, Cochin: In Travancore and Cochin, as
in the adjoining Malayalee districts of Malabar, the
National movement was built up very largely under
the Leftist leadership and guidance. In the mid and
late 1930's activists like Krishna Pillai, E. M. S.
Namboodripad, and A. K. Gopalan founded the
Congress Socialist party, converted the Congress for
the first time into a real mass organisation, and
simultaneously moved towards Communism. In
August 1938, the Travancore state Congress started a
powerful agitation against the autocracy of Diwan C.
P. Ramaswami Iyer. Despite brutal repression, students
joined the satyagraha in large numbers and jathas
marched into Travancore from many parts of Kerala.
Particularly impressive was the role of working class.
Alleppey coir workers led by Krishna Pillai went on
strike on October 1938, demanding not only wageincrease and union recognition 
but release of political prisoners and responsible Government based on
universal franchise. The Dewan was forced to call off
repressive measures against the Congress Satyagraha
in order to isolate Alleppey workers.
Mysore: There was a rapid growth of people's
movements in Mysore. The Gandhian controls
remained fairly firm in Mysore, where K. T. Bhashyam's
state Congress, initially based on Brahman urban
professional groups, extended its support through
merger in October 1937 with the People's Federation of
Non-Brahman Rural Landholders led by K. C. Reddy
and H. C. Desappa. A first round of agitation from
October 1937 for legalization of the Congress and
responsible government culminated on 11th April 1938
in a blood-bath at Viduraswatha village in Kolan
district where 30 were killed by firing on a crowd of
10,000.
<br>
<br>
In the following month Sardar Patel concluded a
truce with Dewan Mirza Ismail which legalized the
Congress, but failure to implement promises of
significant constitutional reforms led to another round
of civil disobedience from September 1939. Effective
Congress leadership of controlled mass movements
built up strength for the party in the region and for the
development of Mysore and final merger in the Indian
union.
<br>
<br>
Jaipur: Like other states in Rajasthan, Jaipur also
witnessed people's movement for civil liberties,
responsible Government and social and other reforms.
It was more aggressive in 1939. Gandhiji decided to
try out his specific techniques of controlled mass
struggle for the first time in a native state. He allowed
his close adjutant, the business magnate Jamnalal
Bajaj, to lead a satyagraha in Jaipur. The Government
imposed a ban on Bajaj's entry in Jaipur. On violating
the ban, Jamnalal Bajaj was arrested. This resulted in
wide scale satyagraha. Ultimately the government had
to release Jamnalal Bajaj.
Rajkot: Gandhiji and Vallabhbhai Patel, began a
personal intervention in the movement in Rajkot which
had been started by the local Praja Parishad under U.
N. Dhebar. Virawala, the very unpopular Diwan of
Rajkot, had imposed numerous monopolies disliked
by local traders and stopped summoning an advisory
elected council set up earlier, while nearly half the
revenues of the state were swallowed up by the privy
purse of its ruler. The choice of Rajkot by Gandhiji is
very significant; a tiny state surrounded by the firm
Gandhian base of Gujarat, almost half its population
lived in the Capital and so there was little danger of
agrarian radicalism swamping strictly non-violent
satyagraha. Kasturba Gandhi and Manibehn Patel
courted arrest in February 1939, and Gandhiji himself
went to Rajkot and started a fast on 3rd March-just on
the eve of the Tripuri Congress. The Rajkot intervention,
however, proved to be one of Gandhiji's failures, for
the British political department instigated Virawala to
withdraw the concessions he had offered at one stage,
as well as to skillfully encourage Muslim and
untouchable demands for more seats in the Proposed
Reforms Committee. Gandhiji, bowed himself out of
the Rajkot affair in May 1939.
<br>
<br>
Orissa: In the much more backward interior state
of Orissa, issues like forced labour, taxes on forest
produce, extortion of 'gifts' on festive occasions or
tenancy rights inevitably were as much if not more
important than demand for political reform. The
Congress socialist party leader Naba Krushna
Chaudhari led a satyagraha in Dhenkanal in December
1938, powerful movements developed in Nilgiri,
Nayagarh, Talcher and Ranpur, and there were
numerous violent incidents. On 5th January 1939, the
British political agent in Ranpur, Major Barzelgette
was stoned to death. Gandhiji did his best to get the
Orissan movements called off in return for some token
political reforms in Dhenkanal and Talcher.
Kashmir: In Kashmir the 'National Conference'
started the movement demanding various reforms. It
was led by Sheik Abdullah. The ruler of Kashmir used
various measures to suppress the movement. Sheikh
Abdullah along with other leaders was arrested.
National Congress provided support to the movement
of Sheikh Abdullah but this movement failed to yield
any fruitful results.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Integration & Merger
of States</i></strong></div>

During the Second World War, India witnessed
hectic political activity. The British Government made
various efforts to break the deadlock-Cripp's proposal
(1942), Wavell's plan (1945), the Cabinet mission plan
(1946) and finally Atlee's announcement (20th February
1947). The future of the Indian states figured in all
constitutional discussions. Cripps mission declared
that the British Government did not contemplate
transferring the paramountcy of the Crown to any
other party in India. The Princes worked on various
schemes to form a Union of their own with full
sovereign status-a third force in the Indian political
setup. The Cabinet Mission Plan proposed Federation
of India which would include the Indian States. The
Federation was to make law on defence and
communication and foreign affairs while the residuary
powers would be vested in the Indian states. The rulers
of the states accepted the proposals of the Cabinet
mission plan. But after the declaration of partition
proposal, Travancore and Hyderabad proposed for an
independent state by rejecting the cabinet mission plan.
Atlee's announcement of 20 February 1947 and
Mountbatten's plan of 3rd June 1947, however,
emphasized that with the lapse of paramountcy, Indian
states would be free to join any Dominion they liked,
India or Pakistan. Lord Mountbatten refused to
recognize any state or combination of states as separate
Dominions.
<br>
<br>
In the National Provisional Government, Sardar
Patel headed the states ministry and appealed to the
sense of patriotism of Indian princes and urged them
to join the Indian Union on the basis of the surrender
of three subjects of Defence, Foreign Affairs and
Communications. He was assisted by V.P. Menon in
this work of unification by 15th August 1947 as many
as 136 Jurisdictional states acceded to the India Union.
Kashmir signed the Instrument of Accession on 26th
October 1947, Junagadh and Hyderabad in 1948. Many
small states which were too small for a modern system
of administration were merged with the adjoining
provinces i.e. 39 states of Orissa and Chattisgarh
became part of either Orissa or Central provinces;
Gujarat states were merged with the Bombay province.
A second form of the integration of states was the
formation of units into centrally adminsitered areas.
In this category came the states of Himachal Pradesh,
Vindhya Pradesh, Tripura, Manipur, Bhopal, Bilaspur
and Kutch.
<br>
<br>
A third form of the integration of states was the
formation of state unions. Thus came into existence
the United States of Kathiawad, United States of
Matsya, the Union of Vindhya Pradesh, Madhya Bharat,
the Patiala and East Punjab state Union (PEPSU),
Rajasthan and United States of Cochin-Travancore.
Later, the State Reorganisation Acts 1956 was passed
by the Union Parliament that provided for the setting
up of 14 states and 6 Union territories. Today Indian
union has 28 states and 7 Union territories.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Andhra Pradesh was created On 1 November 1956

        <li>The Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay state,

        <li>Kerala was created by the State Reorganization
Act, 1956. It comprised of Travancore and Cochin.</li>
        <li>Karnataka was created on 1 November 1956.

renamed Karnataka in 1973.</li>
        <li>Punjab was divided along linguistic lines in 1966;
the Hindi-speaking southern half of Punjab became
a separate state-'Haryana' and Pahari speaking
hilly areas in north east formed "Himachal
Pradesh". The rest remained as Punjab.

        <li>Sikkim was first given the Status of Associate State
