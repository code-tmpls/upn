<h3>Partition And Integration Of Princely States</h3>

The era after India’s independence from colonial
rule starts with its partition into two halves – India
and Pakistan. Lord Mountbatten became the first
Governor General of free India and M.A. Jinnah
that of Pakistan. The transition was violent, with
blood curling massacres all over the country, ample
proof to the historic acrimony that the Indians
shared within themselves.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PARTITION: THE TRAGEDY</i></strong></div>

India and Pakistan won independence in
August 1947, following a nationalist struggle lasting
nearly three decades. It set a vital precedent for
the negotiated winding up of European empires
elsewhere. Unfortunately, it was accompanied by
the largest mass migration in human history of some
10 million. As many as one million civilians died in
the accompanying riots and local-level fighting,
particularly in the western region of Punjab which
was cut in two by the border. One explanation for
the chaos in which the two nations came into being,
is Britain's hurried withdrawal with the realisation
it could ill-afford its over-extended empire.
Pakistan celebrated its independence on 14
August and India on 15 August, 1947, the border
between the two new states was not announced
until 17 August. It was drawn up by a British
lawyer, Cyril Radcliffe, who had little knowledge
of Indian conditions and with the use of out-ofdate maps and census materials. Communities,
families and farms were cut in two, but by delaying
the announcement the British managed to avoid
responsibility for the worst fighting and the mass
migration that had followed. The total population
of the undivided Punjab Province was 33 million.
It included territories directly administered by the
British (pop. 28 million) and several princely states.
The Punjab was a Muslim majority province while
Hindus and Sikhs together made up a very large
minority of 44-47 per cent. The principle on which
India and the Punjab were divided was that
Muslim-majority areas were separated from the rest
of India and given to Pakistan. After partition, 90%
of the sub-continent's industry, and taxable income
base remained in India, including the largest cities
of Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta. The economy of
Pakistan was chiefly agricultural, and controlled
by feudal elites. The great advantage enjoyed by
the Indian National Congress was that it had
worked hard for 40 years to reconcile differences
and achieve some cohesion among its leaders. The
heartland of support for the Muslim League,
however, lay in central north India (Uttar Pradesh)
which was not included within Pakistan.
 The Partition of India ranks, beyond doubt, as
one of the 10 greatest tragedies in human history.
For the Punjab alone, the loss of life is estimated
somewhere between 500,000-800,000 and 10
million people were forced to flee for their lives.
More importantly, after World War II the first case
of ethnic cleansing took place in the Punjab.
Therefore, it bore the brunt of the partition violence.
Thus at the end of 1947 all traces of a Muslim
presence in the Indian East Punjab were wiped
out, except for some Muslims remaining in the tiny
princely state of Malerkotla. In the Pakistani West
Punjab, Hindus and Sikhs became conspicuous by
their absence.
<br>
<br>
Fear of an uncertain future, lack of
communication between the leaders of the estranged
communities, the waning authority of the British
and the consequent unreliability of the state
institutions and functionaries created the social and
political milieu in which suspicion and fear
proliferated, generating angst among the common
people. In such situations reaction and overreaction
led to intended and unintended consequences which
aggravated and finally resulted in the biggest
human tragedy in the history of the Indian subcontinent. Partition was more than a geographical
mutilation of the sub-continent; it was one of those
dehumanising horror stories that have sustained
the 20th century's narratives on revolutions and
liberation, be it the Fuhrer's Final Solution or the
Pol Pot's ethnic cleansing, Mao's Cultural Revolution
or Stalin's Great Terror. It is a stain on our freedom,
the scar on our memory as a nation.
<br>
<br>
In January 1948, the government of India,
following a fast by Gandhiji, paid Pakistan Rs. 550
million as part of the assets of Partition, even when
it feared that the money might be used to finance
military action in Kashmir. The governments of the
two countries differed on issues raised by evacuee
property, left behind by those who migrated from
the two countries, but every effort was made to
resolve them through renegotiations. Since August
of 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three major
wars and one minor war over territorial disputes.
The boundary line in Jammu and Kashmir is
particularly troubled. The partition of India is a
signal event in world history, not merely in the
history of the Indian sub-continent.
As a result of Partition, 8 million refugees had
come into the country from what was now
Pakistan. These people had to be found homes and
jobs. Then there was the problem of the princely
states, almost 500 of them, each ruled by a
maharaja or a nawab, each of whom had to
be persuaded to join the new nation. The problems
of the refugees and of the princely states had to be
addressed immediately. In the longer term, the new
nation had to adopt a political system that would
best serve the hopes and expectations of its
population.
<br>
<br>
India’s population in 1947 was large, almost
345 million. It was also divided. There were
divisions between high castes and low castes,
between the majority Hindu community and
Indians who practiced other faiths. The citizens of
this vast land spoke many different languages, wore
many different kinds of dress, ate different kinds
of food and practiced different professions. How
could they be made to live together in one nationstate?
The government had to stretch itself to the
maximum to give relief to and resettle and
rehabilitate the nearly six million refugees from
Pakistan who had lost their all there and whose
world had been turned upside down. The task took
some time but it was accomplished. By 1951, the
problem of the rehabilitation of the refugees from
West Pakistan was fully tackled. The task of
rehabilitating and resettling refugees from East
Bengal was made more difficult by the fact that
the exodus of Hindus from East Bengal continued
for years. While nearly all the Hindus and Sikhs
from West Pakistan had migrated in one go in 1947,
a large number of Hindus in East Bengal had stayed
on there in the initial years of 1947 and 1948.
However, as violence against Hindus broke out
periodically in East Bengal, there was a steady
stream of refugees from there year after year until
1971. Providing them with work and shelter and
psychological assurance, therefore became a
continuous and hence a difficult task. Unlike in
Bengal, most of the refugees from West Punjab
could occupy the large lands and property left by
the Muslim migrants to Pakistan from Punjab, U.P.
and Rajasthan and could therefore be resettled on
land.
<br>
<br>
This was not the case in West Bengal. In
addition, because of linguistic affinity, it was easier
for Punjabi and Sindhi refugees to settle in today’s
Himachal Pradesh and Haryana and western U.P.,
Rajasthan and Delhi. The resettlement of the
refugees from East Bengal could take place only in
Bengal and to a lesser extent in Assam and Tripura.
As a result, a very large number of people who
had been engaged in agricultural occupations before
their displacement were forced to seek survival in
semi-urban and urban contexts as the underclass.
To the problem of unity was added the problem
of development. At Independence, the vast majority
of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and
peasants depended on the monsoon for their
survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural
economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters,
weavers and other service groups would not get
paid for their services either. In the cities, factory
workers lived in crowded slums with little access
to education or healthcare. Clearly, the new nation
had to lift its masses out of poverty by increasing
the productivity of agriculture and by promoting
new, job-creating industries. Unity and
development had to go hand in hand. If the
divisions between different sections of India
were not healed, they could result in violent and
costly conflicts – high castes fighting with low castes,
Hindus with Muslims and so on. At the same time,
if the fruits of economic development did not reach
the broad masses of the population, it could create
fresh divisions – for example, between the rich and
the poor, between cities and the countryside,
between regions of India that were prosperous and
regions that lagged behind.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ASSASSINATION OF MAHATMA GANDHI</i></strong></div>

Rejoicing in August 1947, the man who had
been in the forefront of the freedom struggle since
1919, the man who had given the message of nonviolence and love and courage to the Indian people,
the man who had represented the best in Indian
culture and politics, was touring the hate-torn lands
of Bengal and Bihar, trying to douse the communal
fire and bring comfort to people who were paying
through senseless slaughter the price of freedom.
In reply to a message of birthday congratulations
in 1947, Gandhiji said that he no longer wished to
live long and that he would invoke the aid of the
all-embracing Power to take me away from this
“vale of tears” rather than make me a helpless
witness of the butchery by man become savage,
whether he dares to call himself a Muslim or a
Hindu or what not.
<br>
<br>
The celebrations of independence had hardly
died down when on 30th January, 1948, a radical
minded Hindu, Nathuram Godse, assassinated
Gandhiji at Birla house, just before his evening
prayers. The whole nation was shocked and
stricken with grief and communal violence retreated
from the minds of men and women. Expressing
the nation’s sorrow, Nehru spoke over the All India
Radio:
<br>
“Friends and comrades, the light has gone out
of our lives and there is darkness everywhere . . .
The light has gone out, I said, and yet I was wrong.
For the light that shone in this country was no
ordinary light . . . that light represented something
more than the immediate present; it represented
the living, the eternal truths, reminding us of the
right path, drawing us from error, taking this
ancient country to freedom.”

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTEGRATION OF PRINCELY STATES</i></strong></div>

With great skill and diplomacy and using both
persuasions and pressure, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel
succeeded in integrating the hundreds of princely
states with the India Union. Some states have joined
the Contituent Assembly in April 1947. But the
majority of princess had stayed away and a few,
such as those of Travancore, Bhopal and
Hyderabad, publicly announced their desire to
claim an independent status. On 27 June, 1947,
Sardar Patel assumed charge of the newly created
States, Department with V.P. Menon as its
Secretary. Patel’s first step was to appeal to the
princes whose territories fell inside India to accede
to the Indian Union in three subjects: foreign
relation, defense and communications. Fearful of
the rising people’s movements in states, and of
Patel’s reputation for firmness all but three of them
–Junagadh, Jammu and Kashmir and Hyderabad
—acceded to India by 15 August, 1947.
<br>
<br>
Junagadh was a small state on the coast of
Saurashtra surrounded by Indian territory and
therefore without any geographical continuity with
Pakistani. Yet, its Nawab announced accession of
his state to Pakistan on 15 August, 1947 even
thought the people of the state, overwhelmingly
Hindu, desired to join India. Pakistan accepted
Junagadh’s accession. On the other hand, the people
of the state were against the ruler’s decision. They
organized a popular movement, forced the Nawab
to flee and established a provisional government.
Indian troops marched into the state. A plebiscite
was held in the state in February 1948 which went
overwhelmingly in favour of joining India.
<br>
<br>
The state of Kashmir was bordered on both
India and Pakistan. Its ruler Hari Singh was a
Hindu, while nearly 75 per cent of the population
was Muslim. Hari Singh did not accede either to
India or Pakistan. He hoped to stay out of both
and to continue as an independent ruler. On 22
October, with the onset of winter, several Pathan
tribesman, led unofficially by Pakistani army
officers, invaded Kashmir and rapidly pushed
towards Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. In panic,
on 24 October, the Maharaja appealed to India for
military assistance. Within days, acting under
pressure, the Maharaja acceded to India and signed
the instrument of accession with India. After
accession India decided to send troops to Srinagar.
In order to avoid a full-scale war between India
and Pakistan, the Government of India agreed, on
30 December, 1947, on Mountbatten’s suggestion,
to refer the Kashmir problem to the United Nations
Security Council, asking for vacation of aggression
by Pakistan. Nehru was to regret this decision later
as the Kashmir issue became a victim of cold war
politics. Security Council, guided by Britain and
the United States, tended to side with Pakistan
instead of declaring Pakistan an aggressor state.
The Nizam of Hyderabad was the third Indian
ruler who did not accede to India before 15 August.
Instead, he claimed an independent status and,
encouraged by Pakistan, began to expand his armed
forces. In November 1947, the Government of India
signed a standstill agreement with the Nizam,
hoping that while the negotiations proceeded, the
latter would introduce representative government
in the state. But the Nizam hoped to prolong
negotiations and in the meanwhile build up his
military strength and force India to accept his
sovereignty. Meanwhile, there was rapid growth
of the militant Muslim communal organization,
Ittlihad ul Muslimin and its paramilitary wing, the
Razakars with active official help by Nizam. As a
result of attacks by the Razakars and repression by
the state authorities, thousands of people fled the
state and took shelter in temporary camps in Indian
territory. The state Congress-led movement now
took to arms. By then a powerful communist-led
peasant struggle had developed in the Talangana
region of the state from the latter half of 1946. On
13 September, 1948, the Indian army moved into
Hyderabad. The Nizam surrendered after three
days and acceded to the Indian Union in November.
The government of India retained Nizam as formal
ruler of the state or its Rajpramukh, was given a
privy purse, and permitted to keep most of his
wealth.
<br>
<br>
In return for their surrender of all power and
authority, the rulers of major states were given
privy purses in perpetuity, free of all taxes. The
privy purse amounted to Rs. 4.66 crore in 1949
and were later guaranteed by the constitution. The
ruler were allowed succession to the gaddi and
retained certain privileges such as keeping their
titles, flying their personal flags and gun salutes on
ceremonial occasion. However, later Indira Gandhi
abolished most of the above mentioned concessions.
After waiting patiently for international opinion
to put pressure on Portugal, Nehru ordered Indian
troops to march into Goa on the night of 17
December, 1961. The governor-General of Goa
immediately surrendered without a fight and the
territorial and political integration of India was
completed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FIRST INDO-PAKISTAN WAR (1947)</i></strong></div>

In the 18th century, Kashmir was ruled by
the Pashtun Durrani Empire. In 1819, Kashmir was
conquered by the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. Following
the First Anglo-Sikh War in 1845 and 1846,
Kashmir was first ceded by the Treaty of Lahore to
the East India Company, and shortly after sold by
the Treaty of Amritsar to Gulab Singh, Raja of
Jammu, who thereafter was given the title Maharaja
of Jammu and Kashmir. From then until the
Partition of India in 1947, Kashmir was ruled by
the Hindu Maharajas of the princely state
of Kashmir and Jammu, although the majority of
the population were Muslim, except in the
Jammu and Ladakh region.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PARTITION AND DISPUTE</i></strong></div>

In 1947, British rule in India ended with the
creation of a new state: the Dominion of
Pakistan and a successor state to British India
the Union of India, while British suzerainty over
the 562 Indian princely states ended. According
to the Indian Independence Act, 1947, "the
suzerainty of His Majesty over the Indian States
lapses, and with it, all treaties and agreements in
force at the date of the passing of this Act between
His Majesty and the rulers of Indian States", so the
states were left to choose whether to join India or
Pakistan or to remain independent. Jammu and
Kashmir, the largest of the princely states, had a
predominantly Muslim population, while having a
Hindu ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh. On partition
Pakistan expected Kashmir to be annexed to it.
In October 1947, Muslim revolutionaries in
western Kashmir and Pakistani tribals from
Dir entered Kashmir, intending to eliminate
Dogra rule. Unable to withstand the invasion, the
Maharaja signed the Instrument of Accession on 25
October, 1947 that was accepted by the government
of India on 27 October, 1947.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDO-PAKISTANI WAR (1947)</i></strong></div>

After rumours that the Maharaja supported the
annexation of Kashmir by India, militant Muslim
revolutionaries from western Kashmir and Pakistani
tribesmen made rapid advances into the
Baramulla sector. Maharaja Hari Singh of Kashmir
asked the government of India to intervene.
However, India and Pakistan had signed an
agreement of non-intervention. Although tribal
fighters from Pakistan had entered Jammu and
Kashmir, there was no iron-clad legal evidence to
unequivocally prove that Pakistan was officially
involved. It would have been illegal for India to
unilaterally intervene in an open, official capacity
unless Jammu and Kashmir officially joined the
Union of India, at which point it would be possible
to send in its forces and occupy the remaining
parts.
<br>
<br>
The Maharaja desperately needed military
assistance when the Pakistani tribals reached the
outskirts of Srinagar. Before their arrival into
Srinagar, India argued that the Maharaja must
complete negotiations for ceding Jammu and
Kashmir to India in exchange for receiving military
aid. The agreement which ceded Jammu and
Kashmir to India was signed by the Maharaja
and Lord Mountbatten. In Jammu and Kashmir,
National Conference volunteers worked with
the Indian Army to drive out the Pakistanis.
The resulting war over Kashmir, the First
Kashmir War, lasted until 1948, when India moved
the issue to the UN Security Council. Sheikh
Abdullah was not in favour of India seeking UN
intervention because he was sure that the Indian
Army could free the entire State of invaders. The
UN had previously passed resolutions for setting
up monitoring of the conflict in Kashmir. Following
the set-up of the United Nations Commission for
India and Pakistan (UNCIP), the UN Security
Council passed Resolution 47 on 21 April, 1948.
The resolution imposed an immediate cease-fire and
called on the Government of Pakistan 'to secure
the withdrawal from the state of Jammu and
Kashmir of tribesmen and Pakistani nationals not
normally resident therein who have entered the
state for the purpose of fighting.' It also asked
Government of India to reduce its forces to the
minimum strength, after which the circumstances
for holding a plebiscite should be put into effect
'on the question of Accession of the state to India
or Pakistan.' However, both India and Pakistan
failed to arrive at a Truce agreement due to
differences in interpretation of the procedure for
and extent of demilitarization one of them being
whether the Azad Kashmiri army is to be disbanded
during the truce stage or the Plebiscite stage.
In November 1948, The Indian and Pakistani
governments agreed to hold the plebiscite, but
Pakistan did not withdraw its troops from Kashmir,
thus violating the conditions for holding the
plebiscite. In addition, the Indian Government
distanced itself from its commitment to hold a
plebiscite. India proposed that Pakistan withdraw
all its troops first, calling it a precondition for a
plebiscite. Pakistan rejected on the grounds that
the Kashmiris may not vote freely given the presence
of Indian army and Sheikh Abdullah's friendship
with the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.
<br>
<br>
However, Pakistan proposed simultaneous
withdrawal of all troops followed by a plebiscite
under international auspices, which India
rejected. Hence Pakistan didn't withdraw its forces
unilaterally. Over the next several years, the UN
Security Council passed four new resolutions,
revising the terms of Resolution 47 to include a
synchronous withdrawal of both Indian and
Pakistani troops from the region, per the
recommendations of General Andrew McNaughton.
To this end, UN arbitrators put forward 11
different proposals for the demilitarization of the
region. All of these were accepted by Pakistan, but
rejected by the Indian government. The resolutions
were passed by United Nations Security Council
under Chapter VI of the United Nations
Charter. Resolutions passed under Chapter VI of
the UN charter are considered non-binding and
have no mandatory enforceability, as opposed to
the resolutions passed under Chapter VII.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MYTH OF NEHRU AND PATEL RIVALRY</i></strong></div>

Nehru and Vallabhbhai Patel were not
opponents and adversaries. This myth is promoted
by advocates of a ‘strong’ India, by those who
believe that Nehru was soft on Pakistan, soft on
China, and soft on the minorities. It is usually
accompanied by a subsidiary myth, namely, that
Patel would have made a ‘better’ Prime Minister
than Nehru. In truth, Nehru and Patel worked
superbly as a team—who, in the first, formative
years of independence, effectively united and
strengthened India. Of course, they differed by
temperament and ideology. But these differences
were subsumed and transcended by commitment
to a common ideal: namely, a free, united, secular
and democratic India. There were some things
Nehru could do better than Patel—communing
with the masses, relating to the world, assuring
vulnerable groups (such as Muslims, tribals, and
Dalits) that they enjoyed equal rights with other
Indians. There were some things Patel could do
better than Nehru—dealing with the princes,
nurturing the Congress party, carrying along
dissidents in the Constituent Assembly. Each knew
the other’s gifts, each took care not to tresspass on
the other person’s turf. That is how, together, they
built India anew out of the ruins of Partition. Along
with the Kashmir issue, an important sources of
consent tension between the two countries was the
strong sense of insecurity among Hindus in East
Bengal, fuelled primarily by the communal
character of Pakistan’s political system. This led to
the steady migrated of the persecuted Hindus from
East Bengal to West Bengal an retaliatory attacks
on Muslim in West Bengal, leading to their
migration. On 8 April, 1950, the Prime Ministers of
India and Pakistan signed an agreement known as
the Nehru-Liaqat pact to resolve the issue of
protection of the minorities. The pact met with the
strong disapproval of the Hindu communalists and
the two ministers from Bengal, Syama Prasad
Mookerjee and K.C. Neogi, resigned from the cabinet
in protest. This incident clearly demonstrates that
communalism has not only led to internal problems
but our relations with neighboring countries have
also been effected by the scourge of communalism.
