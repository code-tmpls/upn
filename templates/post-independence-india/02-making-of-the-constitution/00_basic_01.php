<h3>Making Of The Constitution</h3>

India’s independence represented for its people
the start of an epoch that was imbued with a new
vision. In 1947, the country commenced its long
march to overcome the colonial legacy of economic
underdeveloped-prevalence of disease and stark
social inequality and injustice. 15 August, 1947 was
only the first stop, the first break-the end of colonial
political control. Centuries of backwardness were
now to be overcome, the promises of the freedom
struggle to be fulfilled, and people’s hope to be
met.
<br>
<br>
The tasks of nation-building were taken up by
the Indian people and their leaders with a certain
elan and determination and with confidence in
their capacity to succeed. Jawaharlal Nehru’s
famous ‘Tryst with Destiny’ speech on the eve of
independence reflected this buoyant mood. India
has started off with a broad social consensus on
the basic contours of the India that was to be built
on the values of nationalism, secularism and
democracy. Rapid economic development and
radical social change were other agreed on goals.
These values and goals, and the road to their
achievement, had been mapped over more than
seventy years by the national movement.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AGREEMENT OVER BASIC GOALS</i></strong></div>

The first and the most important task was to
preserve, consolidate and strengthen India’s unity,
to push toward the process of the making of the
Indian nation, and to build up and protect the
national state as an instrument of development and
social transformation. Indian unity had to be
strengthened by recognizing and accepting India’s
immense regional, linguistic, ethnic and religious
diversity.
<br>
<br>
It was agreed that India's revolution had to be
taken beyond the merely political to include
economic and social transformation. The social
scene also called for rapid transformation. Despite
lower-caste movements in several parts of the
country and Gandhiji’s campaign against untouchability society was under severe grip of socioeconomic malaises. Male domination was still nearly
total and women suffered immense social
oppression in the family. Economic development
and a democratic political order were to be
accompanied by rapid social transformation so that
existing gross economic, caste and gender
inequalities were rapidly eliminated, poverty was
removed and the levels of living raised. The
structure of Indian society was to be rapidly
transformed in a broadly socialist direction.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EVOLUTION OF THE CONSTITUTION</i></strong></div>

The national movement had aroused
expectations of a rapid rise in personal and societal
prosperity of social and economic equity and
equality of the good life. Indira Gandhi’s slogan of
‘Garibi Hatao’ in 1971 further fuelled these
expectations as did the process of continuous
politicization since 1950. The constantly rising
aspiration and expections had to be fulfilled as
rapidly as possible and without letting too wide a
gap develop between expectations and fulfillment.
At the same time, political stability had to be
ensured for the accomplishment of all the tasks.
The political system had to combine stability with
growth, social transformation and deepening of the
political process. The Indian revolution had to be
gradual, non-violent and based on political stability,
but it had to be a revolution all the same. First act
of this revolution was to be the evolution of a
constitution as per India needs.
National movement has popularized among the
people the notions of parliamentary democracy,
republicanism, civil liberties, social and economic
justice, which became among the essential
principles of constitution.
<br>
<br>
The actual functioning of the Congress
organization, especially from 1920 onwards, after
Gandhiji modified the Congress constitution, was
based on the elective principle. All office-bearers
were chosen through election. Even more than the
form, it was the spirit of democracy, on which in
the last and first resort the foundations of the
constitution rest, which was inculcated among the
people by the national movement. This found
expression in widespread mass participation. It
ensured a place for adult franchise after
independence. Age for the same was reduced from
21 years to 18 years during time of Rajiv Gandhi.
Elective principle was first introduced by the
British in the Indian Councils Act of 1892. The
Congress and its nationalist precursors and the
Indian Press, had been demanding elections to the
councils, elected majorities in them and greater
powers to the non-official members of councils for
many years before that. Nationalist demands had
already far exceeded what was granted in 1892.
National movement by the end of the second decade
of the twentieth century had begun to espouse the
doctrine of self-determination or the right of Indians
to frame their own constitution.
<br>
<br>
Tilak and Annie Besant had launched a Home
Rule agitation. The Congress-Muslim League
scheme for constitutional reforms emerged out of
the Congress League Pact of 1916. A very
prominent role was played by Motilal Nehru, who
introduced resolution on February 8, 1924 in the
Central Legislative Assembly which asked the
government to summon at an early date, a representative Round Table Conference to recommend
with due regard to the protection of the rights and
interests of important minorities and the scheme of
a constitution for India. This was the first time that
the demand for a constitution and the procedure
for its adoption were spelt out in clear terms.
This resolution, which came to be known as
the ‘National Demand’, was passed by a large
majority in the central Legislative Assembly- 76 for
and 48 against. In May 1928, Congress appointed
a committee chaired by Motilal Nehru to determine
the principles of the constitution for India. The
Nehru Report, submitted on August 10, 1928 was
in effect an outline of a draft constitution for India.
Most of its features were later included in the
Constitution of India. The demand for a
Constituent Assembly was repeated frequently after
1934 and included in the Congress manifesto for
the 1936-37. In 1937, a resolution recommending
replacement of the Government of India Act, 1935
by a constitution framed by a Constituent Assembly
was introduced in the Central Legislative Assembly.
The ‘August Offer’ made by Viceroy Linlithgow
in 1940 in an attempt to secure Indian cooperation
in the war effort for the first time conceded that
the framing of new constitution should be primarily
the responsibility of Indian themselves. The Cripps
proposals were a major advance in the position of
the British government. For the first time, it was
clearly accepted that the constitution would be the
sole responsibility of Indians alone. On February
19, 1946, the British government declared that they
were sending a Cabinet Mission to India to resolve
the whole issue of freedom and constitution making.
The Congress responded to the Cabinet Mission
Scheme by pointing out that in its view the
constituent Assembly, once it came into being,
would be sovereign. It would have the right to
accept or reject the Cabinet Mission’s proposal on
specific lines. Though an assurance on those lines
was not forthcoming from the British, the Congress
nevertheless decided after a great deal of debate to
accept the scheme and try to work it, as there was
a feeling that outright rejection would again delay
the process of transfer of power. The Muslim League
continued to oppose the Constituent Assembly at
every stage, before as well as after it was
constituted.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY</i></strong></div>

The Constituent Assembly was to have 389
members. Of these, 296 were to be from British
India and 93 from the princely Indian states.
Initially, however, the Constituent Assembly
comprised only members from British India.
Elections of these were held in July-August 1946.
Of the 210 seats in the general category, congress
won 199. It also won 3 out of 4 Sikh seats from
Punjab. The total Congress tally was 208. The
Muslim League won 73 out of the 78 Muslim seats.
Especially since the Constituent Assembly was not
elected on the basis of universal adult franchise
and was thus not as truly representative in
character as the Congress had wished and
demanded and also because only Muslims and
Sikhs were recognized as minorities deserving
special representation, special effort was made to
see that the Assembly did indeed reflect the diversity
of perspectives present in the country.
The Congress Working Committee in early July
1946 specifically instructed the Provincial Congress
Committees to include representatives of Scheduled
Castes, Parsis, Indian Christians, Anglo-Indians,
tirbals and women in the Congress list for the
general category. The other important consideration in choosing names for election to the
Assembly was that the very best talent available in
the country must be involved in the task of the
making of the constitution. The lead was given by
Gandhiji himself who suggested the names of
sixteen eminent persons for inclusion in the
Congress list. Altogether thirty people who were
not members of the Congress were thus elected on
the Congress ticket. Having failed to prevent the
election of the Constituent Assembly, the Muslim
League now concentrated its energies on refusing
to join its deliberations.
<br>
<br>
The Congress and Jawaharlal Nehru as
President of the interim government continued to
make conciliatory gestures to Muslim League, but
to no avail. Accordingly, on November 20, 1946,
the decision to convene the first session of the
Constituent Assembly on December 9, 1946 was
announced. At Nehru’s insistence, the oldest
member of the Assembly, Dr. Sachchidanand Sinha,
became the provisional president and invitations
were issued in the name of the secretary of the
Constituent Assembly. In doing this Nehru was
establishing for all to see, the independence of the
Assembly from British control. On December 9,
1946, the Constituent Assembly of India began its
first session. For all practical purposes, the chronicle
of Independent India began on that historic day.
The real responsibility of deciding the
constitutional framework within which the government and people of India were to function had
been transferred and assumed by the Indian people
with the convening of the Constituent Assembly.
The first session was attended by 207 members.
The Muslim League, having failed to prevent the
convening of the Assembly, now refused to join its
deliberations. Consequently, the Seventy six Muslim
members of the League stayed away and the four
Congress Muslim members attended this session.
On December 11, 1946, Dr. Rajendra Prasad was
elected the permanent Chairman, an office later
designated as President of the Assembly On
December 13, 1946. Jawaharlal Nehru moved the
famous Objectives Resolution, which was debated
till December 19 but its adoption was postponed to
enable the represen-tatives of the Muslim League
and the princely states to join.
<br>
<br>
At the next session, which took place from
January 20-22, 1947, it was decided to not wait
any longer for the League, and the Objectives
Resolution was passed. The third session was held
from April 18 to May 2, 1947 and the League still
did not join. On June 3, 1947, the Mountbatten
Plan was announced which made it clear that India
was to be partitioned. The completely altered the
perspective of the Constituent Assembly, as the
Cabinet Mission Plan, the essence of which was
Compromise with the league, was no larger
relevant. With India becoming independent on
August 15, 1947, the Constituent Assembly became
a sovereign body, and also doubled as the
legislature for the new state. It was responsible for
framing the constitution as well as making ordinary
laws. That its function as a legislature as well as its
large size did not come in the way of its effectively
performing it duties as a constitution making body
is due to the enormous preparatory work as well
as organizational skills and hardwork of its leading
members.
<br>
<br>
The work was organized into five stages:
Committees were asked to present reports on basic
issues; B.N. Rau, the constitutional advisor,
prepared an initial draft on the basis of the reports
of these committees and his own research into the
constitutions of other countries; The drafting
committee, chaired by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar,
presented a detailed draft Constitution which was
published for public discussion and comments; The
draft Constitution was discussed and amendments
proposed; and The constitution was adopted.
In addition, a critical role was played by
Congress party. It had asked a committee of experts
to prepare material and proposals for the
constitution as early as July 4, 1946. The committee
was chaired by Nehru and had Asaf Ali, K.T. Shah,
D.R. Gadgil, K.M. Munshi, Humayun Kabir, R.
Shanthanam and N. Gopalaswamy Ayyangar as
members.
<br>
<br>
On 13 December, 1946, Jawaharlal Nehru
introduced the vision of the Constitution-
“Objectives Resolution” in the Constituent
Assembly. It was a momentous resolution that
outlined the defining ideals of the Constitution of
Independent India, and provided the framework
within which the work of constitution-making was
to proceed. It proclaimed India to be an
“Independent Sovereign Republic”, guaranteed its
citizens justice, equality and freedom, and assured
that “adequate safeguards shall be provided for
minorities, backward and tribal areas, and
Depressed and Other Backward Classes…” After
outlining these objectives, Nehru placed the Indian
experiment in a broad historical perspective. As he
spoke, he said, his mind went back to the historic
efforts in the past to produce such documents of
rights. In returning to the past and referring to the
American and French Revolutions, Nehru was
locating the history of constitution-making in India
within a longer history of struggle for liberty and
freedom. The momentous nature of the Indian
project was emphasised by linking it to
revolutionary moments in the past. But Nehru was
not suggesting that those events were to provide
any blueprint for the present; or that the ideas of
those revolutions could be mechanically borrowed
and applied in India. He did not define the specific
form of democracy, and suggested that this had to
be decided through deliberations. And he stressed
that the ideals and provisions of the constitution
introduced in India could not be just derived from
elsewhere. “We are not going just to copy”, he
said. The system of government established in India,
he declared, had to “fit in with the temper of our
people and be acceptable to them”. It was necessary
to learn from the people of the West, from their
achievements and failures, but the Western nations
too had to learn from experiments elsewhere, they
too had to change their own notions of democracy.
The objective of the Indian Constitution would be
to fuse the liberal ideas of democracy with the
socialist idea of economic justice, and re-adapt and
rework all these ideas within the Indian context.
Nehru’s plea was for creative thinking about what
was appropriate for India.
<br>
<br>
The Constituent Assembly had 300 members
Of these, six members played particularly important
roles.Three were representatives of the Congress,
namely, Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabh Bhai Patel and
Rajendra Prasad. It was Nehru who moved the
crucial “Objectives Resolution” which spelt out the
philosophy and basic features of the constitution,
as well as the resolution proposing that the National
Flag of India be a “horizontal tricolour of saffron,
white and dark green in equal proportion”, with a
wheel in navy blue at the centre set a formidable
example by his keen involvement in every aspect
of the process. Patel, on the other hand, worked
mostly behind the scenes, playing a key role in the
drafting of several reports, and working to reconcile
opposing points of view. Sardar Patel’s interest was
second, if at all, only to Nehru’s. He played the
decisive part in bringing in the representatives of
the erstwhile princely states into the Constituent
Assembly, in seeing to it that separate electorates
were eliminated and in scotching any move for
reservation of seats for religions minorities.
Rajendra Prasad’s role was as President of the
Assembly, where he had to steer the discussion
along constructive lines while making sure all
members had a chance to speak. Rajendra Prasad
won acclaim for his impartiality and dignity as
President of the Assembly. Maulana Azad brought
his formidable scholarship and philosophical mind
to bear on many issues of grave importance.
Informed by a strong sense of its historic role in
laying the foundations of independent India, the
Congress party tried hard to do its best by the
people it had led to freedom.
<br>
<br>
Besides these Congress leaders, a very important
member of the Assembly was the lawyer and
economist, B.R. Ambedkar. During the period of
British rule, Ambedkar had been a political
opponent of the Congress; but, on the advice of
Mahatma Gandhi, he was asked at Independence
to join the Union Cabinet as law minister.
Ambedkar himself had the responsibility of guiding
the Draft Constitution through the Assembly. In
this capacity, he served as Chairman of the Drafting
Committee of the Constitution. Serving with him
were two other lawyers, K.M. Munshi from Gujarat
and Alladi Krishnaswamy Aiyyar from Madras,
both of whom gave crucial inputs in the drafting
of the Constitution. These six members were given
vital assistance by two civil servants. One was B.N.
Rau, Constitutional Advisor to the Government of
India, who prepared a series of background papers
based on a close study of the political systems
obtaining in other countries. The other was the
Chief Draughtsman, S.N. Mukherjee, who had the
ability to put complex proposals in clear legal
language.
<br>
<br>
This took three years in all, with the printed
record of the discussions taking up eleven bulky
volumes. But while the process was long it was
also extremely interesting. The members of the
Constituent Assembly were eloquent in expressing
their sometimes very divergent points of view. In
their presentations we can discern many conflicting
ideas of India – of what language Indians should
speak, of what political and economic systems the
nation should follow, of what moral values its
citizens should uphold or disvow.
Between December 1946 and November 1949,
some three hundred Indians had a series of
meetings on the country’s political future. The
meetings of this “Constituent Assembly” were held
in New Delhi, but the participants came from all
over India, and from different political parties.
These discussions resulted in the framing of the
Indian Constitution, which was adopted on 26
January, 1950.
<br>
<br>
Hammered out during intense debates in a
constituent assembly which sat from 1947 to 1949,
India’s constitution established a set of principles
and institutions that have governed the country’s
political life upto the present. Under it, as Nehru
sought to create a ‘modern’ free India, the country
decisively repudiated much of its colonial heritage.
Although remaining a member of the Commonwealth, India was proclaimed a republic, thus
ending its allegiance to the British Crown, when
the constitution was inaugurated. That date, 26
January, known as Republic Day, with a massive
parade in New Delhi, has remained a major focus
for India’s celebration of its nationhood. Rejecting
the imperial vice-regal style of government
associated with the Raj, the new India nevertheless
sought inspiration in domestic British political
practice. The constitution put in place a Westminster
style of government, with a parliament comprising
two houses, and a prime minister selected by the
majority party in the lower house, called the Lok
Sabha or House of the People. Nehru took up the
position of prime minister, while the president,
installed in the old vice-regal palace, acted, like the
sovereign in Britain, as titular head of state. The
old colonial separate electorates, with their divisive
tendencies, were in similar fashion abolished in
favour of single member constituencies, modelled
on those in Britain itself, open to all.
Elements of the old colonial style of governance
nevertheless persisted under the new order. Some
200 articles of the Government of India Act of 1935,
for instance, were incorporated into the new
constitution. The federal structure, in which power
was shared between the centre and the former
provinces, now become states, remained intact. So
too, significantly, did the provision of the 1935 Act
which awarded the provincial governor, and
president, imperial-style power to set aside elected
ministries in times of emergency. These powers were
often employed in independent.
<br>
<br>
India to intimidate recalcitrant state governments, and, in one exceptional instance, to facilitate
a period of authoritarian ‘emergency’ rule throughout the country. In addition, the administrative
structure of the Indian Civil Service, renamed the
Indian Administrative Service, remained in place.
This ‘steel frame’, its British members replaced by
Indians trained in the same spirit of impartial
governance, was seen, in the tumultuous years after
independence, as a necessary bulwark of stability
for the new government. One American idea
incorporated in the new constitution was that of a
Supreme Court with powers of judicial review of
legislation. At no time did the constituent
assembly ever consider instituting a Gandhianstyled nonparty government, with a weak centre
and power diffused among self-governing villages.
The new India was not to be modelled on a vision
of its ancient past.
<br>
<br>
All were agreed that the new India must be
a democratic land, with universal suffrage
and freedom of press and speech. Troubled,
however, by the persisting discrimination against
‘untouch-ables’ and other disadvantaged groups,
the Congress Party took steps to insure that these
groups had a voice in the new constitutional order.
One was the appointment of the distinguished
‘untouchable’ leader Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to chair
the drafting committee for the constitution.
Since their tense stand-off over the Communal
Award in 1932, Ambedkar, a graduate of Columbia
University in New York, had never been reconciled
with Gandhi. Calling Hinduism a ‘veritable
chamber of horrors’, he had argued that all
Gandhism had done was to ‘smoothen its surface
and give it the appearance of decency and
respectability’. Before his death in 1956, Ambedkar
converted to Buddhism. The new constitution itself
outlawed untouchability, but of greater importance
over the long term was the reservation of seats in
the legislatures for the former untouchables, and
with them the depressed forest tribes. These groups
were listed on a special schedule in the constitution,
and so became known as ‘Scheduled Castes and
Tribes’. The members of these castes stood for
election in regular constituencies where they alone
were allowed to be candidates.
<br>
<br>
In this way the state avoided the use of colonialstyle separate electorates, but secured ‘untouchable’
inclusion in the legislature. Their presence offered
visible evidence of the state’s concern for the welfare
of their communities. As time went on, as we shall
see, these reservations grew to include preferential
access to educational institutions and the
administrative services, while the existence of such
benefits for the ‘scheduled’ castes inspired other
‘backward’ classes to demand similar treatment.
The Congress Party under Nehru’s leadership
was committed as well to the principles of
secularism and socialism. Despite the predominance
of Hindus among its membership, the Congress had
always proclaimed itself a secular organization, and
Nehru was determined that India should be a
secular state. In the 1940s and 1950s, especially in
the wake of partition and Gandhi’s assassination,
this principle encountered little overt opposition.
Nehru took care to disassociate the state both from
religion and from the Congress itself, by, for
instance, such measures as installing the lion capital
of the Buddhist ruler Asoka as the central device
on the country’s flag and currency instead of
adopting a Hindu icon or even the Gandhian
spinning wheel which adorned the Congress’s Party
flag. By contrast with its American variant, which
sought to impose a ‘wall’ between church and state,
Indian secularism sought to engage with, and so
sustain, all of India’s various religions. This form of
secularism, with its communally based schools and
codes of law, was hard to put into practice.
Furthermore, the policy encouraged a persisting
allegiance to ‘community’ at odds with the individualism of a democratic polity. The constitution
further enshrined among its directive principles,
not only the fundamental right of private property,
but a commitment to economic justice, defined as
distributing the material resources of the country
in such a way as to promote the common good
and an equitable sharing of wealth.
The Constitution of India came into force on 26
January, 1950. Since then, the day is celebrated as
Republic Day. However, before 1950, 26 January
was called Independence Day. Since 26 January,
1930, it was the day on which thousands of people,
in villages, in mohallas, in towns, in small and big
groups would take the independence pledge,
committing themselves to the complete independence of India from British rule. It was only fitting
that the new republic should come into being on
that day, marking from its very inception the
continuity between the struggle for independence
and the adoption of the Constitution that made
India a Republic.
<br>
<br>
Democracy took a giant step forward with the
first general election held in 1951-52 over a fourmonth period. These elections were the biggest
experiment in democracy anywhere in the world.
The elections were held based on universal adult
franchise, with all those twenty-one years of age
or older having the right to vote. There were over
173 million voters, most of them poor, illiterate,
and rural, and having had no experience of
elections. The big question at the time was how
would the people respond to this opportunity.
Many were skeptical about such an electorate
being able to exercise its right to vote in a politically
mature and responsible manner. Some said that
democratic elections were not suited to a casteridden, multi-religious, illiterate and backward
society like India's and that only a benevolent
dictatorship could be effective politically in such a
society. The coming elections were described by
some as 'a leap in the dark' and by others as
'fantastic' and as 'an act of faith.' India's electoral
system was developed according to the directives
of the Constitution. The Constitution made a
provision for an Election Commission. It was to be
headed by a Chief Election Commissioner, to
conduct elections. It was to be independent of the
executive or the parliament or the party in power.
Organization of the elections was a wondrous
task. There was a house-to-house survey to register
the voters. With over 70 per cent of the voters being
illiterate, the candidates were to be identified by
symbols, assigned to each major party and
independent candidates, painted on the ballot-boxes
(this was later changed to symbols on the ballot
papers). The voters were to place the ballot papers
in the box assigned to a particular candidate, and
ballot was secret. Over 224,000 polling booths, one
for almost every 1000 voters, were constructed and
equipped with over 21/2 million steel ballot-boxes,
one box for every candidate. Nearly 620,000,000
ballot papers were printed. About a million officials
supervised the conduct of the polls. Of the many
candidates, whoever got the plurality, or the largest
number of votes would be elected. It was not
necessary for the winning candidate to have a
majority.
<br>
<br>
sIn all, candidates of over fourteen national and
sixty-three regional or local parties and a large
number of independents contested 489 seats for
the Lok Sabha and 3,283 seats for the state
assemblies. Of these, 98 seats for the former and
669 for the latter were reserved for the Scheduled
Castes and the Scheduled Tribes. Nearly 17,500
candidates in all stood for the seats to the Lok
Sabha and the state legislatures. The elections were
spread out over nearly four months from 25
October, 1951 to 21 February, 1952.
Suitable conditions were created for the free
participation of the opposition parties in the
elections, including Jan Sangh and CPI. The
Opposition was, however, quite fragmented.
