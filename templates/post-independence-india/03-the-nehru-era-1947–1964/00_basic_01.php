<h3>The Nehru Era (1947-1964)</h3>

Jawaharlal Nehru was the first Prime Minister
of India. His Prime-Ministership was marked by
social and economic reforms of the Indian state. A
number of foreign policy landmarks like the
founding of the Non-Aligned Movement also
marked the tenure of Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime
Minister.
<br>
<br>
Jawaharlal Nehru became Prime Minister on
the 15th of August, 1947. His ascension was
plagued by controversy and a bitter power struggle
within the Congress Party. The internal struggle of
the party was symptomatic of the larger struggle
within the Indian Republic itself. The initial period
of Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister was marked
by communal violence.
<br>
<br>
Jawaharlal Nehru was forced to concede the
creation of Pakistan as per the wishes of the Muslim
League leader the leadership of Muhammad Ali
Jinnah. Communal violence enveloped the entire
country during this period. Maximum bloodshed
was witnessed in the national capital Delhi. The
Indian states of Punjab and West Bengal also
witnessed fierce bloodshed.
The first Prime Minister tried to defuse the
explosive situation by visiting the violence affected
areas. He toured the riot stricken areas with
Pakistani leaders to reassure those affected by the
violence. Nehru promoted peace in Punjab during
that momentous period in Indian history. The
secular nature of Jawaharlal Nehru was best
exemplified during those times. He took active steps
to safeguard the status of Indian Muslims.
India held its first national elections under the
Constitution in 1952, where a turnout of over 60%
was recorded. The National Congress Party won
an overwhelming majority, and Jawaharlal Nehru
began a second term as Prime Minister. President
Prasad was also elected to a second term by the
electoral college of the first Parliament of India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEHRU ADMINISTRATION (1952–1964)</i></strong></div>

The 1951-52 election swept the Congress Party
into power at national and state levels alike. In the
new Lok Sabha the party won 364 of the 489 seats.
This electoral victory, capitalizing as it did upon
the appeal of the Congress as the party that had
brought independence to India, and wrapping itself
in the saintly legacy of the martyred Mahatma
Gandhi, was hardly surprising. Support for the
Congress was, however, by no means universal.
Indeed, of the votes cast, the Congress secured only
some 45 per cent. The remainder was split amongst
an array of opposition parties, rightist, leftist, and
regional, pushed to the margins by Congress’s
domination of the political centre. This disjuncture
between the Congress Party’s limited popular
appeal, and its domination of the legislature, was
to be a feature of Indian politics for decades to
come.
<br>
<br>
The first two decades of India’s independence
can aptly be characterized as the age of Nehru.
Several elements together shaped the political life
of the country through the 1950s and into the
1960s. These include a politics of brokerage, a
commitment to economic development, and a
struggle to contain fissiparous linguistic regionalism.
All were knitted together by Nehru’s commanding presence. Forced for the first years of his
rule to share power with the imperious Sardar
Vallabhbhai Patel, after Patel’s death in 1950 Nehru
successfully turned back the sole remaining
challenge to his authority, that of Purushottam Das
Tandon at the head of the Congress Working
Committee. From then on until his death in 1964,
Nehru was unchallenged master of the Indian
scene. Operating from a position of unquestioned
strength, but never ruthless or vindictive, Nehru
impressed his will upon the administrative services,
the military, and the legislature. Nehru represented
the newly independent India to itself, as well as
to the world at large.
<br>
<br>
Prime Minister Nehru, with his charismatic
brilliance, led the Congress to major election
victories in 1957 and 1962. The Parliament passed
extensive reforms that increased the legal rights of
women in Hindu society, and further legislated
against caste discrimination and untouchability.
Nehru advocated a strong initiative to enroll India's
children to complete primary education, and
thousands of schools, colleges and institutions of
advanced learning, such as the Indian Institutes of
Technology were founded across the nation. Nehru
advocated a socialist model for the economy of
India — no taxation for Indian farmers, minimum
wage and benefits for blue-collar workers, and
the nationalisation of heavy industries such as steel,
aviation, shipping, electricity and mining. An
extensive public works and industrialization
campaign resulted in the construction of major
dams, irrigation canals, roads, thermal and
hydroelectric power stations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>STATES REORGANIZATION</i></strong></div>

Demand of states on linguistic basis was
developed even before independence of India under
British rule. Though that time Indian administrative regions were identified as different
provinces. Odisha was the first Indian state formed
on linguistic basis in the year 1936 due to the efforts
of Madhusudan Das and became Orissa Province.
In Odisha, linguistic movement started in the year
1895 and intensified later years with the demand
of separate province from Bihar and Orissa
Province.
<br>
<br>
The reorganization of the states based on
language, a major aspect of national consolidation
and integration, came to the fore almost immediately
after independence. The boundaries of provinces
in pre-1947 India had been drawn in a haphazard
manner as the British conquest of India had
proceeded for nearly a hundred years. No heed
was paid to linguistic or cultural cohesion so that
most of the provinces were multi-lingual and multicultural. The interspersed princely states had added
a further element of heterogeneity.
<br>
<br>
The case for linguistic states as administrative
units was very strong. Language is closely related
to culture and therefore to the customs of people.
Besides, the massive spread of education and
growth of mass literacy can only occur through
the medium of the mother tongue. After independence, the demand for the reorganization of states
on linguistic basis was raised from different regions.
The Constitution Assembly appointed S.K. Dhar
Commission in Nov. 1947 to study the issue of
reorganization of States on linguistic basis. The
commission in its report, submitted in 1948,
recommended against the organization of states
purely on linguistic basis. Instead, the commission
suggested the following criteria alongwith
language- Geographical contiguity, Financial selfreliance, Administrative viability and Potential for
development.
<br>
<br>
The Congress, in its Jaipur session in 1948,
appointed a three member committee to consider
the recommendations of Dhar Commission.
The Committee is popularly known as JVP
Committee after the name of its three members –
Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabh Bhai Patel, and Pattabhi
Sitarammaiah. The committee rejected language as
the basis of reorganization of states. It suggested
that the security, unity and economic prosperity of
the nation as the criteria of reorganization.
The Congress Working Committee accepted its
recommendation in 1949.
<br>
<br>
Potti Sreeramulu's fast-unto-death, and
consequent death for the demand of an Andhra
State in 1953 sparked a major re-shaping of the
Indian Union. In December 1953, Prime Minister
Jawaharlal Nehru appointed the States Reorganization to reorganize the Indian states. This was
headed by the retired chief Justice of supreme court
Fazal Ali and the commission itself was also known
as the Fazal Ali Commission. The other two
members of the commission were Mr. Hridaynath
and Mr. K.M. Panikkar. The efforts of this
commission were overseen by Govind Ballabh Pant,
who served as Home Minister from December 1954.
The commission created a report on September 30,
1955 recommending the reorganization of India's
states. The parliament debated on the report. Some
of the important recommendations of the
Commission were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Indian Union was to consist of 16 States
as against the existing 27 and three centrally
administered territories.</li>
        <li>Special safeguards were recommended for
linguistic minorities.</li>
        <li>In the interests of national unity and good
administration, the Commission—recommended the reconstitution of certain All
India Services. It further recommended that
at least 50 per cent of the new entrants to
the All India Services and at least one third
of the number of Judges in a High Court
should consist of persons recruited from
outside that State so that, administration
might inspire confidence and help in
arresting parochial trends.</li>
        <li>The Commission put emphasis on the need
for encouraging the study of Indian
languages other than Hindi but, for some
time to come, English continue to occupy
an important place in the universities and
institutions of higher learning.</li>
        <li>The Commission rejected the demand for
the creation of a Punjabi Speaking State
(Punjabi Suba) because “the creation of such
a state will solve neither the language nor
the communal problem”.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Finally, a bill making changes in the constitution
and reorganizing states was passed and was
implemented from November 1, 1956. The States
Reorganization Act was enacted on 31 August,
1956. Before it came into effect on 1 November, an
important amendment to the Constitution was also
enacted; this amendment (the Seventh) was timed
to come into force on the same day.
<br>
<br>
Under the Seventh Amendment, the existing
distinction among Part A, Part B, Part C, and Part
D states was abolished. The distinction between
Part A and Part B states was removed, becoming
known simply as "states". A new type of entity,
the union territory, replaced the classification as a
Part C or Part D state. It provided for fourteen
states and six centrally administered territories. The
Telengana area of Hyderabad state was transferred
to Andhra; merging the Malabar district of the old
Madras Presidency with Travancore-Cochin
created Kerala. Certain Kannada-speaking areas
of the states of Bombay, Madras, Hyderabad and
Coorg were added to the Mysore state. Merging
the states of Kutch and Saurashtra and the Marathispeaking areas of Hyderabad with it enlarged
Bombay state. But two of the most sensitive area,
Bombay and Punjab, were not reorganized on
linguistic basis. The demands for separate tribal
states, including Jharkhand and Nagaland, were
also bypassed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC POLICIES</i></strong></div>

Nehru implemented policies based on import
substitution industrialization and advocated
a mixed economy where the government controlled public sector would co-exist with the private
sector. He believed that the establishment of basic
and heavy industry was fundamental to the
development and modernization of the Indian
economy. The government therefore directed
investment primarily into key public sector
industries – steel, iron, coal, and power – promoting
their development with subsidies and protectionist
policies. The policy of non-alignment during
the Cold War meant that Nehru received financial
and technical support from both power blocs in
building India's industrial base from scratch. Steel
mill complexes were built at Bokaro and
Rourkela with assistance from the Soviet Union and
West Germany.
<br>
<br>
Five-Year Plans (FYPs) are centralized and
integrated national economic programs and were
implemented immediately after independence under
socialist influence of first Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru. The Planning Commission was set up in
March 1950. The main objective of the Government
was to promote a rapid rise in the standard of
living of the people by efficient exploitation of the
resources of the country increasing production and
offering opportunities to all for employment in the
service of the community. The Planning Commission was charged with the responsibility of making
assessment of all resources of the country,
augmenting deficient resources, formulating plans
for the most effective and balanced utilization of
resources and determining priorities. The first
Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru presented
the first five-year plan to the Parliament of India
on December 8, 1951. This plan was based on the
Harrod-Domar model.
<br>
<br>
 The First Five-Year Plan was one of the most
important because it had a great role in the
launching of Indian development after the
Independence. Thus, it strongly supported
agriculture production and it also launched the
industrialization of the country (but less than the
Second Plan, which focused on heavy industries).
It built a particular system of mixed economy, with
a great role for the public sector (with an
emerging welfare state), as well as a growing
private sector (represented by some personalities
as those who published the Bombay Plan).
The total planned budget of Rs. 2069 crore was
allocated to seven broad areas: irrigation and
energy (27.2%), agriculture and community development (17.4%), transport and communications
(24%), industry (8.4%), social services (16.64%),
land rehabilitation (4.1%), and for other sectors
and services (2.5%). The most important feature of
this phase was active role of state in all economic
sectors. Such a role was justified at that time
because immediately after independence, India was
facing basic problems—deficiency of capital and
low capacity to save.
<br>
<br>
The target growth rate was 2.1% annual gross
domestic product (GDP) growth; the achieved
growth rate was 3.6% the net domestic product
went up by 15%. The monsoon was good and there
were relatively high crop yields, boosting exchange
reserves and the per capita income, which increased by 8%. National income increased more than
the per capita income due to rapid population
growth. Many irrigation projects were initiated
during this period, including the Bhakra Dam and
Hirakud Dam. The World Health Organization
(WHO), with the Indian government, addressed
children's health and reduced infant mortality,
indirectly contributing to population growth.
At the end of the plan period in 1956,
five Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) were
started as major technical institutions. The
University Grant Commission (UGC) was set up to
take care of funding and take measures to
strengthen the higher education in the country.
Contracts were signed to start five steel plants,
which came into existence in the middle of the
Second Five-Year Plan. The plan was quasi
successful for the government.
<br>
<br>
The Second Plan, particularly in the development of the public sector. The plan followed
the Mahalanobis model, an economic development
model developed by the Indian statistician Prasanta
Chandra Mahalanobis in 1953. The plan attempted
to determine the optimal allocation of investment
between productive sectors in order to maximise
long-run economic growth. It used the prevalent
state of art techniques of operations research and
optimization as well as the novel applications of
statistical models developed at the Indian Statistical
Institute. The plan assumed a closed economy in
which the main trading activity would be centred
on importing capital goods.
Hydroelectric power projects and five steel
plants at Bhilai, Durgapur, and Rourkela were
established. Coal production was increased.
More railway lines were added in the northeast.
The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research was
established as a research institute. In 1957, a talent
search and scholarship program was begun to find
talented young students to train for work in nuclear
power.
<br>
<br>
The total amount allocated under the Second
Five-Year Plan in India was Rs.48 billion. This
amount was allocated among various sectors: power
and irrigation, social services, communications and
transport, and miscellaneous. The target growth rate
was 4.5% and the actual growth rate was 4.27%.
There was substantial industrial development.
Industry grew 7.0 per cent annually between 1950
and 1965 – almost trebling industrial output and
making India the world's seventh largest industrial
country. Nehru's critics, however, contended that
India's import substitution industrialization, which
was continued long after the Nehru era, weakened
the international competitiveness of its manufacturing industries. GDP and GNP grew 3.9 and 4.0
per cent annually between 1950–51 and 1964–65. It
was a radical break from the British colonial period.
But, in comparison to other industrial powers in
Europe and East Asia, the growth rates were
considered anaemic at best. India lagged behind
the miracle economies (Japan, West Germany,
France, and Italy). State planning, controls, and
regulations were argued to have impaired economic
growth. While India's economy grew faster than
both the United Kingdom and the United States–
low initial income and rapid population increase–
meant that growth was inadequate for any sort of
catch-up with rich income nations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AGRICULTURE POLICIES</i></strong></div>

Under Nehru's leadership, the government
attempted to develop India quickly by embarking
on agrarian reform and rapid industrialization. A
successful land reform was introduced that
abolished giant landholdings, but efforts to
redistribute land by placing limits on landownership
failed. Attempts to introduce large-scale cooperative
farming were frustrated by landowning rural elites,
who formed the core of the powerful right-wing of
the Congress and had considerable political support
in opposing the efforts of Nehru. Agricultural
production expanded until the early 1960s, as
additional land was brought under cultivation and
some irrigation projects began to have an effect.
The establishment of agricultural universities,
modelled after land-grant colleges in the United
States, contributed to the development of the
economy. These universities worked with highyielding varieties of wheat and rice, initially
developed in Mexico and the Philippines, that in
the 1960s began the Green Revolution, an effort to
diversify and increase crop production. At the same
time a series of failed monsoons would cause serious
food shortages despite the steady progress and
increase in agricultural production.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SOCIAL POLICIES</i></strong></div>

Jawaharlal Nehru was a passionate advocate
of education for India's children and youth,
believing it essential for India's future progress. His
government oversaw the establishment of many
institutions of higher learning, including the All
India Institute of Medical Sciences, the Indian
Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of
Management and the National Institutes of
Technology. Nehru also outlined a commitment in
his five-year plans to guarantee free and
compulsory primary education to all of India's
children. For this purpose, Nehru oversaw the
creation of mass village enrollment programmes and
the construction of thousands of schools. Nehru
also launched initiatives such as the provision of
free milk and meals to children to fight malnutrition.
Adult education centres, vocational and technical
schools were also organized for adults, especially
in the rural areas.
<br>
<br>
Under Nehru, the Indian Parliament enacted
many changes to Hindu law to criminalise caste
discrimination and increase the legal rights and
social freedoms of women. A system of reservations
in government services and educational institutions
was created to eradicate the social inequalities and
disadvantages faced by peoples of the scheduled
castes and scheduled tribes. Nehru also championed
secularism and religious harmony, increasing the
representation of minorities in government.
Most notably, Nehru allowed Muslims to keep
their personal law in matters relating to marriage
and inheritance. Also in the small state of Goa, a
civil code based on the old Portuguese Family Laws
was allowed to continue, and Muslim Personal law
was prohibited by Nehru. This was the result of
the annexation of Goa in 1961 by India, when
Nehru promised the people that their laws would
be left intact. This has led to accusations of selective
secularism.
<br>
<br>
While Nehru exempted Muslim law from
legislation and they remained un-reformed, he did
pass the Special Marriage Act in 1954. The idea
behind this act was to give everyone in India the
ability to marry outside the personal law under a
civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of
India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading
to accusations of selective secularism). In many
respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu
Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to
how secularised the law regarding Hindus had
become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims
to marry under it and thereby retain the protections,
generally beneficial to Muslim women, that could
not be found in the personal law. Under the act
polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and
succession would be governed by the Indian
Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim
Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by
the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced
wife would be along the lines set down in the civil
law.
<br>
<br>
Nehru led the faction of the Congress party
which promoted Hindi as the ligua-franca of the
Indian nation. After an exhaustive and divisive
debate with the non-Hindi speakers, Hindi was
adopted as the official language of India in 1950
with English continuing as an associate official
language for a period of fifteen years, after which
Hindi would become the sole official language.
Efforts by the Indian Government to make Hindi
the sole official language after 1965 were not
acceptable to many non-Hindi Indian states, who
wanted the continued use of English. The Dravida
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a descendant of
Dravidar Kazhagam, led the opposition to Hindi.
To allay their fears, Nehru enacted the Official
Languages Act in 1963 to ensure the continuing
use of English beyond 1965. The text of the Act did
not satisfy the DMK and increased their scepticism
that his assurances might not be honoured by future
administrations. The issue was resolved during the
premiership of Lal Bahadur Shastri, who assured
that English would continue to be used as the
official language as long the non-Hindi speaking
states wanted. The Official Languages Act was
eventually amended in 1967 by the Congress
Government headed by Indira Gandhi to guarantee
the indefinite use of Hindi and English as official
languages. This effectively ensured the current
"virtual indefinite policy of bilingualism" of the
Indian Republic.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MILITARY CONFLICTS AND WARS</i></strong></div>

In 1961, after continual petitions for a peaceful
handover, India invaded and annexed the Portuguese colony of Goa on the west coast of India.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indo-China War (1962)</i></strong></div>    
        
India adopted a policy of friendship towards
China from the very beginning. The Congress had
been sympathetic to China's struggle against
imperialism and had sent a medical mission to
China in the thirties as well as given a call for
boycott of Japanese goods in protest against
Japanese occupation of China. India was the first
to recognize the new People's Republic of China
on 1 January, 1950. Nehru had great hopes that
the two countries with their common experience
of suffering at the hands of colonial powers and
common problems of poverty and underdevelopment would join hands to give Asia its due
place in the world. Nehru pressed for representation
for Communist China in the UN Security Council,
did not support the US position in the Korean War,
and tried his best to bring about a settlement in
Korea.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In 1950, when China occupied Tibet, India was
unhappy that it had not been taken into confidence,
but did not question China's rights over Tibet since
at many times in Chinese history Tibet had been
subjugated by China. In 1954, India and China
signed a treaty in which India recognized China's
rights over Tibet and the two countries agreed to
be governed in their mutual relations by the
principles of Panchsheel. Differences over border
delineation were discussed at this time but China
maintained that it had not yet studied the old
Kuomintang maps and these could be sorted out
later.
In 1959, however, there was a big revolt in
Tibet and the Dalai Lama fled Tibet along with
thousands of refugees. He was given asylum in
India but not allowed to set up a government-inexile and dissuaded from carrying on political
activities. Soon after, in October 1959, Chinese
opened fire on an Indian patrol near the Kongka
Pass in Ladakh. China refused to accept the
McMahon Line and Beijing laid claims to 50,000
square miles of territory in Sikkim and Bhutan.
Chinese troops fire on an Indian patrol in the Aksai
Chin area killing nine soldiers and capturing ten.
Letters were exchanged between the two
governments, but a common ground did not
emerge. Then, Chou En-lai was invited for talks to
Delhi in April 1960, but not much headway could
be made and it was decided to let officials sort out
the details first.
<br>
<br>
In June 1960, Chinese troops violate the Indian
border near Shipki village in the northeast and
China further occupies 12,000 sq. miles in the
western sector. In October 1961, Chinese start
aggressive border patrolling and establishes new
military formations which start moving into Indian
territory. India adopts the Forward Policy to stem
the advancing Chinese frontier line by establishing
a few border outposts.
China issues ultimatum demanding the
withdrawal of the Indian frontier personnel from
the border posts. In September 1962, Chinese forces
cross the McMahon Line in the Thag La region in
the east and open fire on an Indian post. Launch
another intensified attack.
<br>
<br>
China launches a massive multi-pronged attack
all along the border from Ladakh in the west to
Arunachal Pradesh in the east. A massive Chinese
attack on the eastern front. Tawang and Walong
in the eastern sector over run, Rezang La and the
Chushul airport in the west shelled. Chinese troops
capture Bomdi La in the NEFA region. In 1962,
China declares a unilateral ceasefire along the entire
border and announces withdrawal of its troops to
20 km behind the LAC.
After the war, China retained de facto control
of the Aksai Chin India stabilized along the Line of
Actual Control. The war precipitated as well a
massive diversion of funds from development to
the military, which, neglected, had remained
unchanged from the colonial era. The aftermath of
the war saw sweeping changes in the Indian
military to prepare it for similar conflicts in the
future, and placed pressure on Indian Prime
Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was seen as
responsible for failing to anticipate the Chinese
attack on India. Indians reacted with a surge in
patriotism and memorials were erected for many
of the Indian troops who died in the war. Arguably,
the main lesson India learned from the war was
the need to strengthen its own defenses and a shift
from Nehru's foreign policy with China based on
his stated concept of "brotherhood". Because of
India's inability to anticipate Chinese aggression, Prime Minister Nehru faced harsh criticism
from government officials, for having promoted
pacifist relations with China. The war also put an
end to Nehru's earlier hopes that India and China
would form a strong Asian Axis to counteract the
increasing influence of the Cold War bloc superpowers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIA’S FOREIGN POLICY</i></strong></div>

India’s post-independence policymakers were
acutely sensitive to the significance of the colonial
legacy. Accordingly, they explicitly sought to forge
a pathway that would keep India outside the ambit
of the Cold War. Such a strategy was possible
because anti-imperialist sentiments were widespread within the Indian polity across the political
spectrum. This strategy came to be known as nonalignment and Indian policymakers were at pains
to distinguish it from “neutralism”.
The real architect of this policy was Prime
Minister Nehru. Even though he was temperamentally a Western liberal, he was deeply skeptical
of the United States. In part, his skepticism was
the consequence of his highly Anglicized personal
and professional background. In effect, he had come
to share the British upper class disdain for the
United States. His views toward the Soviet Union
were more ambivalent. He was also cognizant of
the horrors of Stalin’s collectivist enterprise though
admiring of the achievements of the forced-draught
industrialization program. His partiality toward the
USSR also stemmed from his own social democratic
predilections.
<br>
<br>
At least two factors can be adduced to explain
Nehru’s adoption of non-alignment as the lodestar
of India’s foreign policy. First, he was acutely
concerned about the opportunity costs of defense
spending. Any involvement with the two emerging
blocs, he feared, would draw India into the titanic
struggle and divert critical resources from economic
development. Second, he was intent on maintaining
India’s hard-won independence. Moving into the
ambit of either superpower could compromise such
freedom of maneuver.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE PATHWAY TO 1962</i></strong></div>

From the time of independence to the disastrous
border conflict with China, three key features
characterized India’s foreign policy. First, India
played a significant role in multilateral institutions
and particularly in United Nations peacekeeping
operations. Second, it also emerged as a critical
proponent of the non-aligned movement. Third, as
a leader of the non-aligned movement it also made
a significant contribution toward the process of
decolonization.
<br>
<br>
These three critical commitments, in turn,
manifested themselves at global, regional and
national levels. At a global level, India attempted
to defuse Cold War tensions in a number of
contexts regional and functional. To that end, India
had emerged as one of the early proponents of a
nuclear test ban treaty and in 1952 had introduced
a draft resolution co-sponsored with Ireland to
bring about a global ban on nuclear tests. In the
event, thanks to the exigencies of Cold War politics,
little or nothing came of this effort. Nevertheless,
this endeavor was a manifestation of India’s interest
in forging a particular global order, one which
would hobble the use of force in international
affairs. India also sought to play a vital role in
United Nations peacekeeping operations as well as
the peaceful resolution of regional disputes. In
pursuit of these ends India became involved in the
International Control Commission in Vietnam along
with Canada and Poland, it was a key member of
the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission in
Korea and it also made a significant troop
contribution in the United Nations Peacekeeping
forces in the Belgian Congo. Also, India proved to
be a tireless campaigner in the effort to bring about
the end of decolonization. To that end, India’s
diplomacy was carefully geared to the discussion
of the issue at various international forum and
especially in the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).
In the region, it referred the Kashmir dispute
with Pakistan to the United Nations for possible
resolution. To the dismay of its policymakers, the
issue became quickly embroiled in the politics of
the Cold War. As a consequence of the largely
partisan discussions at the United Nations, India’s
political leadership became increasingly
disillusioned about the resolution of its bilateral
territorial disputes through the mechanism of the
United Nations. Not surprisingly, after extensive
diplomatic discussion with the intransigent Salazar
regime in Portugal produced a deadlock and Prime
Minister Nehru faced increasing criticism from a
group of Afro-Asian leaders, India chose to use
force to oust the Portuguese from their colonial
enclave in Goa in 1960.
<br>
<br>
Finally, at national level, the country’s
commitment to nonalignment led to the adoption
of particular set of significant policy choices.
Specifically, one of the key elements of the doctrine
of non-alignment was the limitation of high defense
expenditures. To this end Indian military
expenditures were drastically limited even when
steady evidence about a possible security threat from
the People’s Republic of China (PRC) continued to
mount. Such a policy, unfortunately, proved to be
extremely costly when the border negotiations with
the PRC ultimately reached a cul-de-sac in 1960.
Faced with this situation, India embarked upon a
strategy of compellence designed to restore what it
deemed to be the territorial status quo along the
disputed Himalayan border. This policy, however,
was singularly ill-conceived as it involved sending
in lightly armed, poorly equipped and ill-prepared
troops to high altitudes in “penny packets”. In
October 1962, when the People’s Liberation Army
(PLA) attacked with considerable force, the Indian
military was grossly unprepared to face the
onslaught. The PLA inflicted considerable losses
on the Indian forces and then withdrew from some
of the areas that they had entered. However, they
did not vacate some 14,000 square miles that they
had initially claimed. These territories and other
still remain the subject of tortured and glacial
border negotiations.

While assertive in his Indianness, Nehru never
exuded the Hindu aura and atmosphere clinging
to Gandhi’s personality. Because of his modern
political and economic outlook, he was able to
attract the younger intelligentsia of India to
Gandhi’s movement of non-violent resistance
against the British and later to rally them around
him after independence had been gained. Nehru’s
Western upbringing and his visits to Europe before
independence had acclimatized him to Western
ways of thinking. Throughout his 17 years in office,
he held up democratic socialism as the guiding star.
With the help of the overwhelming majority that
the Congress Party maintained in Parliament during
his term of office, he advanced toward that goal.
The four pillars of his domestic policies were
democracy, socialism, unity, and secularism. He
succeeded to a large extent in maintaining the edifice
supported by these four pillars during his lifetime.
