<h3>Lal Bahadur Shastri 1964-1966</h3>

After the death of Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru in 1964 Gulzarilal Nanda became interim
Prime Minister for thirteen days. His term was
uneventful, yet it was sensitive of period because
of the potential danger to the country following
Nehru's death soon after a war with China in 1962.
Lal Bahadur Shastri (born 1904) succeeded
Jawaharlal Nehru as Prime Minister of India in
1964. Though eclipsed by such stalwarts of the
Congress party as Kamaraj (the Kingmaker) and
Morarji Desai, Finance Minister in Nehru's
government, Shastri emerged as the consensus
candidate in the midst of party warfare. Accepting
the limited character of his political mandate, Shastri
did not make any major changes in Nehru's
Cabinet, except for persuading Indira Gandhi,
Nehru’s daughter, to join it as Minister of
Information and Broadcasting. Under him, the
cabinet ministers functioned more autonomously.
He also did not interfere in party affairs or with
the working of the state governments. On the
whole, he kept a low political profile except towards
the end of his administration.
<br>
<br>
The problem of the official language of Hindi
versus English, flared up in early 1965, but the
central government failed to handle it effectively
and allowed the situation to deteriorate. The
problem was, however, finally resolved in early
1966. The demands for Punjabi Suba (state) and
Goa's merger with Maharashtra were also allowed
to simmer.
During his tenure the country was facing huge
challenges. There was food shortage in the country
and on the security front Pakistan was creating
problems. In 1965, Pakistan tried to take advantage
of India's vulnerability and attacked India. Mildmannered Lal Bahadur Shastri rose to the occasion
and led the country ably. To enthuse soldiers and
farmers he coined the slogan of "Jai Jawan, Jai
Kishan". In January 1966, to broke peace between
India and Pakistan, Russia mediated a meeting
between Lal Bahadur Shastri and Ayub Khan in
Tashkent, Russia. India and Pakistan signed the
joint declaration under Russian mediation. Under
the treaty India agreed to return to Pakistan all the
territories occupied by it during the war. The joint
declaration was signed on January 10, 1966 and
Lal Bahadur Shastri died of heart attack on the
same night.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC POLICIES</i></strong></div>

Shastri continued Nehru's socialist economic
policies with central planning. He promoted the
White Revolution – a national campaign to increase
the production and supply of milk – by supporting
the Amul milk co-operative of Anand, Gujarat and
creating the National Dairy Development Board.
Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri, Prime Minister of
India, visited Anand on 31 October, 1964 for
inauguration of the Cattle Feed Factory of Amul at
Kanjari. As he was keenly interested in knowing
the success of this co-operative and discusses his
wish to Mr. Verghese Kurien, then the General
Manager of Kaira District Co-operative Milk
Producers’ Union Ltd. (Amul) to replicate this
model to other parts of the country for improving
the socio-economic conditions of farmers. As a result
of this visit, the National Dairy Development Board
(NDDB) was established at Anand in 1965.
While speaking on the chronic food shortages
across the country, Shastri urged people to
voluntarily give up one meal so that the saved food
could be distributed to the affected populace. He
himself motivated the countrymen to maximize the
cultivation of food grains by ploughing the lawn in
his official residence in New Delhi.
Shastri hated the idea of going around with a
begging bowl. So he hit upon a novel idea. He
went on air to appeal to his countrymen to skip a
meal a week. The response was overwhelming.
Even restaurants and eateries downed the shutters
on Monday evenings. Many parts of the country
observed the “Shastri Vrat”. First he implemented
the system in his own family before appealing to
the countrymen.
<br>
<br>
During the 22-day war with Pakistan in 1965,
On October 19, 1965, Shastri gave the seminal ‘Jai
Jawan Jai Kishan’ ("Hail the soldier, Hail the
farmer") slogan at Urwa in Allahabad that became
a national slogan.
<br>
<br>
Underlining the need to boost India's food
production, Shastri also promoted the Green
Revolution. Though he was a socialist, Shastri stated
that India cannot have a regimented type of
economy.
The Food Corporation of India was setup under
the Food Corporation's Act 1964. Also the National
Agricultural Products Board Act was passed during
his tenure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THIRD FIVE-YEAR PLAN</i></strong></div>

The Third Five-year Plan stressed agriculture
and improvement in the production of wheat, but
the brief Sino-Indian War of 1962 exposed
weaknesses in the economy and shifted the focus
towards the defence industry and the Indian Army.
In 1965–1966, India fought a War with Pakistan.
There was also a severe drought in 1965. The war
led to inflation and the priority was shifted to price
stabilisation. The construction of dams continued.
Many cement and fertilizer plants were also
built. Punjab began producing an abundance
of wheat.
<br>
<br>
Many primary schools were started in rural
areas. In an effort to bring democracy to the grassroot level, Panchayat elections were started and
the states were given more development responsibilities.
State electricity boards and state secondary
education boards were formed. States were made
responsible for secondary and higher education.
State road transportation corporations were formed
and local road building became a state responsibility.
The target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual
growth rate was 2.4%.
<br>
<br>
Due to miserable failure of the Third Plan the
government was forced to declare "plan holidays"
(from 1966–67, 1967–68, and 1968–69). Three
annual plans were drawn during this intervening
period. During 1966–67, there was again the
problem of drought. Equal priority was given to
agriculture, its allied activities, and industrial sector.
The main reasons for plan holidays were the war,
lack of resources, and increase in inflation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAJOR EVENTS</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Second Indo-Pakistan War (1965)</i></strong></div>
 
The 1965 war between India and Pakistan was
the second conflict between the two countries over
the status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The
clash did not resolve this dispute, but it did engage
the United States and the Soviet Union in ways
that would have important implications for
subsequent superpower involvement in the region.
The state of Jammu and Kashmir, which had a
predominantly Muslim population but a Hindu
leader, shared borders with both India and West
Pakistan. The argument over which nation would
incorporate the state led to the first India-Pakistan
War in 1947–48 and ended with UN mediation.
Jammu and Kashmir, also known as “Indian
Kashmir” or just “Kashmir,” joined the Republic
of India, but the Pakistani Government continued
to believe that the majority Muslim state rightfully
belonged to Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
Conflict resumed again in early 1965, when
Pakistani and Indian forces clashed over disputed
territory along the border between the two nations.
Hostilities intensified that August when the
Pakistani army attempted to take Kashmir by force.
The attempt to seize the state was unsuccessful,
and the second India-Pakistan War reached a
stalemate. This time, the international politics of
the Cold War affected the nature of the conflict.
The United States had a history of ambivalent
relations with India. During the 1950s, U.S. officials
regarded Indian leadership with some caution due
to India’s involvement in the non-aligned
movement, particularly its prominent role at the
Bandung Conference of 1955. The United States
hoped to maintain a regional balance of power,
which meant not allowing India to influence the
political development of other states. However, a
1962 border conflict between India and China
ended with a decisive Chinese victory, which
motivated the United States and the United
Kingdom to provide military supplies to the Indian
army. After the clash with China, India also turned
to the Soviet Union for assistance, which placed
some strains on U.S.-Indian relations. However, the
United States also provided India with considerable
development assistance throughout the 1960s and
1970s.
<br>
<br>
U.S.-Pakistani relations had been more
consistently positive. The U.S. Government looked
to Pakistan as an example of a moderate Muslim
state and appreciated Pakistani assistance in
holding the line against communist expansion by
joining the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization
(SEATO) in 1954 and the Baghdad Pact (later
renamed the Central Treaty Organization, or
(CENTO) in 1955. Pakistan’s interest in these pacts
stemmed from its desire to develop its military and
defensive capabilities, which were substantially
weaker than those of India. Both the United States
and the United Kingdom supplied arms to Pakistan
in these years.
<br>
<br>
After Pakistani troops invaded Kashmir, India
moved quickly to internationalize the regional
dispute. It asked the United Nations to reprise its
role in the First India-Pakistan War and end the
current conflict. The Security Council passed
Resolution 211 on September 20 calling for an end
to the fighting and negotiations on the settlement
of the Kashmir problem, and the United States and
the United Kingdom supported the UN decision
by cutting off arms supplies to both belligerents.
This ban affected both belligerents, but Pakistan
felt the effects more keenly since it had a much
weaker military in comparison to India. The UN
resolution and the halting of arms sales had an
immediate impact. India accepted the ceasefire on
September 21 and Pakistan on September 22.
The ceasefire alone did not resolve the status of
Kashmir, and both sides accepted the Soviet Union
as a third-party mediator. Negotiations in Tashkent
concluded in January 1966, with both sides giving
up territorial claims, withdrawing their armies from
the disputed territory. Nevertheless, although the
Tashkent agreement achieved its short-term aims,
conflict in South Asia would reignite a few years
later.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN POLICY</i></strong></div>

Shastri continued Nehru's policy of non-alignment
but also built closer relations with the Soviet Union.
In the aftermath of the Sino-Indian War of 1962 and
the formation of military ties between the Chinese
People's Republic and Pakistan, Shastri's government
decided to expand the defence budget of India's
armed forces.
<br>
<br>
In 1964, Shastri signed an accord with the Sri
Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike
regarding the status of Indian Tamils in the then
Ceylon. This agreement is also known as the SrimavoShastri Pact or the Bandaranaike-Shastri pact.
Under the terms of this agreement, 600,000 Indian
Tamils were to be repatriated, while 375,000 were to
be granted Sri Lankan citizenship. This settlement
was to be done by 31 October, 1981. However, after
Shastri's death, by 1981, India had taken only 300,000
Tamils as repatriates, while Sri Lanka had granted
citizenship to only 185,000 citizens (plus another
62,000 born after 1964). Later, India declined to
consider any further applications for citizenship,
stating that the 1964 agreement had lapsed.
In December 1965, Lal Bahadur Shastri made an
official visit with his Family to Rangoon, Burma and
re-established a cordial relation with the country’s
Military government of General Ne Win. India’s
relationship with Burma stained after the 1962
Military coup followed by Lakhs of Indian Family
most of them are Tamils and Bengalis repatriate to
India from 1964.
The Central Government in New Delhi monitored
the overall process of repatriation and arranged for
identification and then transportation of the Indian
returnees from Burma back into India, it fell under
the responsibilities of local governments to provide
adequate facilities to shelter the repatriates upon.
