<h3>Indira Gandhi Tenure And Emergency 1969-1984</h3>

After the death of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur
Shastri in 1966 Gulzarilal Nanda once again
became interim Prime Minister for thirteen days.
On Shastri’s sudden death in January 1966,
Gandhi became leader of the Congress Party—and
thus also prime minister—in a compromise between
the right and left wings of the party. Her leadership,
however, came under continual challenge from the
right wing of the party, led by a former minister of
finance, Morarji Desai. Indira Gandhi (November
19, 1917, Allahabad, India—died October 31,
1984, New Delhi) served as prime minister
of India for three consecutive terms (1966–77) and
a fourth term from 1980 until she was assassinated
in 1984.
<br>
<br>
In 1967, the Congress Party won a reduced
majority in the 1967 elections owing to widespread
disenchantment over rising prices of commodities,
unemployment, economic stagnation and a food
crisis. Indira Gandhi had started on a rocky note
after agreeing to a devaluation of the Indian rupee,
which created much hardship for Indian businesses
and consumers, and the import of wheat from the
United States fell through due to political disputes.
Morarji Desai entered Gandhi's government as
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, and
with senior Congress politicians attempted to
constrain Gandhi's authority. But following the
counsel of her political advisor, P.N. Haksar, Gandhi
resuscitated her popular appeal by a major shift
towards socialist policies. She successfully ended
the privy purse guarantee for former Indian royalty,
and waged a major offensive against party
hierarchy over the nationalisation of India's banks.
Although resisted by Desai and India's business
community, the policy was popular with the
masses. When Congress politicians attempted to
oust Gandhi by suspending her Congress
membership, Gandhi was empowered with a large
exodus of Members of Parliament to her own
Congress (R). The bastion of the Indian freedom
struggle, the Indian National Congress had split in
1969. Gandhi continued to govern with a slim
majority.
<br>
<br>
In 1971, Indira Gandhi and her Congress (R)
were returned to power with a massively increased
majority. The nationalisation of banks was carried
out, and many other socialist economic and
industrial policies enacted. India intervened in
Bangladesh Liberation War-a civil war taking place
in Pakistan's Bengali half, after millions of refugees
had fled the persecution of the Pakistani army. The
clash resulted in the independence of East Pakistan,
which became known as Bangladesh, and Prime
Minister Indira Gandhi's elevation to immense
popularity. Relations with the United States grew
strained, and India signed a 20-year treaty of
friendship with the Soviet Union - breaking
explicitly for the first time from non-alignment. In
1974, India tested its first nuclear weapon in the
desert of Rajasthan. Meanwhile, in the Indian
protectorate of Sikkim, a referendum was held that
resulted in a vote to formally join India and depose
the Chogyal. On 26 April, 1975, Sikkim formally
became India's 22nd state.
<br>
<br>
In 1974, the Allahabad High Court found Indira
Gandhi guilty of misusing government machinery
for election purposes. Opposition parties conducted
nationwide strikes and protests demanding her
immediate resignation. Various political parties
united under Jaya Prakash Narayan to resist what
he termed Mrs. Gandhi's dictatorship. Leading
strikes across India that paralysed its economy and
administration, Narayan even called for the Army
to oust Mrs. Gandhi. In 1975, Mrs. Gandhi advised
President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed to declare a state
of emergency under the Constitution, which
allowed the Central government to assume
sweeping powers to defend law and order in the
nation. Explaining the breakdown of law and order
and threat to national security as her primary
reasons, Mrs. Gandhi suspended many civil
liberties and postponed elections at national and
state levels. Non-Congress governments in Indian
states were dismissed, and nearly 1,000 opposition
political leaders and activists were imprisoned and
programme of compulsory birth control introduced. Strikes and public protests were outlawed
in all forms.
<br>
<br>
India's economy benefited from an end to
paralysing strikes and political disorder. India
announced a 20-point programme which enhanced
agricultural and industrial production, increasing
national growth, productivity and job growth. But
many organs of government and many Congress
politicians were accused of corruption and
authoritarian conduct. Police officers were accused
of arresting and torturing innocent people. Indira's
son and political advisor, Sanjay Gandhi was
accused of committing gross excesses - Sanjay was
blamed for the Health Ministry carrying out forced
vasectomies of men and sterilisation of women as
a part of the initiative to control population growth,
and for the demolition of slums in Delhi.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JANATA PARTY</i></strong></div>

Gandhi's Congress Party called for general
elections in 1977, only to suffer a humiliating
electoral defeat at the hands of the Janata Party,
an amalgamation of opposition parties. Morarji
Desai became the first non-Congress Prime Minister
of India. The Desai administration established
tribunals to investigate Emergency-era abuses, and
Indira and Sanjay Gandhi were arrested after a
report from the Shah Commission.
But in 1979, the coalition crumbled and Charan
Singh formed an interim government. The Janata
party had become intensely unpopular due to its
internecine warfare, and the fact that it offered no
leadership on solving India's serious economic and
social problems.
<br>
<br>
Indira Gandhi and her Congress party splinter
group, Congress (Indira) party were swept back
into power with a large majority in January 1980.
But the rise of an insurgency in Punjab would
jeopardize India's security. In Assam, there were
many incidents of communal violence between
native villagers and refugees from Bangladesh, as
well as settlers from other parts of India. When
Indian forces undertaking Operation Blue Star,
raided the hideout of self-rule pressing Khalistan
militants in the Golden Temple - Sikhs' most holy
shrine - in Amritsar, the inadvertent deaths of
civilians and damage to the temple building
inflamed tensions in the Sikh community across
India. The Government used intensive police
operations to crush militant operations, but it
resulted in many claims of abuse of civil liberties.
Northeast India was paralyzed owing to the ULFA's
clash with Government forces.
On 31 October, 1984, the Prime Minister's own
Sikh bodyguards assassinated her, and 1984 AntiSikh Riots erupted in Delhi and parts of Punjab.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC POLICY</i></strong></div>

Gandhi presided over three Five-Year plans as
Prime Minister. All but one of them succeeding in
meeting the targeted growth. There is considerable
debate regarding whether Gandhi was a socialist
on principle or out of political expediency. Regardless of the debate over her ideology or lack of
thereof, Gandhi remains a left-wing icon. She has
been described as the "arguably the greatest mass
leader of the last century. Her campaign slogan,
‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty), has become the
iconic motto of the Indian National Congress.
Due to miserable failure of the Third Plan the
government was forced to declare "plan holidays"
(from 1966–67, 1967–68, and 1968–69). Three
annual plans were drawn during this intervening
period. During 1966–67 there was again the
problem of drought. Equal priority was given to
agriculture, its allied activities, and industrial sector.
The main reasons for plan holidays were the war,
lack of resources, and increase in inflation.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Green Revolution and the Fourth Five Year
Plan (1969-1974)</i></strong></div>    
        
At this time Indira Gandhi was the Prime
Minister. Fiscal problems associated with the war
with Pakistan in 1965, along with a droughtinduced food crisis that spawned famines, had
plunged India into the sharpest recession since
independence. To deal with India's food problems,
Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of
inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated
by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru. The Green
Revolution in India subsequently culminated under
her government in the 1970s and transformed the
country from a nation heavily reliant on imported
grains and prone to famine to being largely able to
feed itself, and become successful in achieving its
goal of food security. The Indira Gandhi
government nationalised 14 major Indian banks
and the Green Revolution in India advanced
agriculture. In addition, the situation in East
Pakistan (now Bangladesh) was becoming dire as
the Indo-Pakistan War of 1971 and Bangladesh
Liberation War took funds earmarked for industrial
development. India also performed the Smiling
Buddha underground nuclear test in 1974. The
target growth rate was 5.6%, but the actual growth
rate was 3.3%.</li>
        <li><b>Fifth Five Year Plan (1974-1979)</b>
The Fifth Five-Year Plan laid stress
on employment, poverty alleviation (Garibi Hatao),
and justice. The plan also focused on self-reliance in
agricultural production and defence. The measures
of the emergency regime was able to halt the
economic trouble of the early to mid-1970s, which
had been marred by harvest failures, fiscal
contraction, and the breakdown of the Bretton
Woods system of fixed exchanged rate; the resulting
turbulence in the foreign exchange markets being
further accentuated by the oil shock of 1973. The
government was even able to exceed the targeted
growth figure with an annual growth rate of
5.0–5.2% over the five-year period of the plan
(1974–79). The economy grew at the rate of 9% in
1975–76 alone, and the Fifth Plan, became the first
plan during which the per capita income of the
economy grew by over 5%. In 1978 the newly
elected Morarji Desai government rejected the plan.
The Electricity Supply Act was amended in 1975,
which enabled the central government to enter into
power generation and transmission.
The Indian national highway system was
introduced and many roads were widened to
accommodate the increasing traffic. Tourism also
expanded. It was followed from 1974 to 1979. The
target growth rate was 4.4% and the actual growth
rate was 5.0%.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rolling Plan (1978-80)</i></strong></div>    
        
The Janata Party government rejected the Fifth
Five–Year Plan and introduced a new Sixth FiveYear Plan (1978–1983). This plan was again
rejected by the Indian National Congress government in 1980 and a new Sixth Plan was made. The
earlier one was subsequently referred to as a rolling
plan.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sixth Five-Year Plan (1980-85)</i></strong></div>    
        
Although Gandhi continued professing socialist
beliefs, the Sixth Five–Year Plan marked the
beginning of economic liberalization. Populist
programs and policies were replaced by pragmatism. Price controls were eliminated and ration
shops were closed. This led to an increase in food
prices and an increase in the cost of living. Family
planning was also expanded in order to prevent
overpopulation. In contrast to China's strict and
binding one-child policy, Indian policy did not rely
on the threat of force. More prosperous areas of
India adopted family planning more rapidly than
less prosperous areas, which continued to have a
high birth rate. There was an emphasis on
tightening public expenditures, greater efficiency
of the State Owned Enterprises (SOE), and in
stimulating the private sector through deregulation
and liberation of the capital market. The
government subsequently launched Operation
Forward in 1982, the first cautious attempt at
reform. The Sixth Five-Year Plan was a great
success to the Indian economy. The target growth
rate was 5.2% and the actual growth rate was
5.4%.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DOMESTIC POLICY</i></strong></div>


<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nationalisation</i></strong></div>    
        
Despite the provisions, control and regulations
of Reserve Bank of India, most banks in India had
continued to be owned and operated by private
persons. In 1969, Gandhi moved to nationalise
fourteen major commercial banks. After the
nationalisation of banks, the branches of the public
sector banks in India rose to approximate 800 per
cent in deposits, and advances took a huge jump
by 11,000 per cent. Nationalisation also resulted in
a significant growth in the geographical coverage
of banks; the number of bank branches rose from
8,200 to over 62,000, most of which were opened
in the unbanked, rural areas. The nationalisation
drive not only helped to increase household savings,
but it also provided considerable investments in
the informal sector, in small and medium-sized
enterprises, and in agriculture, and contributed
significantly to regional development and to the
expansion of India’s industrial and agricultural
base. Having been re-elected in 1971 on a
nationalisation platform, Gandhi proceeded to
nationalise the coal, steel, copper, refining, cotton
textiles, and insurance industries. Most of these
nationalisations were made to protect employment
and the interest of the organized labour. The
remaining private sector industries were placed
under strict regulatory control. In 1973, Indira
Gandhi nationalised oil companies.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Administration</i></strong></div>    
        
In 1966, Punjab was reorganized on linguistic
lines. The Hindi-speaking southern half of Punjab
became a separate state, Haryana, while the Pahari
speaking hilly areas in the northeast were joined
to Himachal Pradesh. In doing so, the intension was
to ward off the growing political conflict between
Hindu and Sikh groups in the region. However, a
contentious issue that was considered unresolved
by the Akali's was the status of Chandigarh, a
prosperous city on the Punjab-Haryana border,
which was a union territory to be shared as a
capital by both the states.
<br>
<br>
Victory over Pakistan in 1971 consolidated
Indian power in Kashmir. Gandhi indicated that
she would make no major concessions on Kashmir.
The most prominent of the Kashmiri separatists,
Sheikh Abdullah, had to recognize India's control
over Kashmir in light of the new order in South
Asia. The situation was normalized in the years
following the war after Abdullah agreed to an
accord with Gandhi, by giving up the demand for
a plebiscite in return for a special autonomous
status for Kashmir. In 1975, the state of Jammu
and Kashmir was decleared as a constituent unit
of India. The Kashmir conflict remained largely
peaceful under Gandhi's premiership.
<br>
<br>
In 1972, Meghalaya, Manipur and Tripura were
granted statehood, while the North-East Frontier
Agency was declared a union territory and
renamed Arunachal Pradesh. The transition to
statehood for these territories was successfully
overseen by her administration. This was followed
by the annexation of Sikkim in 1975.
The principle of equal pay for equal work for
both men and women was enshrined in the
Indian Constitution under the Gandhi administration. Gandhi questioned the continued
existence of a privy purse for Indian monarchs.
She argued the case for abolition based on equal
rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the
government's revenue deficit. The privy purse
was abolished by the 26th Amendment to the
Constitution of India.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Language policy</i></strong></div>    
        
Under the Indian Constitution of 1950, Hindi
was to have become the official national language
by 1965. This was not acceptable to many nonHindi speaking states, who wanted the continued
use of English in government. In 1967, Gandhi
made a constitutional amendment that guaranteed
the de facto use of both Hindi and English as official
languages. This established the official government
policy of bilingualism in India and satisfied the nonHindi speaking Indian states. Gandhi thus put
herself forward as a leader with a pan-Indian
vision.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>National security</i></strong></div>    
        
In the late 1960s and 1970s, Gandhi had the
Indian army crush militant Communist uprisings in
the Indian state of West Bengal. The communist
insurgency in India was completely suppressed
during the state of emergency.
Gandhi considered the north-eastern regions
important, because of its strategic situation. In 1966,
the Mizo uprising took place against the government of India and overran almost the whole of
the Mizoram region. Gandhi ordered the Indian
army to launch massive retaliatory strikes in
response. The rebellion was suppressed with
the Indian Air Force even carrying out airstrikes
in Aizawl; this remains the only instance of India
carrying out an airstrike in its own civilian
territory. The defeat of Pakistan in 1971 and the
secession of East Pakistan as pro-India Bangladesh
led to the collapse of the Mizo separatist movement.
In 1972, after the less extremist Mizo leaders came
to the negotiating table, Gandhi upgraded Mizoram
to the status of a union territory. A small-scale
insurgency by some militants continued into the
late 1970s but was successfully dealt with by the
government. The Mizo conflict was definitively
resolved during the administration of Indira's
son Rajiv Gandhi. Today, Mizoram is considered as
one of the most peaceful states in the north-east.
Responding to the insurgency in Nagaland, Gandhi
"unleashed a powerful military offensive" in the
1970s. Finally, a massive crackdown on the
insurgents took place during the state of
emergency ordered by Gandhi. The insurgents soon
agreed to surrender and signed the Shillong
Accord in 1975. While the agreement was
considered a victory for the Indian government and
ended large-scale conflicts, there has since been
spurts of violence by rebel holdouts and ethnic
conflict amongst the tribes.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nuclear Programme of India</i></strong></div>     
        
Gandhi contributed and further carried out the
vision of Jawarharalal Nehru, former Premier of
India to develop the program. Gandhi authorised
the development of nuclear weapons in 1967, in
response to the Test No.6 by People's Republic of
China. Gandhi saw this test as Chinese nuclear
intimidation, therefore, Gandhi promoted the views
of Nehru to establish India's stability and security
interests as independent from those of the nuclear
superpowers.
<br>
<br>
The program became fully mature in 1974, when
Dr. Raja Ramanna reported to Gandhi that India
had the ability to test its first nuclear weapon In
1974, India successfully conducted an underground
nuclear test, unofficially code named as "Smiling
Buddha", near the desert village of Pokhran in
Rajasthan.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN POLICY DURING SHASTRI
AND INDIRA GANDHI TENURE</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>“Modified Structuralism”:</b> the post-Nehru Era
The military defeat in 1962 marked nothing
short of a watershed in the structure and conduct
of India’s foreign and security policies. In the
immediate aftermath of this military debacle, Nehru
overcame his staunch objections to defense
spending. In his final days, he oversaw a drastic
re-appraisal of India’s security policies and
practices. Most importantly, India embarked on a
substantial program of military modernization. It
committed itself to the creation of a million man
army with ten new mountain divisions equipped
and trained for high altitude warfare, a 45 squadron
airforce with supersonic aircraft and a modest
program of naval expansion. However, even after
Nehru’s demise in 1964, his successors still could
not formally abandon the stated adherence to a
policy of non-alignment. Consequently, the rhetoric
of non-alignment remained a staple of Indian
foreign policy. India’s foreign policy behavior,
however, increasingly assumed a more Realist
orientation.
<br>
<br>
Once again, global, regional and personal factors
contributed to the major policy shift. Despite a
fleeting moment of military cooperation with India
in the aftermath of the 1962 war, the United States
disengaged itself from South Asia after the second
Indo-Pakistani conflict in 1965 as it became
increasingly preoccupied with the prosecution of the
Vietnam war. Barring a brief and unhappy interlude
in 1966 when the Johnson administration chose to
exert considerable economic pressure on India to
temper its criticism of the Vietnam war, to reform
its agricultural policies and to open up its domestic
economy to foreign investment, the United States,
for all practical purposes, lost interest in India.
Sensing an opportunity to expand their
influence in the subcontinent, the Soviets brokered
a peace agreement between India and Pakistan in
the Central Asian city of Tashkent in 1966. With
this American disengagement from the subcontinent, Pakistan sought to expand the scope of
its security cooperation with China to balance
Indian power contributing to a growing security
nexus between India’s two major adversaries.
At a regional level, India’s misgivings about its
security increased in the aftermath of the first
Chinese nuclear test at Lop Nor in 1964. The
political fallout from these tests was considerable.
Some within India’s parliament called for an
abandonment of non-alignment and even urged
that India acquire an independent nuclear weapons
option. After considerable debate, the ruling
Congress party and the new Prime Minister, Lal
Bahadur Shastri, reaffirmed the country’s public
commitment to non-alignment and eschewed any
immediate plans to acquire nuclear weapons.
However, in 1966, Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi, Shastri’s successor, decided to seek a
nuclear guarantee from the great powers. This
effort, proved to be quite fruitless. In the aftermath
of this failure, Prime Minister Gandhi authorized
India’s Subterranean Nuclear Explosions Project
(SNEP) which culminated in India’s first nuclear
test of May 1974. Under Indira Gandhi, India’s
foreign policy sought to sustain two competing
visions of world order. On the one hand, India still
supported the cause of decolonization and
continued to lead the charge on behalf of the
weaker states in the international system. For
example, it remained a staunch opponent of the
apartheid regime in South Africa, it was an
unyielding supporter of the Palestinian cause and
it opposed the Portuguese presence in Angola and
Mozambique.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, it also came to accept the
importance of defense preparedness and
increasingly overcame its reservations about the use
of force in international politics. Not surprisingly,
when faced with several million refugees from East
Pakistan as a consequence of the outbreak of a
civil war, the country quickly forged a careful
politico-diplomatic strategy to breakup Pakistan.
Part of this strategy involved the acquisition of a
tacit security guarantee from the Soviet Union to
counter possible Chinese malfeasance. Accordingly,
despite India’s professed commitment to
non-alignment it signed a twenty-year pact of
“peace, friendship and cooperation” with the Soviet
Union in August 1971. With its northern flanks
thereby protected, India had a free hand to
intervene in East Pakistan. Fortunately, Pakistan’s
attack on its northern air bases in early December
gave it the casus belli to launch an attack on the
eastern front. Within two weeks, the Indian army
along with an indigenous Bengali rebel movement,
the “mukti bahini” (literally “liberation force”)
militarily prevailed against the demoralized
Pakistani forces.
<br>
<br>
In the aftermath of the 1971 war, the
concomitant break-up of Pakistan and the creation
of Bangladesh, Indian emerged as the undisputed
dominant power within the subcontinent. Despite
its new found status, the country was unable to
transcend the region. Several factors account for
this failure to emerge as a power of any
consequence in the global order. Most importantly,
thanks to its pursuit of a dubious strategy of stateled industrialization India’s economic growth
remained anemic. Simultaneously, the country’s
deep-seated export pessimism led it to shy away
from integrating itself into the global economy. The
failure to develop ties with the global economy
contributed to a paucity of foreign investment,
important technological lags, a lack of innovation
and the stifling of entrepreneurship. In turn, these
forces contributed to what the eminent Indian
economist Raj Krishna mordantly referred to as
the “Hindu rate of growth”.
<br>
<br>
India’s political choices at systemic and national
levels also did very little to enhance it global stature.
At a global level, in the wake of the first oil crisis
of 1973, India chose to spearhead the Group of 77,
a set of developing nations seeking to fundamentally
alter the global economic order. Ironically, while it
was a leader of this coalition it benefited little from
the global spike in oil prices and failed to obtain
any meaningful concessions as a resource-poor
developing nation from the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
Indeed the country’s economic weakness
effectively prevented it from carrying through a
viable nuclear weapons program even after it
managed to successfully test a nuclear weapon in
May 1974. Faced with widespread global diplomatic
disapprobation and significant economic and
technological sanctions, India’s policymakers chose
not carry out any further tests.
<br>
<br>
Throughout much of the decade of the 1970s
thanks to its poor record of economic growth and
its diplomatic limitations India became a marginal
player in the global order. Its influence remained
confined to the South Asian region. Its insignificance was again underscored when the Soviets
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The
United States paid scant attention to Indian
sensibilities and concerns when it chose to forge a
renewed strategic relationship with Pakistan almost
immediately after the Soviet invasion. General
Zia-ul-Haq even rebuffed India’s efforts at
reassuring Pakistan in the aftermath of the invasion.
In its efforts to oust the Soviets from
Afghanistan the United States came to rely heavily
on Pakistan. General Zia-ul-Haq, the military
dictator, quite astutely exacted a significant
economic and military price for such cooperation.
During his watch, the United States provided two
packages of foreign assistance the first for five years
of $3.2 billion and the second for six years of $4.02
billion. In an effort to maintain its military
superiority over Pakistan, India entered into a
tighter military cooperation relationship with the
Soviet Union. This military relationship, however,
exacted a significant diplomatic cost. India was
forced to tacitly acquiesce in the Soviet occupation
of Afghanistan. For the remainder of the decade,
barring some limited efforts on the part of the
Reagan administration to improve relations with
India as part of a strategy to reduce the country’s
dependence on the Soviet Union, India remained
of little consequence to the great powers.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAJOR EVENTS</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indo–Pakistan War (1971) and Bangladesh</i></strong></div>
            
The Indo–Pakistani conflict was sparked by the
Bangladesh Liberation war, a conflict between the
traditionally dominant West Pakistanis and the
majority East Pakistanis.[14] The Bangladesh
Liberation war ignited after the 1970 Pakistani
election, in which the East Pakistani Awami
League won 167 of 169 seats in East Pakistan and
secured a simple majority in the 313-seat lower
house of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament of Pakistan).
Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman
presented the Six Points to the President of Pakistan
and claimed the right to form the government. After
the leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto, refused to yield the premiership of Pakistan
to Mujibur, President Yahya Khan called the
military, dominated by West Pakistanis, to suppress
dissent in East Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
Mass arrests of dissidents began, and attempts
were made to disarm East Pakistani soldiers and
police. After several days of strikes and non-cooperation movements, the Pakistani military cracked
down on Dhaka on the night of 25 March, 1971.
The Awami League was banished, and many
members fled into exile in India. Mujib was arrested
on the night of 25–26 March, 1971 at about 1:30 am
(as per Radio Pakistan's news on 29 March, 1971)
and taken to West Pakistan. The next action carried
out was Operation Searchlight, an attempt to kill
the intellectual elite of the east.[31]
On 26 March, 1971, Ziaur Rahman, a major in
the Pakistani army, declared the independence of
Bangladesh. In April, exiled Awami League leaders
formed a government-in exile in Baidyanathtala
of Meherpur. The East Pakistan Rifles, a paramilitary force, defected to the rebellion. Bangladesh
Force namely Mukti Bahini consisting of Niyomito
Bahini (Regular Force) and Gono Bahini (Guerilla
Force).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>India’s Involvement</i></strong></div>

The Pakistan army conducted a widespread
genocide against the Bengali population of East
Pakistan, aimed in particular at the minority Hindu
population, leading to approximately 10 million
people fleeing East Pakistan and taking refuge in
the neighbouring Indian states. The East PakistanIndia border was opened to allow refugees safe
shelter in India. The governments of West Bengal,
Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya and Tripura established
 refugee camps along the border. The resulting flood
of impoverished East Pakistani refugees placed an
intolerable strain on India's already overburdened
economy.
<br>
<br>
The Indian government repeatedly appealed to
the international community, but failing to elicit any
response, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on 27
March, 1971 expressed full support of her
government for the independence struggle of the
people of East Pakistan. The Indian leadership
under Prime Minister Gandhi quickly decided that
it was more effective to end the genocide by taking
armed action against Pakistan than to simply give
refuge to those who made it across to refugee
camps. Exiled East Pakistan army officers and
members of the Indian Intelligence immediately
started using these camps for recruitment and
training of Mukti Bahini guerrillas.
The mood in West Pakistan had also turned
increasingly jingoistic and militaristic against East
Pakistan and India. By the end of September, an
organised propaganda campaign, possibly
orchestrated by elements within the Government
of Pakistan, resulted in stickers proclaiming Crush
India becoming a standard feature on the rear
windows of vehicles in Rawalpindi, Islamabad and
Lahore and soon spread to the rest of West
Pakistan. By October, other stickers proclaimed
Hang the Traitor in an apparent reference to Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman.
<br>

By November, war seemed inevitable. Throughout November, thousands of people led by West
Pakistani politicians marched in Lahore and across
West Pakistan, calling for Pakistan to Crush
India. India responded by starting a massive
buildup of Indian forces on the border with East
Pakistan. The Indian military waited until
December, when the drier ground would make for
easier operations and Himalayan passes would be
closed by snow, preventing any Chinese intervention. On 23 November, Yahya Khan declared a
state of emergency in all of Pakistan and told his
people to prepare for war.
On the evening of 3 December, Sunday, at
about 5:40 pm, the Pakistani Air Force (PAF)
launched a pre-emptive strike on eleven airfields in
north-western India.
In an address to the nation on radio that same
evening, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi held that
the air strikes were a declaration of war against
India and the Indian Air Force responded with
initial air strikes that very night. These air strikes
were expanded to massive retaliatory air strikes
the next morning and thereafter which followed
interceptions by Pakistanis anticipating this action.
This marked the official start of the IndoPakistani War of 1971. Prime Minister Indira
Gandhi ordered the immediate mobilisation of
troops and launched a full-scale invasion. This
involved Indian forces in a massive coordinated air,
sea, and land assault. Indian Air Force started flying
sorties against Pakistan from midnight. The main
Indian objective on the western front was to prevent
Pakistan from entering Indian soil. There was no
Indian intention of conducting any major offensive
into West Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
 India's grip on what had been East Pakistan
tightened. Hostilities officially ended on 17
December, after the fall of Dacca on 15 December.
India claimed large gains of territory in West
Pakistan (although pre-war boundaries were

recognised after the war), and the independence
of Pakistan's East wing as Bangladesh was
confirmed.
<br>
<br>
Surrender of Pakistani forces in East Pakistan
Faced with insurmountable losses, the Pakistani
military capitulated in less than a fortnight. On 16
December, the Pakistani forces stationed in
East Pakistan surrendered. The Instrument of
Surrender of Pakistani forces stationed in East
Pakistan was signed at Ramna Race Course
in Dhaka at 16.31 IST on 16 December, 1971,
by Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora, General
Officer Commanding-in-chief of Eastern Command
of the Indian Army and Lieutenant General
A. A. K. Niazi, Commander of Pakistani forces in
East Pakistan. As Aurora accepted the surrender,
the surrounding crowds on the race course began
shouting anti-Niazi and anti-Pakistan slogans.
India took approximately 90,000 prisoners of
war, including Pakistani soldiers and their East
Pakistani civilian supporters. With the end of the
war Bangladesh became an independent nation,
the world's fourth most populous Muslim
state. Mujibur Rahman was released from a West
Pakistani prison, returning to Dhaka on 10 January,
1972 and becoming the first President of
Bangladesh and later its Prime Minister.
<br>
<br>
United States and Soviet Union
The Soviet Union sympathised with the
Bangladeshis, and supported the Indian Army and
Mukti Bahini during the war, recognising that the
independence of Bangladesh would weaken the
position of its rivals—the United States and China.
The USSR gave assurances to India that if a
confrontation with the United States or China
developed, it would take counter-measures. This
assurance was enshrined in the Indo-Soviet
friendship treaty signed in August 1971.
The United States supported Pakistan both
politically and materially. President Richard
Nixon and his Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
feared Soviet expansion into South and Southeast
Asia. Pakistan was a close ally of the People's
Republic of China, with whom Nixon had been
negotiating a reapprochment and where he
intended to visit in February 1972. Nixon feared
that an Indian invasion of West Pakistan would
mean total Soviet domination of the region, and
that it would seriously undermine the global
position of the United States and the regional
position of America's new tacit ally, China. The
Nixon administration also ignored reports it received
of the "genocidal" activities of the Pakistani Army
in East Pakistan.Then-US ambassador to the United
Nations George H.W. Bush—later 41st President of
the United States—introduced a resolution in the
UN Security Council calling for a ceasefire and the
withdrawal of armed forces by India and Pakistan.
It was vetoed by the Soviet Union. The following
days witnessed a great pressure on the Soviets from
the Nixon-Kissinger duo to get India to withdraw,
but to no avail.
<br>
<br>
When Pakistan's defeat in the eastern sector
seemed certain, Nixon deployed Task Force 74 led
by the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise into the Bay
of Bengal. The Enterprise and its escort ships arrived
on station on 11 December, 1971. On 6 and
13 December, the Soviet Navy dispatched two
groups of cruisers and destroyers and a submarine
armed with nuclear missiles from Vladivostok; they
trailed US Task Force 74 into the Indian Ocean
from 18 December, 1971 until 7 January, 1972. The
Soviets also had a nuclear submarine to help ward
off the threat posed by USS Enterprise taskforce in
the Indian Ocean.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>China</i></strong></div>
            
As a long-standing ally of Pakistan, the People's
Republic of China reacted with alarm to the
evolving situation in East Pakistan and the prospect
of India invading West Pakistan and Pakistanicontrolled Kashmir. Believing that just such an
Indian attack was imminent, Nixon encouraged
China to mobilise its armed forces along its border
with India to discourage it. The Chinese did not,
however, respond to this encouragement, because
unlike the 1962 Sino-Indian War when India was
caught entirely unaware, this time the Indian Army
was prepared and had deployed eight mountain
divisions to the Sino-Indian border to guard against
such an eventuality. China instead threw its weight
behind demands for an immediate ceasefire.
When Bangladesh applied for membership to
the United Nations in 1972, China vetoed their
application because two United Nations resolutions
regarding the repatriation of Pakistani prisoners of
war and civilians had not yet been implemented.
China was also among the last countries to
recognise independent Bangladesh, refusing to do
so until 31 August, 1975.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Simla Agreement</i></strong></div>
            
In 1972, the Simla Agreement was signed
between India and Pakistan, the treaty ensured that
Pakistan recognised the independence of
Bangladesh in exchange for the return of the
Pakistani POWs. India treated all the POWs in strict
accordance with the Geneva Convention, rule
1925. It released more than 90,000 Pakistani PoWs
in five months.
<br>
<br>
The accord also gave back more than 13,000 km²
of land that Indian troops had seized in West
Pakistan during the war, though India retained a
few strategic areas. But some in India felt that the
treaty had been too lenient to Bhutto, who had
pleaded for leniency, arguing that the fragile
democracy in Pakistan would crumble if the accord
was perceived as being overly harsh by Pakistanis
and that he would be accused of losing Kashmir in
addition to the loss of East Pakistan.</li>
        <li> 
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>State of Emergency (1975–1977)</i></strong></div>
        
The Government cited threats to national
security, as a war with Pakistan had recently been
concluded. Due to the war and additional
challenges of drought and the 1973 oil crisis, the
economy was in bad shape. The Government
claimed that the strikes and protests had paralysed
the government and hurt the economy of the
country greatly. Her Cabinet and government then
recommended that President Fakhruddin Ali
Ahmed declare a state of emergency because of the
disorder and lawlessness following the Allahabad
High Court decision. Accordingly, Ahmed declared
a State of Emergency caused by internal disorder,
based on the provisions of Article 352(1) of the
Constitution, on 25 June, 1975.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Within a few months, President's Rule was
imposed on the two opposition party ruled states
of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu thereby bringing the
entire country under direct Central rule or by
governments led by the ruling Congress party.
Police were granted powers to impose curfews and
indefinitely detain citizens and all publications
were subjected to substantial censorship by
the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.
Finally, impending legislative assembly elections
were indefinitely postponed, with all oppositioncontrolled state governments being removed by
virtue of the constitutional provision allowing
for a dismissal of a state government on
recommendation of the state's governor.

Elections for the Parliament and state
governments were postponed. Gandhi and her
parliamentary majorities could rewrite the nation's
laws, since her Congress party had the required
mandate to do so - a two-thirds majority in the
Parliament. And when she felt the existing laws
were 'too slow', she got the President to issue
'Ordinances' - a law making power in times of
urgency, invoked sparingly - completely bypassing
the Parliament, allowing her to rule by decree. Also,
she had little trouble amending the Constitution
that exonerated her from any culpability in her
election-fraud case, imposing President's Rule in
Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, where anti-Indira parties
ruled (state legislatures were thereby dissolved and
suspended indefinitely), and jailing thousands of
opponents. The 42nd Amendment, which brought
about extensive changes to the letter and spirit of
the Constitution, is one of the lasting legacies of
the Emergency.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

A fallout of the Emergency era was - the
Supreme Court laid down that, although the
Constitution is amenable to amendments (as abused
by Indira Gandhi), changes that tinker with its basic
structure cannot be made by the Parliament.
(Kesavananda Bharti case).
<br>
<br>
Criticism and accusations of the Emergency-era
may be grouped as:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Detention of people by police without
charge or notification of families.</li>
        <li>Abuse and torture of detainees and political
prisoners.</li>
        <li>Use of public and private media institutions,
like the national television network
Doordarshan, for government propaganda.</li>
        <li>Forced sterilisation.</li>
        <li>Destruction of the slum and low-income
housing in the Turkmen Gate and Jama
Masjid area of old Delhi.</li>
        <li>Large-scale and illegal enactment of laws
(including modifications to the Constitution).
The Emergency years were the biggest challenge
to India's commitment to democracy, which proved
vulnerable to the manipulation of powerful leaders
and hegemonic Parliamentary majorities.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>OPERATION BLUE STAR</i></strong></div>

In the 1977 elections, a coalition led by the Sikhmajority Akali Dal came to power in the northern
Indian state of Punjab. In an effort to split the
Akali Dal and gain popular support among
the Sikhs, Indira Gandhi's Congress helped bring
the orthodox religious leader Jarnail Singh
Bhindranwale to prominence in Punjab politics.
Later, Bhindranwale's organization Damdami
Taksal became embroiled in violence with another
religious sect called the Sant Nirankari Mission, and
he was accused of instigating the murder of the
Congress leader Jagat Narain. After being arrested
in this matter, Bhindranwale disassociated himself
from Congress and joined hands with the Akali
Dal. In July 1982, he led the campaign for the
implemen-tation of the Anandpur Sahib Resolution,
which demanded greater autonomy for the Sikh-majority state. 
Meanwhile, a small section of the
Sikhs including some of Bhindranwale's followers,
turned to militancy in support of the Khalistan
movement, which aimed to create a separate
sovereign state for the Sikhs. In 1983, Bhindranwale
and his militant followers headquartered themselves
in the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine of the Sikhs,
and started accumulating weapons. After several
futile negotiations, Indira Gandhi ordered the
Indian army to enter the Golden temple in order to
subdue Bhindranwale and his followers. In the
resulting Operation Blue Star, the shrine was
damaged and many civilians were killed. The State
of Punjab was closed to international media, its
phone and communication lines shut. To this day
the events remain controversial with a disputed
number of victims; Sikhs seeing the attack as
unjustified and Bhindranwale being declared the
greatest Sikh martyr of the 21st century by Akal
Takht (Sikh Political Authority) in 2003.
