<h3>The Rajiv Gandhi Tenure And Era Of Coliation 1984-1991</h3>

The Congress party chose Rajiv Gandhi, Indira's
older son as the next Prime Minister. Rajiv had
been elected to Parliament only in 1982, and at 40,
was the youngest national political leader and
Prime Minister ever. But his youth and inexperience
was an asset in the eyes of citizens tired of the
inefficacy and corruption of career politicians, and
looking for newer policies and a fresh start to
resolve the country's long-standing problems. The
Parliament was dissolved, and Rajiv led the
Congress party to its largest majority in history
(over 415 seats out of 545 possible), reaping a
sympathy vote over his mother's assassination.
Rajiv Gandhi initiated a series of reforms -
the license raj was loosened, and government
restrictions on foreign currency, travel, foreign
investment and imports decreased considerably.
This allowed private businesses to use resources
and produce commercial goods without government bureaucracy interfering, and the influx of
foreign investment increased India's national
reserves. As Prime Minister, Rajiv broke from his
mother's precedent to improve relations with the
United States, which increased economic aid and
scientific co–operation. Rajiv's encouragement of
science and technology resulted in a major
expansion of the telecommunications industry,
India's space programme and gave birth to
the software industry and information technology
sector.
<br>
<br>
In December 1984, gas leaks out at Union
Carbide pesticides plant in the central Indian city
of Bhopal. Thousands were killed immediately,
many more subsequently died or were left disabled.
India in 1987 brokered an agreement between
the Government of Sri Lanka and agreed to deploy
troops for peacekeeping operation in Sri Lanka's
ethnic conflict lead by the LTTE. Rajiv sent Indian
troops to enforce the agreement and disarm
the Tamil rebels, but the Indian Peace Keeping
Force, as it was known, became entangled in
outbreaks of violence - ultimately ending up fighting
the Tamil rebels itself, and becoming a target of
attack from Sri Lankan nationalists. V.P. Singh
withdrew the IPKF in 1990, but thousands of Indian
soldiers had died. Rajiv's departure from Socialist
policies did not sit well with the masses, who did
not benefit from the innovations. Unemployment
was a serious problem, and India's burgeoning
population added ever-increasing needs for
diminishing resources.
<br>
<br>
Rajiv Gandhi's image as an honest politician
was shattered when the Bofors scandal broke,
revealing that senior government officials had taken
bribes over defence contracts by a Swedish guns
producer.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC POLICY</i></strong></div>

He increased government support for science
and technology and associated industries, and
reduced import quotas, taxes and tariffs on
technology-based industries, especially computers,
airlines, defence and telecommunications. In 1986,
he announced a National Policy on Education to
modernise and expand higher education programs
across India. He founded the Jawahar Navodaya
Vidyalaya System in 1986 which is a Central
government based institution that concentrates on
the upliftment of the rural section of the society
providing them free residential education from 6th
till 12 grade. His efforts created MTNL in 1986,
and his public call offices, better known as PCOs,
helped spread telephones in rural areas. He
introduced measures significantly reducing
the Licence Raj, in post-1990 period, allowing
businesses and individuals to purchase capital,
consumer goods and import without bureaucratic restrictions.
The Seventh Five-Year Plan marked the
comeback of the Congress Party to power. The plan
laid stress on improving the productivity level of
industries by upgrading of technology.
The main objectives of the Seventh Five-Year
Plan were to establish growth in areas of increasing
economic productivity, production of food grains,
and generating employment.
<br>
<br>
As an outcome of the Sixth Five-Year Plan, there
had been steady growth in agriculture, controls on
the rate of inflation, and favourable balance of
payments which had provided a strong base for
the Seventh Five-Year Plan to build on the need for
further economic growth. The Seventh Plan had
strived towards socialism and energy production
at large. The thrust areas of the Seventh Five-Year
Plan were: social justice, removal of oppression of
the weak, using modern technology, agricultural
development, anti-poverty programs, full supply of
food, clothing, and shelter, increasing productivity
of small- and large-scale farmers, and making India
an independent economy.
<br>
<br>
Based on a 15-year period of striving towards
steady growth, the Seventh Plan was focused on
achieving the prerequisites of self-sustaining growth
by the year 2000. The plan expected the labour
force to grow by 39 million people and employment
was expected to grow at the rate of 4% per year.
Under the Seventh Five-Year Plan, India strove
to bring about a self-sustained economy in the
country with valuable contributions from voluntary
agencies and the general populace. The target
growth rate was 5.0% and the actual growth rate
was 6.01%.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN POLICY</i></strong></div>

Rajiv Gandhi began leading in a direction
significantly different from his mother's socialism.
He improved bilateral relations with the United
States – long strained owing to Indira's socialism
and friendship with the USSR—and expanded
economic and scientific cooperation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SECURITY POLICY</i></strong></div>

Rajiv authorised an extensive police and army
campaign to contain terrorism in Punjab. A state
of martial law existed in the Punjab state, and civil
liberties, commerce and tourism were greatly
disrupted. There are many accusations of human
rights violations by police officials as well as by the
militants during this period. It is alleged that even
as the situation in Punjab came under control, the
Indian government was offering arms and training
to the LTTE rebels fighting the government of Sri
Lanka. The Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord was
signed by Rajiv Gandhi and the Sri Lankan
President J.R. Jayewardene, in Colombo on 29 July,
1987. The very next day, on 30 July, 1987, Rajiv
Gandhi was assaulted on the head with a rifle butt
by a young Sinhalese naval cadet while receiving
the honour guard.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JANATA DAL</i></strong></div>

General elections in 1989 gave Rajiv's Congress
a plurality, a far cry from the majority which
propelled him to power.
Power came instead to his former finance and
Defence minister, V.P. Singh of Janata Dal. Singh
had been moved from the Finance ministry to the
Defence ministry after he unearthed some scandals
which made the Congress leadership uncomfortable. Singh then unearthed the Bofors scandal,
and was sacked from the party and office. Becoming
a popular crusader for reform and clean
government, Singh led the Janata Dal coalition to
a majority. He was supported by BJP and the leftist
parties from outside. Becoming Prime Minister,
Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple
shrine, to heal the wounds of the past. He started
to implement the controversial Mandal commission report, to increase the quota in reservation
for low caste Hindus. The BJP protested these
implementations, and took its support back,
following which he resigned. Chandra Shekhar split
to form the Janata Dal (Socialist), supported by
Rajiv's Congress. This new government also
collapsed in a matter of months, when congress
withdrew its support.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ISSUES</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sikh Riots and Terrorism in Punjab</i></strong></div>    
        
Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh
members of her security guard. Earlier she had
rejected her security chief's suggestion that all Sikhs
be removed from her security staff. The
assassination of the popular prime minister led to
a wave of horror, fear, anger and communal
outrage among people all over the country,
especially among the poor. This anger took an ugly
and communal form in Delhi and some other parts
of North India, where anti-Sikh riots broke out as
soon as the news of the assassination spread. For
three days from the evening of 31 October, mobs
took over the streets of Delhi and made Sikhs targets
of violence. There was complete failure of the law
and order machinery in giving protection to Sikhs
and their property. The three-day violence in Delhi
resulted in the death of more than 2,500 Sikhs. The
slums and resettlement colonies of Delhi were the
main scenes of carnage.
<br>
<br>
Finally, in August 1985, Rajiv Gandhi and
Longowal signed the Punjab Accord. The
government conceded the major Akali demands. It
was agreed that Chandigarh would be transferred
to Punjab and a commission would determine
which Hindi-speaking terrorists would be
transferred from Punjab to Haryana. The river
water dispute was to be adjudicated by an
independent tribunal. On 20 August, Longowal
announced that the Akalis would participate in
the elections. He was assassinated by the terrorists
on same day. The Akalis secured an absolute
majority in the state assembly for the first time in
their history.
<br>
<br>
There was a resurgence in terrorists activities.
The militant groups regrouped taking advantage
of policies of the Barnala government where the
state government was riven with factionalism and
thus was unable to contain them. Soon, the central
government dismissed the Barnala ministry and
imposed President's Rule in Punjab in May 1987.
Despite this, terrorism in Punjab went on growing.
After 1985 terrorism begun to be openly funded
and supported by Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
A hard policy towards terrorism was followed
from mid-1991 onwards by the Narasimha Rao
government. In February 1992 elections, congress
came into power led by Beant Singh in Punjab.
The police became increasingly effective in its
operations. By 1993, Punjab had been virtually
freed of terrorism. Last political heavyweight to
sacrifice his life for peace in Punjab was Beant Singh.
Former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh was
assassinated in a human bomb attack. Dilawar
Singh was the human bomb: A Special Police
Officer (SPO) with the Punjab Police, he was
assigned the task of assassinating Beant Singh. He
was wearing an explosive belt underneath his
uniform, reached Beant Singh when the CM had
just stepped to his car outside assembly and pressed
the trigger. Jagtar Singh Hawara, a member of the
Babbar Khalsa International (BKI) terrorist group
headed by Wadhawa Singh, was the mastermind
behind the whole operation.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bofors scandal</i></strong></div>    
        
Rajiv Gandhi's finance minister, V.P. Singh,
uncovered compromising details about government
and political corruption, to the consternation of
Congress leaders. Transferred to the Defence
ministry, Singh uncovered what became known as
the Bofors scandal, involving tens of millions of
dollars – concerned alleged payoffs by the
Swedish Bofors arms company through Italian
businessman and Gandhi family associate Ottavio
Quattrocchi, in return for Indian contracts. Upon
the uncovering of the scandal, Singh was dismissed
from office, and later from Congress membership.
Rajiv Gandhi himself was later personally
implicated in the scandal. This shattered his image
as an honest politician; he was posthumously
cleared over this allegation in 2004.
<br>
<br>
Opposition parties united under Singh to form
the Janata Dal coalition. In the 1989 election, the
Congress suffered a major setback. With the support
of Indian communists and the Bharatiya Janata
Party, Singh and his Janata Dal formed a
government. Rajiv Gandhi became the Leader of
the Opposition, while remaining Congress
president. While some believe that Rajiv and
Congress leaders influenced the collapse of
V.P. Singh's government in October 1990 by
promising support to Chandra Shekhar, a highranking leader in the Janata Dal, sufficient internal
contradictions existed, within the ruling coalition,
especially over the controversial reservation issue,
to cause a fall of government. Rajiv's Congress
offered outside support briefly to Chandra Shekhar,
who became Prime Minister. They withdrew their
support in 1991, and fresh elections were
announced.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sri Lanka policy</i></strong></div>    
        
Then Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranasinghe
Premadasa opposed the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace
Accord, but accepted it due to pressure from then
President Junius Richard Jayewardene. In January
1989, Premadasa was elected President and on a
platform that promised that the Indian Peace
Keeping Force (IPKF) will leave within three
months. In the 1989 elections, both the Sri Lanka
Freedom Party and United National Party wanted
the IPKF to withdraw, and they got 95 per cent of
the vote.
<br>
<br>
The police action was unpopular in India as
well, especially in Tamil Nadu, as India was fighting
the Tamil separatists. Rajiv Gandhi refused to
withdraw the IPKF, believing that the only way to
end the civil war was to politically force Premadasa
and militarily force the LTTE to accept the accord.
Gandhi had concluded a visit to Sri Lanka; this
was just after the Indian Peace Keeping Force (a
contingent of India armed forces sent to Sri Lanka
to help with their battle against Tamil insurgents)
had been recalled and there was a good deal of
resentment that Indian troops had been deployed
there.
<br>
<br>
In December 1989, Singh was elected Prime
Minister and completed the pullout. The IPKF
operation killed over 1100 Indian soldiers,
5000 Tamil civilians and cost over 100 billion.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Shah Bano case</i></strong></div>
            
In 1985, the Supreme Court of India ruled in
favour of Muslim divorcee Shah Bano, declaring
that her husband should give her alimony. A section
of Muslims in India treated it as an encroachment
in Muslim Personal Law and protested against it.
Gandhi agreed to their demands. In 1986, the
Congress (I) party, which had an absolute majority
in Parliament at the time, passed an act that
nullified the Supreme Court's judgement in the
Shah Bano case. This was viewed in India that it
is against the fundamental rule of the constitution
that the law does treat everyone equal and was
seen as a strategy to appease Muslims and garner
their votes.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gorkhaland Territorial Administration</i></strong></div>
            
In 1986, the Gorkha National Liberation Front
(GNLF) was organized under the leadership of
Subhash Gheising. It started an agitation in the hill
district of Darjeeling in West Bengal around the
demand for a separate Gorkha state. After
negotiations between GNLF and the central and
state governments, a tripartite accord was signed
in Calcutta in August 1988, under which the semiautonomous Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council came
into being. The Council had wide control over
finance, education, health, agriculture and
economic development.
<br>
<br>
Lately Bimal Gurang’s GJM has emerged as the
main political force in the area. A tripartite
agreement paving the way for the setting up of the
Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA), an
elected body for the Darjeeling hills, has been
signed. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata
Banerjee and GJM president Bimal Gurung and
central government were 3 Parties concerned. The
new set-up will have 50 members: 45 of them will
be elected and the rest nominated.
As large numbers of Gorkhas sang and danced
at the site to celebrate the signing of the accord,
there was a complete shutdown in the nearby town
of Siliguri and parts of the Dooars and Terai regions
on the plains of north Bengal. Mr. Gurung has
reiterated the demand for the inclusion, under the
GTA, of the Terai and Dooars regions. A committee
set up for the inclusion of areas in the Dooars and
the Terai has recommended for meager areal
inclusion and this may provide flash point in future.
The government will also have to pay attention to
this issue.
<br>
<br>
The long-running agitation for a Gorkhaland
state in the hills was propelled by ethnic and
linguistic passions. A lesson the West Bengal
Government appears to have picked up from history
is that these passions can often turn disruptive
unless adequately addressed. Hence there is a need
to amend Article 371 to provide a constitutional
guarantee to the DGHC rather than continue to
accept its functioning under a State Act. There is
also a need to formulate an approach paper at the
political level seeking to safeguard the interests of
the Gorkhas as a dominant ethnic community with
a distinctive social and linguistic identity.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Janata Dal and Beginning of Coalition Era</i></strong></div>
            
General elections in 1989 gave Rajiv's Congress

Singh made an important visit to the Golden Temple
shrine, to heal the wounds of the past. V.P. Singh
held office for slightly less than a year, from 2
December, 1989 to 10 November, 1990. After state
legislative elections in March 1990, Singh’s
governing coalition achieved control of both houses
of India’s parliament. During this time, Janata Dal
came to power in five Indian states under Om
Prakash Chautala (Banarsi Das Gupta, Hukam
Singh), Chimanbhai Patel, Biju Patnaik, Laloo
Prasad Yadav, and Mulayam Singh Yadav, and the
National Front constituents in three more under
M. Karunanidhi, N.T. Rama Rao, and Prafulla
Kumar Mahanta. The Janata Dal also shared power
in Kerala under E.K. Nayanarand in Rajasthan
under Bhairon Singh Shekhawat (supporting the
Bharatiya Janata Party government from outside).
He started to implement the controversial
Mandal commission report, to increase the quota
in reservation for low caste Hindus. The BJP
protested these implementations, and took its

Chandra Shekhar split to form the Janata Dal

The Eighth Plan could not take off in 1990 due
to the fast changing political situation at the centre
and the years 1990-91 and 1991-92 were treated
as Annual Plans. The Eighth Plan was finally
launched in 1992 after the initiation of structural
adjustment policies.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN POLICY</i></strong></div>

V.P. Singh decided to end the Indian army's
unsuccessful operation in Sri Lanka where Rajiv
Gandhi, his predecessor, had sent it to combat the
Tamil separatist movement.
V.P. Singh faced his first crisis within few days
of taking office: terrorists kidnapped the daughter
of his Home Minister, Mufti Mohammad
Sayeed (former Chief Minister of Jammu and
Kashmir). His government agreed to the demand
for releasing militants in exchange; partly to end
the storm of criticism that followed, he shortly
thereafter appointed Jagmohan Malhotra, a former
bureaucrat, as Governor of Jammu and Kashmir,
on the insistence of the Bharatiya Janata Party.
In Punjab, Singh replaced the hardline
 Siddhartha Shankar Ray as Governor with another
former bureaucrat, Nirmal Kumar Mukarji, who
moved forward on a timetable for fresh elections.
Singh himself made a much-publicized visit to
the Golden Temple to ask forgiveness for Operation
Blue Star and the combination of events caused the
long rebellion in Punjab to die down markedly in
a few months. V.P. Singh also thwarted the efforts
of Pakistan under Benazir Bhutto to start a border
war with India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MANDAL COMMISSION REPORT</i></strong></div>

Singh himself wished to move forward
nationally on social justice-related issues, which
would in addition consolidate the caste coalition
that supported the Janata Dal in northern India,
and accordingly decided to implement the
recommendations of the Mandal Commission which
suggested that a fixed quota of all jobs in the public
sector be reserved for members of the historically
disadvantaged so-called Other Backward Classes.
This decision led to widespread protests among the
upper caste youth in urban areas in northern India.
OBC reservation (less creamy layer) was upheld by
the Supreme Court in 2008.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RAM TEMPLE ISSUE AND THE
FALL OF THE COALITION</i></strong></div>

Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party was
moving its own agenda forward. In particular,
the Ram Janmabhoomi agitation, which served as
a rallying cry for several radical Hindu organizations, took on new life. The party president,
L.K. Advani, with Pramod Mahajan as aide, toured
the northern states on a rath – a bus converted to
look like a mythical chariot – with the intention of
drumming up support. Before he could complete
the tour by reaching the disputed site in Ayodhya,
he was arrested on Singh's orders at Samastipur on
the charges of disturbing the peace and fomenting
communal tension. The kar-seva (demolition of the
mosque and construction of the temple) proposed
by Advani on 30 October, 1990 was prevented by
stationing troops at the site. This led to the
Bharatiya Janata Party's suspension of support to
the National Front government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE CHANDRA SHEKHAR
GOVERNMENT</i></strong></div>

Chandra Shekhar immediately seized the
moment and left the Janata Dal with several of his
own supporters. Although Chandra Shekhar had
a mere 64 MPs, Rajiv Gandhi the leader of the
Opposition, agreed to support him on the floor of
the House; so he won a confidence motion and
was sworn in as Prime Minister. He lasted only a
few months before Congress withdrew support and
fresh elections were called.
Rajiv Gandhi, who was rounding off one phase
of campaigning with a late-night meeting in
Sriperumbudur, forty kilometres from Madras, was
blown to pieces when a young woman, who came
forward to greet him, triggered off a bomb that she
had strapped to her waist. Widely believed, and
later proven, to be the handiwork of LTTE militants.
The killing of the forty-six-year-old Rajiv generated
a sympathy wave strong enough to give Congress
232 seats and the status of the single largest party.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMY IN 80S: THE
WATERSHED YEARS</i></strong></div>

Beginning in the late 1970s, successive Indian
governments sought to reduce state control of the
economy. Progress toward that goal was slow but
steady, and many analysts attributed the stronger
growth of the 1980s to those efforts. The realization
started occurring to country that a situation as usual
approach might have to be changed, but country
needed a shock to do the course correction, which
came in early 1990s.
<br>
<br>
The rate of growth improved in the 1980s. A
high rate of investment was a major factor in
improved economic growth. Investment went from
about 19 per cent of GDP in the early 1970s to
nearly 25 per cent in the early 1980s. India,
however, required a higher rate of investment to
attain comparable economic growth than did most
other low-income developing countries, indicating
a lower rate of return on investments. Part of the
adverse Indian experience was explained by
investment in large, long-gestating, capital-intensive
projects, such as electric power, irrigation, and
infrastructure. However, delayed completions, cost
overruns, and under-use of capacity were
contributing factors. Private savings financed most
of India's investment, but by the mid-1980s further
growth in private savings was difficult because they
were already at quite a high level. As a result,
during the late 1980s India relied increasingly on borrowing
from foreign sources.
