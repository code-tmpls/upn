<h3>India From 1991-1998</h3>

P.V. Narasimha Rao formed what was initially
a minority Congress government on 21 June, 1991
but which gradually achieved a majority, and lasted
a full five-year term. In the elections, Congress
(Indira) won 244 parliamentary seats and put
together a coalition, returning to power under the
leadership of P.V. Narasimha Rao. This Congressled government, which served a full 5-year term,
initiated a gradual process of economic liberalisation
and reform, which has opened the Indian
economy to global trade and investment. India's
domestic politics also took new shape, as traditional
alignments by caste, creed, and ethnicity gave way
to a plethora of small, regionally-based political
parties.
<br>
<br>
But India was rocked by communal violence
between Hindus and Muslims that killed over 10,000
people, following the Babri Mosque demolition by
Hindu extremists in the course of the Ram
Janmabhoomi dispute in Ayodhya in 1992.
Suffice it to say that Narasimha Rao’s regime,
despite its many achievements which are likely to
be placed in a more favourable light with a longer
historical perspective, tended to lose steam in the
last two years, with a slowing down of economic
reforms, surfacing of corruption charges and the
‘hawala’ scandal which led to charges, later found
to be almost entirely unsustainable, of bribes and
foreign exchange violations against many Congress
and opposition leaders.

OF LIBERALIZATION</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Eighth Five Year Plan (1992–1997)</i></strong></div>
            
1989–91 was a period of economic instability in
India and hence no five-year plan was implemented.
Between 1990 and 1992, there were only Annual
Plans. In 1991, India faced a crisis in foreign
exchange (forex) reserves, left with reserves of only
about US $1 billion. Thus, under pressure, the
country took the risk of reforming the socialist
economy. P.V. Narasimha Rao was the ninth Prime
Minister of the Republic of India and head
of Congress Party, and led one of the most
important administrations in India's modern history,
overseeing a major economic transformation and
several incidents affecting national security. At that
time Dr. Manmohan Singh (former Prime Minister
of India) launched India's free market reforms that
brought the nearly bankrupt nation back from the
edge. It was the beginning of privatization and
liberalisation in India.
<br>
<br>
Modernization of industries was a major
highlight of the Eighth Plan. Under this plan, the
gradual opening of the Indian economy was
undertaken to correct the burgeoning deficit and
foreign debt. Meanwhile India became a member
of the World Trade Organization on 1 January,
1995. This plan can be termed the Rao and
Manmohan model of economic development. The
major objectives included, controlling population
growth, poverty reduction, employment generation,
strengthening the infrastructure, institutional
building, tourism management, human resource
development, involvement of Panchayati Raj, Nagar
Palikas, NGOs, decentralisation and people's
participation.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economic Reforms</i></strong></div>
            
Rao decided that India, which in 1991 was on
the brink of bankruptcy, would benefit from
liberalising its economy. He appointed an economist, Dr. Manmohan Singh, a former governor of
the Reserve Bank of India, as Finance Minister to
accomplish his goals. This liberalization was
criticized by many socialist nationalists at that time.
Adopted to avert impending 1991 economic
crisis, the reforms progressed furthest in the areas
of opening up to foreign investment, reforming
 capital markets, deregulating domestic business,
and reforming the trade regime. Rao's government's
goals were reducing the fiscal deficit, Privatization
of the public sector and increasing investment in
infrastructure. Trade reforms and changes in the
regulation of foreign direct investment were
introduced to open India to foreign trade while
stabilising external loans. Rao wanted I.G. Patel as
his Finance Minister. Patel was an official who
helped prepare 14 budgets, an ex-governor of
Reserve Bank of India and had headed The London
School of Economics and Political Science. But Patel
declined. Rao then chose Manmohan Singh for the
job. Manmohan Singh, an acclaimed economist,
played a central role in implementing these reforms.
Major reforms in India's capital markets led to
an influx of foreign portfolio investment. The major
economic policies adopted by Rao include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Abolishing in 1992 the Controller of Capital
Issues which decided the prices and number
of shares that firms could issue.</li>
        <li>Introducing the SEBI Act, 1992 and the
Security Laws (Amendment) which
gave SEBI the legal authority to register and
regulate all security market intermediaries.</li>
        <li>Opening up in 1992 of India's equity
markets to investment by foreign
institutional investors and permitting Indian
firms to raise capital on international
markets by issuing Global Depository
Receipts (GDRs).</li>
        <li>Starting in 1994 of the National Stock
Exchange as a computer-based trading
system which served as an instrument to
leverage reforms of India's other stock
exchanges. The NSE emerged as India's
largest exchange by 1996.</li>
        <li>Reducing tariffs from an average of 85 per
cent to 25 per cent, and rolling back
quantitative controls. (The rupee was made
convertible on trade account).</li>
        <li>Encouraging foreign direct investment by
increasing the maximum limit on share of
foreign capital in joint ventures from 40 to
51% with 100% foreign equity permitted in
priority sectors.</li>
        <li>Streamlining procedures for FDI approvals,
and in at least 35 industries, automatically
approving projects within the limits for
foreign participation.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The impact of these reforms may be gauged
from the fact that total foreign investment (including
foreign direct investment, portfolio investment, and
investment raised on international capital markets)
in India grew from a minuscule US $132 million in
1991–92 to $5.3 billion in 1995–96. Rao began
industrial policy reforms with the manufacturing
sector. He slashed industrial licensing, leaving only
18 industries subject to licensing. Industrial
regulation was rationalised.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL SECURITY, FOREIGN
POLICY AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT</i></strong></div>

Rao energised the national nuclear security
and ballistic missiles program, which ultimately
resulted in the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests. He
increased military spending, and set the Indian
Army on course to fight the emerging threat of
terrorism and insurgencies, as well as Pakistan
and China's nuclear potentials. It was during his
term that terrorism in the Indian state of Punjab
was finally defeated. Also scenarios of aircraft
hijackings, which occurred during Rao's time ended
without the government conceding the terrorists'
demands. He also directed negotiations to secure
the release of Doraiswamy, an Indian Oil executive,
from Kashmiri terrorists who kidnapped him, and
Liviu Radu, a Romanian diplomat posted in
New Delhi in October 1991, who was kidnapped
by Sikh terrorists. Rao also handled the Indian
response to the occupation of the Hazratbal holy
shrine in Jammu and Kashmir by terrorists in
October 1993. He brought the occupation to an end
without damage to the shrine. Similarly, he dealt
with the kidnapping of some foreign tourists by a
terrorist group called Al Faran in Kashmir in 1995
effectively. Although he could not secure the release
of the hostages, his policies ensured that the
terrorists demands were not conceded to, and that
the action of the terrorists was condemned
internationally, including Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
Rao also made diplomatic overtures to Western
Europe, the United States, and China. He decided
in 1992 to bring into the open India's relations
with Israel, which had been kept covertly active
for a few years during his tenure as a Foreign
Minister, and permitted Israel to open an embassy
in New Delhi. He ordered the intelligence
community in 1992 to start a systematic drive to
draw the international community's attention to
alleged Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism against
India and not to be discouraged by US efforts to
undermine the exercise. Rao launched the Look
East foreign policy, which brought India closer
to ASEAN. He decided to maintain a distance from
the Dalai Lama in order to avoid aggravating
Beijing's suspicions and concerns, and made
successful overtures to Tehran. The 'cultivate Iran'
policy was pushed through vigorously by him.
These policies paid rich dividends for India in
March 1994, when Benazir Bhutto's efforts to have
a resolution passed by the UN Human Rights
Commission in Geneva on the human rights
situation in Jammu and Kashmir failed, with
opposition by China and Iran.
Rao's crisis management after the 12 March,
1993 Bombay bombings was highly praised. He
personally visited Bombay after the blasts and after
seeing evidence of Pakistani involvement in the
blasts, ordered the intelligence community to invite
the intelligence agencies of the US, UK and other
West European countries to send their counterterrorism experts to Bombay to examine the facts
for themselves.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Handling of separatist movements</i></strong></div>

Rao has successfully decimated the Punjab
separatist movement and neutralised Kashmir
separatist movement. It is said that Rao was 'solely
responsible' for the decision to hold elections in
Punjab. Rao's government introduced the Terrorist
and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act
(TADA), India's first anti-terrorism legislation, and
directed the Indian Army to eliminate the
infiltrators. Despite a heavy and largely successful
Army campaign, the state descended into a security
nightmare. Tourism and commerce were largely
disrupted.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BABRI MASJID DEMOLITION</i></strong></div>

A mosque was built by a governor of Babur at
Ayodhya (in Uttar Pradesh) in the early sixteenth
century. Some Hindus claimed in the nineteenth
century that it was built over a site which was the
place where Ram was born and where a Ram
temple had existed. Issue came to forefront in
December 1949 when a district magistrate permitted
a few Hindus to enter the mosque and install idols
of Sita and Ram there. Sardar Patel, as the Home
Minister, and Jawaharlal Nehru condemmed the
district magistrate's action, but the Uttar Pradesh
government felt that it could not reverse the
decision. However, it locked the mosque. The
situation was more or less accepted by all as a
temporary solution for the period of the dispute in
the court.
<br>
<br>
In 1983, VHP started a public campaign
demanding the 'liberation' of the Ram Janmabhoomi, which would entail the demolition of the
mosque and the erection of a Ram temple in its
place. Many political parties and groups did not
do anything to counter the campaign; they just
ignored it. On 1 February, 1986, the district judge
reopened the mosque, gave Hindu priests its
possession, and permitted Hindus to worship there.
The Hindu communalists demanded the demolition
of the mosque and the construction of a Ram temple
on its site.
In 1989, the VHP, keeping in view the
impending Lok Sabha elections, organized a
massive movement to start the construction of a
Ram temple at the site where the Babri mosque
stood. As a part of that objective, it gave a call for
the collection of bricks, sanctified by water from
the river Ganges, from all over the country to be
taken to Ayodhya.
<br>
<br>
To popularize the objective, it organized in 1990
an all-India rath yatra headed by its President,
L.K. Advani. The yatra aroused fierce communal
passions and was followed by communal riots in
large number of places. Thousands of BJP-VHP
volunteers gathered at Ayodhya at the end of
October 1990, despite the Uttar Pradesh government, headed by Mulayam Singh Yadav, banning
the rally. To disperse the volunteers and to prevent
them from harming the mosque, the police opened
fire on them, killing and injuring over a hundred
persons. The BJP-VHP organized a huge rally of
over 200,000 volunteers at the site of the mosque
on 6 December, 1992, with the major leaders of
the two organizations being present.
To allay the fears of injury to the mosque,
Kalyan Singh BJP chief minister of UP, gave an
assurance to the Supreme Court that the mosque
would be protected. In spite of the assurance, the
volunteers set out to demolish the mosque with
hammer blows, while government looked on. The
entire country was shocked. Communal riots broke
out in many parts of the country, the worst hit
being Bombay, Calcutta and Bhopal. The riots in
Bombay lasted for nearly a month. In all more than
3,000 people were killed in the riots all over India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MUMBAI RIOTS and 1993 BLASTS</i></strong></div>

It is 20 years since two cataclysmic events shook
Bombay now Mumbai. First—the communal
carnage spread over two months—Second, the
serial blasts of March 12, 1993, with which terror
came home to the city and claiming innocent lives.
The Srikrishna Commission, in its final report, said
the riots appeared to have been a causative factor
for the bomb blasts. Supreme Court has finally
disposed of appeals by death row convicts and actor
Sanjay Dutt in the March 12, 1993 serial blasts
case on March 21, 2013.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Latur earthquake</i></strong></div>

In 1993, a strong earthquake in Latur,
Maharashtra killed nearly 10,000 people and
displaced hundreds of thousands. Rao was
applauded by many for using modern technology
and resources to organize major relief operations
to assuage the stricken people, and for schemes
of economic reconstruction.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CORRUPTION CHARGES AND
ACQUITTAL</i></strong></div>

In July 1993, Rao's government was facing a noconfidence motion, because the opposition felt that
it did not have sufficient numbers to prove a
majority. It was alleged that Rao, through a
representative, offered millions of rupees to
members of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM),
and possibly a breakaway faction of the Janata Dal,
to vote for him during the confidence motion.
Before his death, Rao was acquitted of all the cases
charged against him.
<br>
<br>
In the 1996 general elections, Rao's Congress
Party was badly defeated and he had to step down
as Prime Minister. He retained the leadership of
the Congress party until late 1996 after which he
was replaced by Sitaram Kesri. Suffice it to say that
Narasimha Rao’s regime, despite its many
achievements which are likely to be placed in a
more favourable light with a longer historical
perspective, tended to lose steam in the last two
years, with a slowing down of economic reforms,
surfacing of corruption charges and the ‘hawala’
scandal which led to charges, later found to be
almost entirely unsustainable, of bribes and foreign
exchange violations against many Congress and
opposition leaders. The elections held in 1996 led
to Congress winning only 140 seats and BJP
increasing its tally to 161 from 120 in 1991. A shortlived BJP government lasted from 16 May to 1 June,
but failed to get majority support. A United Front
government followed this with H.D. Deva Gowda
as Prime Minister supported by Congress and CPM
in which CPI joined as a partner and India got her
first Communist home minister in Indrajit Gupta.
Congress withdrew support on 30 March, 1997,
failed to form a government, and again supported
a United Front government, this time with
L.K. Gujral as Prime Minister. The support was
withdrawn again and fresh elections held in
February 1998 that led to the formation of BJP-led
government with Atal Behari Vajpayee as Prime
Minister, as BJP, with 182 seats had the support of
parties like the TDP, AIADMK and Trinamul
Congress. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) emerged
from the May 1996 national elections as the singlelargest party in the Lok Sabha but without enough
strength to prove a majority on the floor of that
Parliament. Under Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, the BJP coalition lasted in power 13 days.
With all political parties wishing to avoid another
round of elections, a 14-party coalition led by
the Janata Dal emerged to form a government
known as the United Front. A United Front
government under former Chief Minister of
Karnataka, H.D. Deve Gowda lasted less than a
year. The leader of the Congress Party withdrew
his support in March 1997. Inder Kumar
Gujral replaced Deve Gowda as the consensus
choice for Prime Minister of a 16-party United Front
coalition. In November 1997, the Congress Party
again withdrew support for the United Front. New
elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the
largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but
this fell far short of a majority.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GUJRAL DOCTRINE</i></strong></div>

The Gujral Doctrine is a set of five principles to
guide the conduct of foreign relations with
India’s immediate neighbours, notably Pakistan, as
spelt out by Gujral. The United Front Government’s
neighbourhood policy stood on five basic principles:
First, with the neighbours like Nepal, Bangladesh,
Bhutan, Maldives and Sri Lanka, India does not
ask for reciprocity but gives all that it can in good
faith and trust. Secondly, no South Asian country
will allow its territory to be used against the interest
of another country of the region. Thirdly, none will
interfere in the internal affairs of another. Fourthly,
all South Asian countries must respect each other’s
territorial integrity and sovereignty. And finally,
settling all their disputes through peaceful bilateral
negotiations.
<br>
<br>
The logic behind the Gujral Doctrine was that
since India had to face two hostile neighbours in
the north and the west, so it had to be at ‘total
peace’ with all other immediate neighbours in order
to contain Pakistan’s and China’s influence in the
region.
Following a series of attacks attributed by the
Indian media and government to originating from
and planned in Pakistan throughout the 2000s,
culminating with the 2008 Mumbai attacks, the
Gujral Doctrine was criticised by the Indian media.
However, it was also praised in the media.
