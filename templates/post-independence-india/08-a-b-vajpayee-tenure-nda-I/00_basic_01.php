<h3>A.B. Vajpayee Tenure (NDA-1)</h3>

In November 1997, the Congress Party again
withdrew support for the United Front. New
elections in February 1998 brought the BJP the
largest number of seats in Parliament (182), but
this fell far short of a majority. On 20 March, 1998,
the President inaugurated a BJP-led coalition
government with Vajpayee again serving as Prime
Minister. On 11 and 13 May, 1998, this government
conducted a series of underground nuclear weapons
tests which caused Pakistan to conduct its own
tests that same year. India's nuclear tests prompted
President of the United States Bill Clinton and Japan
to impose economic sanctions on India pursuant to
the 1994 Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act and
led to widespread international condemnation.
In the early months of 1999, Prime Minister
Vajpayee made a historic bus trip to Pakistan and
met with Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,
and signed the bilateral Lahore peace declaration.
In April 1999, the coalition government led by
the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell apart, leading
to fresh elections in September. In May and June
1999, India discovered an elaborate campaign of
terrorist infiltration that resulted in the Kargil
War in Kashmir, derailing a promising peace
process that had begun only three months earlier
when Prime Minister Vajpayee visited Pakistan,
inaugurating the Delhi-Lahore bus service. Indian
forces killed Pakistan-backed infiltrators and
reclaimed important border posts in high-altitude
warfare.
<br>
<br>
Soaring on popularity earned following the
successful conclusion of the Kargil conflict,
the National Democratic Alliance - a new coalition
led by the BJP - gained a majority to form a
government with Vajpayee as Prime Minister in
October 1999. End of the millennium was
devastating to India, as a cyclone hit Orissa, killing
at least 10,000 under Vajpayee Government.
In 2000 May, India's population exceeded
1 billion. President of the United States Bill
Clinton made a groundbreaking visit to India to
improve ties between the two nations. In January,
massive earthquakes hit Gujarat state, killing at least
30,000.
<br>
<br>
Prime Minister Vajpayee met with Pakistan's
President Pervez Musharraf in the first summit
between Pakistan and India in more than two years
in middle of 2001. But, the meeting failed without
a breakthrough or even a joint statement because
of differences over Kashmir region
Following the 11 September attacks, the United
States lifted sanctions which it imposed against
India and Pakistan in 1998. The move was seen as
a reward for their support for the War on Terror.
India and Pakistan agreed to resume direct air links
and to allow overflights and a groundbreaking
meeting was held between the Indian government
and moderate Kashmir separatists. The Golden
Quadrilateral project aimed to link India's corners
with a network of modern highways.

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ninth Five-Year Plan (1997â€“2000)</i></strong></div>
            
The Ninth Five-Year Plan came after 50 years
of Indian Independence. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was
the Prime Minister of India during the Ninth FiveYear Plan. The Ninth Five-Year Plan tried primarily
to use the latent and unexplored economic potential
of the country to promote economic and social
growth. It offered strong support to the social
spheres of the country in an effort to achieve the
complete elimination of poverty. The satisfactory
implementation of the Eighth Five-Year Plan also
ensured the states' ability to proceed on the path of
faster development. The Ninth Five-Year Plan also
saw joint efforts from the public and the private
sectors in ensuring economic development of the
country. In addition, the Ninth Five-Year Plan saw
contributions towards development from the general
public as well as governmental agencies in both
the rural and urban areas of the country. New
implementation measures in the form of Special
Action Plans (SAPs) were evolved during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan to fulfil targets within the stipulated
time with adequate resources. The SAPs covered
the areas of social infrastructure, agriculture,
information technology and Water policy.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Budget</i></strong></div>    
        
The Ninth Five-Year Plan had a total public
sector plan outlay of Rs. 8,59,200 crores. The Ninth
Five-Year Plan also saw a hike of 48% in terms of
plan expenditure and 33% in terms of the plan
outlay in comparison to that of the Eighth FiveYear Plan. In the total outlay, the share of the centre
was approximately 57% while it was 43% for the
states and the union territories.
The Ninth Five-Year Plan focused on the
relationship between the rapid economic growth
and the quality of life for the people of the country.
The prime focus of this plan was to increase growth
in the country with an emphasis on social justice
and equity. The Ninth Five-Year Plan placed
considerable importance on combining growth
oriented policies with the mission of achieving the
desired objective of improving policies which would
work towards the improvement of the poor in the
country. The Ninth Five-Year Plan also aimed at
correcting the historical inequalities which were still
prevalent in the society.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Objectives</i></strong></div>

The main objective of the Ninth Five-Year Plan
was to correct historical inequalities and increase
the economic growth in the country. Other aspects
which constituted the Ninth Five-Year Plan were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Population control.</li>
        <li>Generating employment by giving priority
to agriculture and rural development.</li>
        <li>Reduction of poverty.</li>
        <li>Ensuring proper availability of food and
water for the poor.</li>
        <li>Availability of primary healthcare facilities
and other basic necessities.</li>
        <li>Primary education to all children in the
country.</li>
        <li>Empowering the socially disadvantaged
classes like Scheduled castes, Scheduled
tribes and other backward classes.</li>
        <li>Developing self-reliance in terms of
agriculture.</li>
        <li>Acceleration in the growth rate of the
economy with the help of stable prices.
Strategies</li>
        <li>Structural transformations and developments in the Indian economy.</li>
        <li>New initiatives and initiation of corrective
steps to meet the challenges in the economy
of the country.</li>
        <li>Efficient use of scarce resources to ensure
rapid growth.</li>
        <li>Combination of public and private support
to increase employment.</li>
        <li>Enhancing high rates of export to achieve
self-reliance.</li>
        <li>Providing services like electricity, telecommunication, railways, etc.</li>
        <li>Special plans to empower the socially
disadvantaged classes of the country.</li>
        <li>Involvement and participation of Panchayati
Raj institutions/bodies and Nagar Palikas
in the development process.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Performance</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Ninth Five-Year Plan achieved a GDP
growth rate of 5.4% against a target of 6.5%.</li>
        <li>The agriculture industry grew at a rate of
2.1% against the target of 4.2%.</li>
        <li>The industrial growth in the country was
4.5% which was higher than that of the
target of 3%.</li>
        <li>The service industry had a growth rate of
7.8%.</li>
        <li>An average annual growth rate of 6.7%
was reached.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Ninth Five-Year Plan looks through the past
weaknesses in order to frame the new measures
for the overall socio-economic development of the
country. However, for a well-planned economy of
any country, there should be a combined
participation of the governmental agencies along
with the general population of that nation. A
combined effort of public, private, and all levels of
government is essential for ensuring the growth of
India's economy.
<br>
<br>
The target growth was 7.1% and the actual
growth was 6.8%.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL HIGHWAY PROJECT,
FOREIGN POLICY AND ECONOMIC
REFORMS</i></strong></div>

During his administration, Vajpayee introduced
many domestic economic and infrastructural
reforms, including encouraging the private sector
and foreign investments, reducing governmental
waste, encouraging research and development and
privatisation of some government owned corporations. Vajpayee's pet projects were the National
Highway Development Project and Pradhan Mantri
Gram Sadak Yojana.
<br>
<br>
In March 2000, Bill Clinton, the President of the
United States, paid a state visit to India. His was
the first state visit to India by a U.S. President in
22 years. President Clinton's visit to India was hailed
as a significant milestone in the relations between
the two countries. Since the visit came barely two
years after the Pokhran tests, and one year after
the Kargil invasion and the subsequent coup in
Pakistan, it was read to reflect a major shift in the
post-Cold War U.S. foreign policy. The Indian Prime
Minister and the U.S. President discussed strategic
issues, but the major achievement was a significant
expansion in trade and economic ties. The Historic
Vision Document on the future course of relations
between the two countries was signed by
Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Clinton
during the visit.
<br>
<br>
Vajpayee promoted pro-business, free market
reforms to reinvigorate India's economic
transformation and expansion that were started
by the former PM Narasimha Rao but stalled after
1996 due to unstable governments and the 1997
Asian financial crisis. Increased competitiveness,
extra funding and support for the information
technology sector and high-tech industries,
improvements in infrastructure, deregulation of
trade, investments and corporate lawsâ€”all
increased foreign capital investment and set in
motion an economic expansion.
These couple of years of reform however were
accompanied by infighting in the administration
and confusion regarding the direction of
government. Vajpayee's weakening health was also
a subject of public interest, and he underwent a
major knee-replacement surgery at the Breach
Candy Hospital in Mumbai to relieve great pressure
on his legs.
<br>
<br>
Vajpayee again broke the ice in the Indo-Pak
relations by inviting Pakistani President Pervez
Musharraf to Delhi and Agra for a joint summit
and peace talks. His second major attempt to move
beyond the stalemate involved inviting the man
who had planned the Kargil invasions. But
accepting him as the President of Pakistan, Vajpayee
chose to move forward. But after three days of
much fanfare, which included Musharraf visiting
his birthplace in Delhi, the summit failed to achieve
a breakthrough as President Musharraf declined to
leave aside the issue of Kashmir.
In 2001, the Vajpayee government launched the
famous Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which aimed at
improving the quality of education in primary and
secondary schools.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nuclear tests (Operation Shakti)</i></strong></div>

In May 1998, India conducted five underground
nuclear tests in Pokhran desert in Rajasthan, 24 yrs
after India conducted its first nuclear test
Pokhran-I in 1974. This test was called Pokhran-II.
The tests were held just a month after the
government had been in power. Two weeks
later, Pakistan respo-nded with its own nuclear tests
making it the newest declared nation with nuclear
weapons.
<br>
<br>
While some nations, such as Russia and France,
endorsed India's right to defensive nuclear
power, others including the United States, Canada,
Japan, Britain and the European Union imposed
sanctions on information, resources and technology
to India. In spite of the intense international
criticism and the steady decline in foreign
investment and trade, the nuclear tests were
popular domestically. Effectively the international
sanctions failed completely in swaying India's
decision to weaponize their nuclear capability,
something that was planned for and anticipated
by the Vajpayee administration.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Lahore Summit</i></strong></div>

In late 1998 and early 1999, Vajpayee began a
push for a full-scale diplomatic peace process with
Pakistan. With the historic inauguration of the
Delhi-Lahore bus service in February 1999,
Vajpayee initiated a new peace process aimed
towards permanently resolving the Kashmir dispute
and other conflicts with Pakistan. The resultant
Lahore Declaration espoused a commitment to
dialogue, expanded trade relations and mutual
friendship and envisaged a goal of denuclearised
South Asia. This eased the tension created by the
1998 nuclear tests, not only within the two nations
but also in South Asia and the rest of the world.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kargil War</i></strong></div>

Even during his previous governmental
experience as the external affairs minister of India,
Vajpayee had sought to redefine Indiaâ€™s relation
with its neighbors. As the prime minister of India
he made similar attempts that ultimately proved
futile. In order to improve the relationship with
Pakistan, Vajpayee embarked upon a historic bus
journey that was to take him to Lahore. On crossing
the Wagah border post, he was given a warm
Reception by the then Prime Minister of Pakistan
Nawaz Sharif. The mask of love and brotherhood
that Pakistan wore that day had a much deeper
meaning, since Pakistani establishment was more
interested in riding a bus to Kargil than the bus of
friendship.
<br>
<br>
The two countries signed, what became known
as Lahore declaration. Emphasis was laid on solving
the disputes between them through negotiations.
Hopes were seen of a bright future, visions were
created. But all the euphoria led nowhere,
ultimately Lahore proved to be the biggest blunder
in Vajpayeeâ€™s career.
An extremely cold place, Kargil is often termed
as a no-mans land. With very little human
habitation what could be seen there is snow-tipped
mountainous terrain and Indian army trucks crisscrossing Kargil on its way to Ladakh. Strategically
Kargil is highly important for India, as it is the
only road connection between the Kashmir valley
and Ladakh. For Indian army it is the supply route
for all the essential items needed to survive in
Ladakh and Siachen. Siachen has been the bone of
contention between both India and Pakistan.
Overlooking Karakoram pass, which connects
Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (POK) with China,
Siachen has been under Indian occupation since
80s. Repeated attempts by Pakistan to capture the
glacier have failed. Kargil was an attempt by
Pakistan, to cut supply routes to Siachen and
ultimately wrest it from India. It was a carefully
thought out strategy of the Pakistani military
establishment. Using Afghani and Sudanese
mercenaries, backed by the regular Pakistani army,
it infiltrated and captured the heights near the
Srinagarâ€“Leh national highway. The plan was to
use these heights to capture the highway, ultimately
cutting off the supply routes to Siachen and
Ladakh. The infiltration was a slow process in order
to prevent Indian armed forces from detecting it. It
started soon after the Lahore bus journey of
Vajpayee. By April 1999, the infiltration had
reached dangerous proportions. Government was
taken by surprise when few army men on routine
mission of touring the checkposts in the bordering
areas of Kargil went missing. Soon aerial surveys
for the missing revealed huge illegal bunkers created
in hilltops. It was clear that Pakistan had again
backstabbed and all the hard works of Lahore had
been in vain. Vajpayee Government had in the
meanwhile been reduced to the status of a caretaker
government by the whims of Sonia Gandhi and
Jayalalitha. After loosing the majority in the floor
of the house by just one vote, Vajpayee had
resigned. But repeated attempts by combined
opposition to form a government proved futile.
Ultimately Lok Sabha was dissolved and elections
were to be held under Vajpayeeâ€™s caretaker
government. But unexpected events of Kargil forced
the election commission to postpone the elections
for the time being. What seemed to ordinary Indians
as a routine attempt by Pakistani Army to push in
militants in Kashmir valley, turned out to be a fullscale war when Indian Air Force started carrying
out repeated air raids over the hillocks of Kargil.
Afghani mercenaries, who had become rugged
and war-crazy after so many years of successful
struggle against the Russians in Afghanistan had
camped over large number of strategically placed
hills in and around Kargil region. Removing them
using conventional methods would have been
impossible, finding no other alternatives
Prime Minister Vajpayee ordered lightening air
raids over those bunkers. The air raids were
followed by military push. Guns like Bofors were
used for the first time by the armed forces.
Heavy bombardment both by the Indian Army
and the Air Force destroyed the capabilities of the
Afghani mercenaries and also dashed the hopes of
Pakistan, which dreamt of repeating Afghanistan
in Kashmir too.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indian Airlines hijack</i></strong></div>

A national crisis emerged in December 1999,
when Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from
Kathmandu to New Delhi was hijacked by five
terrorists and flown to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan.
The hijackers made several demands including the
release of certain terrorists like Maulana Masood
Azhar from prison. Under extreme pressure, the
government ultimately caved in. Jaswant Singh, the
Minister for External Affairs at the time, flew with
the terrorists to Afghanistan and exchanged them
for the passengers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Attack on Indian Parliament</i></strong></div>

The 2001 Indian Parliament attack was a highprofile attack on the Parliament of India, housing
in New Delhi by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-eMohammed terrorists. The attack led to the death
of a dozen people, including one civilian and to
increased tensions between India and Pakistan,
resulting in 2001â€“2002 India-Pakistan standoff. On
13 December, 2001, five terrorists infiltrated the
Parliament House in a car with Home Ministry
and Parliament labels. While both the Rajya Sabha
and Lok Sabha had been adjourned 40 minutes
prior to the incident, many Members of Parliament
(MPs) and government officials were believed to
have still been in the building at the time of the
attack.
<br>
<br>
One gunman's suicide vest exploded when he
was shot dead; the other four gunmen were also
killed. Five policemen, a Parliament security guard,
and a gardener were killed, and 18 others were
injured. The ministers and MPs escaped unhurt.
Indian Government initially accused Lashkare-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed to be involved in
this attack. However, Lashkar-e-Taiba denied any
involvement in the incident. In December 2002, four
JeM members were caught by Indian authorities
and put on trial. All four were found guilty of
playing various roles in the incident, although the
fourth, Afsan/Navjot Sandhu, wife of Shaukat
Hussain (one of the accused) was found guilty of
a minor charge of concealing knowledge of
conspiracy. One of the accused, Afzal Guru, was
sentenced to the death penalty for the incident.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Godhra Train Burning and Gujrat Riots</i></strong></div>

The story began on the morning of 27 February
at Godhra town in Gujarat, where a bogy of the
Sabarmati Express caught fire. 58 people, including
15 women and 20 children, were burnt to death in
the fire. The victims were all Hindus, Karsevaks or
volunteers returning from participating in a yagya
or religious ceremony at Ayodhya.
<br>
<br>
On 28 February began a wave of communal
riots that continued for almost three months. The
police and administration allegedly looked the other
way or even connived and helped. Many observers
have remarked that what distinguished the events
of 2002 was that, unlike a typical riot situation in
which two groups engage in, usually spontaneous,
violence, the assault was one-sided, premeditated,
brutal, and supported or facilitated by the state.
The Gujarat events shook the conscience of the
nation. Many high profile cases are being fought in
courts and it is believed by many that judiciary
alongwith certain well-known faces are fighting
the seemingly eternal fight against the biggest
enemy of State i.e., Communalism.
