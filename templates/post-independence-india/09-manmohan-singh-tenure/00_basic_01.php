<h3>Manmohan Singh Tenure (UPA 1 & 2)</h3>

In January 2004, Prime Minister Vajpayee
recommended early dissolution of the Lok
Sabha and general elections. The Congress Partyled alliance won in elections held in May
2004. Manmohan Singh became the Prime Minister.
The Congress formed a coalition called the United
Progressive Alliance with Socialist and regional
parties, and enjoyed the outside support of
India's Communist parties. Manmohan Singh
became the first Sikh and non-Hindu to date to hold
India's most powerful office. Mr. Singh continued
economic liberalisation, although the need for
support from Indian Socialists and Communists
forestalled further privatisation for some time.
By the end of the year 2004, India began to
withdraw some of its troops from Kashmir. And
by middle next year the Srinagar-Muzaffarabad Bus
Service was inaugurated, the first in 60 years to
operate between Indian-administered and
Pakistani-administered Kashmirs.
<br>
<br>
In 2006 February, the United Progressive
Alliance government launched India's largest-ever
rural jobs scheme, aimed at lifting around 60 million
families out of poverty.
United States and India signed a major nuclear
co-operation agreement during a visit by United
States President George W. Bush in 2006 March.
According to the nuclear deal, the United States
will give India access to civilian nuclear technology
while India agrees to greater scrutiny for its nuclear
programme. Later United States approved a
controversial law allowing India to buy their
nuclear reactors and fuel for the first time in 30
years. In 2008 July, the United Progressive Alliance
survived a vote of confidence brought after left-wing
parties withdraw their support over the nuclear
deal. After the vote, several left-wing and regional
parties form new alliance to oppose government,
saying it has been tainted by corruption. Within
three months, following approval by the American
Congress, George W. Bush signed into law a nuclear
deal with India, which ended a three-decade ban
on American nuclear trade with Delhi.
In 2007, India got its first female sworn in
President, Pratibha Patil. In 2008 October, India
successfully launched its first mission to the moon,
the unmanned lunar probe called Chandrayaan-1.
In the previous year, India had launched its first
commercial space rocket, carrying an Italian
satellite.
<br>
<br>
In November 2008, Mumbai attacks took place
and India blamed militants from Pakistan for the
attacks and announced "pause" in the ongoing
peace process. In the Indian General Election in
2009, the United Progressive Alliance won a
convincing and resounding 262 seats, with
Congress alone winning 206 seats. In mid2011, Anna Hazare, a prominent social activist,
staged a 12-day hunger strike in Delhi in protest at
state corruption, after government proposals to
tighten up the anti-graft legislation which fell short
of his demands.
Despite all this, India showed great promise
with a higher growth rate in Gross domestic
product. In January 2011, India assumed a nonpermanent seat in the United Nations Security
Council for the 2011-12 term. In 2004, India had
launched an application for a permanent seat on
the UN Security Council alongwith Brazil, Germany
and Japan.
<br>
<br>
However, 21st century India is facing the
Naxalite-Maoist rebels, in the words of Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh, India's greatest internal
security challenge and other terrorist tensions. India
in the new millennium, improved relations with
many countries and foreign unions including the
United States, the European Union, Israel and the
People's Republic of China.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC POLICY</i></strong></div>

Following the advice of International Monetary
Fund in 1991, Singh as Finance Minister, freed India
from the Licence Raj, source of slow economic
growth and corruption in the Indian economy for
decades. He liberalised the Indian economy,
allowing it to speed up development dramatically.
During his term as Prime Minister, Singh continued
to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying
widespread success in these matters. Singh, along
with the former Finance Minister, P. Chidambaram,
have presided over a period where the Indian
economy has grown with an 8–9% economic
growth rate. In 2007, India achieved its highest
GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second
fastest growing major economy in the world.
Singh's government has continued the Golden
Quadrilateral and the highway modernisation
program that was initiated by Vajpayee's government. Singh has also been working on reforming
the banking and financial sectors, as well as public
sector companies. The Finance ministry has been
working towards relieving farmers of their debt
and has been working towards pro-industry
policies. In 2005, Singh's government introduced
the value added tax, replacing sales tax. In 2007
and early 2008, the global problem of inflation
impacted India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tenth Plan (2002-2007)</i></strong></div>

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Healthcare and education</i></strong></div>

In 2005, Prime Minister Singh and his
government's health ministry started the National
Rural Health Mission, which has mobilised half a
million community health workers. This rural health
initiative was praised by the American
economist, Jeffrey Sachs. In 2006, his Government
implemented the proposal to reserve 27% of seats
in All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS),
Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian
Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central
institutions of higher education for Other
Backward Classes which led to 2006 Indian antireservation protests.
Eight more IIT's were opened in the states
of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Orissa, Punjab,
Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal
Pradesh. The Singh government also continued
the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan programme. The
programme includes the introduction and
improvement of mid-day meals and the opening of
schools all over India, especially in rural areas, to
fight illiteracy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SECURITY AND HOME AFFAIRS</i></strong></div>

Singh's government has been instrumental in
strengthening anti-terror laws with amendments
to Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).
National Investigation Agency (India) (NIA) was
also created soon after the Nov 2008 Mumbai terror
attacks, as need for a central agency to combat
terrorism was realised. Also, Unique Identification
Authority of India was established in February
2009, an agency responsible for implementing the
envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card
with the objective of increasing national security
and facilitating e-Governance.
<br>
<br>
Singh's administration initiated a massive
reconstruction effort in Kashmir to stabilise the
region but after some period of success, insurgent
infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir has increased
since 2009. However, the Singh administration has
been successful in reducing terrorism in Northeast
India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LEGISLATIONS</i></strong></div>

The important National Rural Employment
Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to
2005 during his tenure. While the effectiveness of
the NREGA has been successful at various degrees,
in various regions, the RTI act has proved crucial
in India's fight against corruption.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN POLICY</i></strong></div>

Manmohan Singh has continued the pragmatic
foreign policy that was started by P.V. Narasimha
Rao and continued by Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal
Bihari Vajpayee. Singh has continued the peace
process with Pakistan initiated by his predecessor,
Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Exchange of high-level visits
by top leaders from both countries have highlighted
his tenure. Efforts have been made during Singh's
tenure to end the border dispute with People's
Republic of China. In November 2006, Chinese
President Hu Jintao visited India which was
followed by Singh's visit to Beijing in January 2008.
A major development in Sino-Indian relations was
the reopening of the Nathula Pass in 2006 after
being closed for more than four decades. As of
2010, the People's Republic of China is the second
biggest trade partner of India.
<br>
<br>
Relations with Afghanistan have also improved
considerably, with India now becoming the largest
regional donor to Afghanistan. During Afghan
President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi in
August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid
package to Afghanistan for the development of
more schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and
defence. Under the leadership of Singh, India has
emerged as one of the single largest aid donors to
Afghanistan.
<br>
<br>
Singh's government has worked towards
stronger ties with the United States. He visited the
United States in July 2005 initiating negotiations
over the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. This
was followed by George W. Bush's successful visit
to India in March 2006, during which the
declaration over the nuclear agreement was made,
giving India access to American nuclear fuel and
technology while India will have to
allow IAEA inspection of its civil nuclear reactors.
After more than two years for more negotiations,
followed by approval from the IAEA, Nuclear
Suppliers Group and the U.S. Congress, India and
the U.S. signed the agreement on 10 October, 2008
with Pranab Mukherjee representing India.
Singh had the first official state visit to the White
House during the administration of U.S. President
Barack Obama. The visit took place in November
2009, and several discussions took place, including
on trade and nuclear power.
<br>
<br>
Relations have improved with Japan
and European Union countries, like the United
Kingdom, France, and Germany. Relations with
Iran have continued and negotiations over the IranPakistan-India gas pipeline have taken place. New
Delhi hosted an India–Africa Summit in April 2006
which was attended by the leaders of 15 African
states. Relations have improved with other
developing countries, particularly Brazil and South
Africa. Singh carried forward the momentum
which was established after the "Brasilia
Declaration" in 2003 and the IBSA Dialogue
Forum was formed.
<br>
<br>
Singh's government has also been especially
keen on expanding ties with Israel. Since 2003, the
two countries have made significant investments
in each other and Israel now rivals Russia to
become India's defence partner. Though there have
been a few diplomatic glitches between India and
Russia, especially over the delay and price hike of
several Russian weapons to be delivered to
India, relations between the two remain strong with
India and Russia signing various agreements to
increase defence, nuclear energy and space
cooperation.
15TH LOK SABHA
India held general elections to the 15th Lok
Sabha in five phases between 16 April, 2009 and
13 May, 2009. The results of the election were
announced on 16 May, 2009. Once again
the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) form the
new government under the incumbent Singh, who
became the first Prime Minister since Jawaharlal
Nehru in 1962 to win re-election after completing
a full five-year term. The Congress and its allies
were able to put together a comfortable majority
with support from 322 members out of 543
members of the House.
<br>
<br>
The 2009 Indian general election was the largest
democratic election in the world held to date, with
an eligible electorate of 714 million. Last two years
of his tenure were marred by various scams like
CWG scam, Coal Gate scam, 2G scam, etc. and
policy paralysis.
 After 30 years the BJP was able to gain majority
of its own and became the largest party in 16th
Lok Sabha and ended a collation era. The NDA
formed the government under the leadership of
Narendra Damodardas Modi.
<br>
<br>
Narendra Modi was sworn in as prime minister
on 26 May, 2014 at the Rastrapati Bhavan. He is
India's first Prime Minister born after the country's
independence. In a first of its kind, Modi invited
all SAARC leaders to attend his swearing-in
ceremony; the attendees included Prime Minister of
Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, Sri Lankan President
Mahinda Rajapaksa, Afghanistan President Hamid
Karzai, Bhutan Prime Minister Tshering Tobgay,
Nepal Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, Maldives
President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom
and speaker of Bangladesh Shirin Sharmin
Chaudhury and Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam
of Mauritius (SAARC observer).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MUMBAI TERRORIST ATTACK (2008)</i></strong></div>

The 2008 Mumbai attacks were twelve
coordinated shooting and bombing terrorist attacks
lasting four days across Mumbai, India's largest
city, by members of Lashkar-e-Taiba. Ajmal Kasab,
the only attacker who was captured alive, later
confessed upon interrogation that the attacks were
conducted with the support of Pakistan's ISI. The
attacks, which drew widespread global condemnation, began on Wednesday, 26 November and
lasted until Saturday, 29 November, 2008, killing
164 people and wounding at least 308.
Eight of the attacks occurred in South Mumbai:
at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the Oberoi
Trident, the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower, Leopold
Cafe, Cama Hospital (a women and children's
hospital), the Nariman House Jewish community
centre, the Metro Cinema, and in a lane behind
the Times of India building and St. Xavier's College.
There was also an explosion at Mazagaon, in
Mumbai's port area, and in a taxi at Vile Parle. By
the early morning of 28 November, all sites except
for the Taj hotel had been secured by Mumbai
Police and security forces. On 29 November, India's
National Security Guards (NSG) conducted
Operation Black Tornado to flush out the remaining
attackers; it resulted in the deaths of the last
remaining attackers at the Taj hotel and ending all
fighting in the attacks.
<br>
<br>
Ajmal Kasab disclosed that the attackers were
members of Lashkar-e-Taiba, considered a terrorist
organization by India, Pakistan, the United States,
the United Kingdom, and the United Nations,
among others. The Government of India said that
the attackers came from Pakistan, and their
controllers were in Pakistan. On 7 January,
2009, Pakistan's Information Minister Sherry
Rehman officially accepted Ajmal Kasab's
nationality as Pakistani. On 12 February, 2009,
Pakistan's Interior Minister Rehman Malik asserted
that parts of the attack had been planned in
Pakistan. A trial court on 6 May, 2010, sentenced
Ajmal Kasab to death on all the 86 charges for
which he was convicted. On his appeal against this
verdict, Bombay High Court on 21 February,
2011, and Supreme Court of India on 29 August,
2012, upheld his death sentence. Kasab was
executed by hanging at Yerwada Jail in Pune on
21 November, 2012.
Mumbai attacks once again proved Indian stand
right that Pakistan is directly involved in
propagating terrorism in India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COMMONWEALTH GAMES (2010)</i></strong></div>

The 2010 Commonwealth Games, officially
known as the XIX Commonwealth Games, were
held in Delhi, India, from 3 to 14 October, 2010. A
total of 6,081 athletes from 71 Commonwealth
nations and dependencies competed in 21
sports and 272 events, making it the largest
Commonwealth Games to date. It was also the
largest international multi-sport event to be staged
in Delhi and India, eclipsing the Asian Games
in 1951 and 1982. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium,
the main stadium of the event. It was the first time
that the Commonwealth Games were held in India
and the second time it was held in Asia after Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ANTI-CORRUPTION MOVEMENT
BY ANNA HAZARE</i></strong></div>

The 2011 Indian anti-corruption movement was
a series of demonstrations and protests across
India intended to establish strong legislation and
enforcement against perceived endemic political
corruption The movement gained momentum from
5 April, 2011, when anti-corruption activist Anna
Hazare began a hunger strike at the Jantar
Mantar in New Delhi. The chief legislative aim of
the movement was to alleviate corruption in
the Indian government through introduction of the
Jan Lokpal Bill. Another aim, spearheaded
by Ramdev, was the repatriation of blackmoney
from Swiss and other foreign banks.
<br>
<br>
Grievances of mass protesters focussed on legal
and political issues, including political corruption,
kleptocracy, and other forms of corruption. The
movement was primarily one of non-violent civil
resistance, featuring demonstrations, marches, acts
of civil disobedience, hunger strikes, marches and
rallies, as well as the use of social media to organise,
communicate, and raise awareness. The protests
were nonpartisan and most protesters were hostile
to attempts made by political parties to use them
to strengthen their own political agendas.
