<h3>Economy & Foreign Policy Since 1991</h3>

Until 1991, India’s policy makers followed
misguided policies that closed the economy to
international trade, erected inefficient industries
under state guidance, riddled the private sector with
extraordinarily cumbersome and detailed
regulations, and suffocated private economic
activity with controls and bureaucratic impediments. Then in 1991, the big breakthrough
happened. Spurred by a balance of payments crisis,
Indian policy makers turned to technocrats such
as Manmohan Singh, who promptly began the
process of liberalizing the economy. Trade barriers
were slashed, foreign investment was welcomed,
the License Raj was dismantled, and privatization
began. The economy started to boom, with software
exports and call centers leading the way.
Foreign lending had virtually dried up, the
government was forced to sell 20 tonnes of gold to
the Union Bank of Switzerland in March 1991 to
tide over its immediate transactions. By July 1991
foreign exchange reserves were down to a mere
two weeks' import cover despite loans from the
IMF. The country was at the edge of default.
New Economic Policy of 1991 was a Structural
Adjustment Program that allowed India to qualify
for aid from the World Bank and IMF. In 1990,
India faced an economic crisis and was on the brink
of default on its debts. Within weeks of announcing
the reform package, the government devalued the
rupee by 23 per cent (The devaluation of the rupee
had been advocated by the World Bank since
October 1990, when it recommended a 20 per cent
devaluation), raised interest rates, and effected
sharp cuts in subsidies on food and fertilizers and
transfers to public enterprises. Over the next six
months, it abolished the complex system of
industrial and import licensing, liberalized trade
policy, and introduced measures to strengthen
capital markets and institutions.
<br>
<br>
Among other measures, the new policies
announced by Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao
in July 1991 included allowing foreign firms to own
a 51 per cent stake in joint ventures in India instead
of the previous 40 per cent. The government also
eliminated requirements for some 7,500 licenses,
eliminated financial support for in form of export
subsidies, and allowed exporters to keep 30 per
cent of their net foreign exchange earnings (an
increase from 5-10 per cent).
<br>
<br>
On December 5, 1991, the World Bank made
its largest Structural Adjustment Loan to date: $500
to India. The watershed reforms contained in the
first budget the new Narasimha Rao government
submitted in June excited the Bank, and fast track
negotiations began. Initially, India was to receive
$300 million, followed by the remaining $200
million a year later if the structural adjustment
policies it agreed to remained in place.
Before 1991, India was a nation with political
independence but no economic freedom. If the
license and permit tied India down, they also stifled
individual aspirations. In the early 1990s, India's
post independence development pattern of strong
centralized planning, regulation and control of
private enterprise, state ownership of many large
units of production, trade protectionism, and strict
limits on foreign capital was increasingly questioned
not only by policy makers but also by most of the
intelligentsia. During this period, considerable
progress was made in loosening government
regulations, especially in the area of foreign trade.
Many restrictions on private companies were lifted,
and new areas were opened to private capital.
However, India remains one of the world's most
tightly regulated major economies. Many powerful
vested interests, including private firms that have
benefited from protectionism, labor unions, and
much of the bureaucracy, opposed liberalization.
Besides, many analysts agree that the poor suffered
most from the increased inflation rate and reduced
growth rate.
<br>
<br>
India’s economic performance during the first
three decades since independence was christened
the “Hindu” rate of growth, a term connoting a
disappointing but not disastrous outcome. That
cliché, of course, is gradually lapsing into disuse,
thanks to the remarkable transformation in India
during the last two decades. Since 1980, its
economic growth rate has more than doubled, rising
from 1.7 per cent (in per-capita terms) in 1950-
1980 to 3.8 per cent in 1980-2000. Shackled by the
socialist policies and the “license-permit-quota raj”
(to use Rajaji’s memorable phrase) of the past, India
used to serve as the exemplar of development
strategies gone wrong. It has now become the latest
poster child for how economic growth can be
unleashed with a turn towards free markets and
open trade. India has yet to catch up to China’s
growth rates, but thanks to its solid democratic
institutions and impressive performance in
information technology, the country is increasingly
vying with, if not displacing, China as the country
of the future in the eyes of many knowledgeable
observers.
<br>
<br>
By the early 1990s, economic changes led to
the growth in the number of Indians with
significant economic resources. About 10 million
Indians are considered upper class, and roughly
300 million are part of the rapidly increasing middle
class. Typical middle-class occupations include
owning a small business or being a corporate
executive, lawyer, physician, white-collar worker,
or land-owning farmer. In the 1980s, the growth
of the middle-class was reflected in the increased
consumption of consumer durables, such as
televisions, refrigerators, motorcycles, and
automobiles. In the early 1990s, domestic and
foreign businesses hoped to take advantage of
India's economic liberalization to increase the range
of consumer products offered to this market.
As India moved into the mid-1990s, the
economic outlook was mixed. Most analysts
believed that economic liberalization would
continue, although there was disagreement about
the speed and scale of the measures that would be
implemented. It seemed likely that India would
come close to or equal the relatively impressive rate
of economic growth attained in the 1980s, but that
the poorest sections of the population might not
benefit.
<br>
<br>
By the mid-1990s, the number of sectors
reserved for public ownership was slashed, and
private-sector investment was encouraged in areas
such as energy, steel, oil refining and exploration,
road building, air transportation, and telecommunications. An area still closed to the private sector in
the mid-1990s was defense industry. Foreignexchange regulations were liberalized, foreign
investment was encouraged, and import regulations
were simplified. The average import-weighted tariff
was reduced.
<br>
<br>
Despite these changes, the economy remained
highly regulated by international standards.
Moreover, although import duties had been lowered
substantially, they were still high compared to most
other countries. Political successes in the mid-1990s
by nationalist-oriented political parties led to some
backlash against foreign investment in some parts
of India. In early 1995, official charges of serving
adulterated products were made against a KFC
outlet in Bangalore, and Pepsi-Cola products were
smashed and advertisements defaced in New Delhi.
The most serious backlash occurred in Maharashtra
in August 1995 when the Bharatiya Janata Party
led state government halted construction of a
US $2.8 million 2,015-megawatt gas-fired electricpower plant being built near Bombay (Mumbai in
the Marathi language) by another United States
company, Enron Corporation. However these
incidents remained more of an aberration.
It is important to characterize appropriately this
attitudinal change that took place in the early 1980s.
A distinction need to be made between a pro-market
and a pro-business orientation. The former focuses
on removing impediments to markets, and aims to
achieve this through economic liberalization. It
favors entrants and consumers. A pro-business
orientation, on the other hand, is one that focuses
on raising the profitability of the established
industrial and commercial establishments. It tends
to favor incumbents and producers. Easing
restrictions on capacity expansion for incumbents,
removing price controls, and reducing corporate
taxes (all of which took place during the 1980s)
are examples of pro-business policies, while trade
liberalization (which did not take place in any
significant form until the 1990s) is the archetypal
market-oriented policy.
<br>
<br>
Two decades of liberalization in India had a
favorable impact on the overall growth rate of the
economy. This is major improvement given that
India’s growth rate in the 1970’s was very low at
3% and GDP growth in countries like Brazil,
Indonesia, Korea, and Mexico was more than twice
that of India. Though India’s average annual
growth rate almost doubled in the eighties to 5.9%,
it was still lower than the growth rate in China,
Korea and Indonesia. The pickup in GDP growth
has helped improve India’s global position.
Consequently India’s position in the global economy
has improved from the 8th position in 1991 to 4th
place in 2001; when GDP is calculated on a
purchasing power parity basis. The slowdown
experienced by the Indian economy in the late
1990s, partially due to the East Asian and Southeast
Asian crisis and a global slowdown, continued at
the turn of the century. The first few years of the
new millennium were turbulent with oil price hikes,
the 9/11 terrorist attack in the US and a further
global slowdown. Despite this, the Ninth Plan
period, 1996-97 to 2000-01, experienced an average
GDP growth of 5.5 per cent per annum against the
target of 6.5 per cent. This demonstrated the postreform Indian economy's ability to ride through
crisis years, maintaining growth rates well above
the 'Hindu rate' of 3 to 3.5 per cent
However, despite the low GDP growth in the
first year of the Tenth Plan and the poor
performance of agriculture in the Plan period, 2002-
03 to 2006-07 growth rate was slightly below the
Plan target of 8 per cent. It was a big achievement.
A critical aspect in this connection is the savings
and investment generated by the economy.
Consistently increasing rate of Gross Domestic
Savings and Investment as a proportion of GDP in
the new millennium led to this type of growth rates.
'Demographic dividend' in the form of high savings
rate was goings to continue as the already high
proportion of the Indian population in the working
age group. To ensure fiscal responsibility in view
of higher growth rates, a step was taken with the
passing of the Fiscal Reforms and Budget
Management Act (FRBMA) in August 2003. The
Act was aimed at ensuring fiscal prudence. The
rules of the Act was aimed at ensuring that revenue
deficits be reduced by half per cent or more of the
GDP every tear and be eliminated altogether by
31 March, 2009. The fiscal deficit was to be reduced
by 0.3 per cent or more of the GDP every year and
by 31 March, 2009 it was to be no more than 3 per
cent of GDP.
<br>
<br>
The economy growth rates were unprecedented
7.7% per year in the Tenth Plan period. However
even at the end of plan, many people in the country
still lacked the basic requirements for a decent living
in terms of nutrition standards, access to education
and basic health, and also to other public services
such as water supply and sewerage. Disadvantaged
groups, especially the Scheduled Castes and
Scheduled Tribes and the minorities had benefited
less than they should have. Faster, inclusive and
sustainable growth has to be the mantra of
government in such conditions. Eleventh Five-Year
Plan (2007-2012) began in very favourable
circumstances. But midway in the plan period worst
economic disaster (since 1930 recession) hit the
world and Indian economy also. The government
scaled down the annual average growth rate of 9
per cent envisaged in the 11th Plan to 8.1 per cent
in view of the global economic meltdown that
began in 2008. According to official estimates, India
achieved an economic growth rate of around 8 per
cent during the 11th Five Year Plan period (2007-
12). Though, economic growth has slipped to
decades' low of 5 per cent in 2012-13, the first year
of the 12th Five-Year Plan, due to poor performance
of farm, manufacturing and mining sectors,
fundamentals of economy are strong and return of
Indian growth story is expected sooner. Despite
the global economic crisis that engulfed the whole
world Indian economy only slowed down and did
not go into a declining phase. That shows the
resilience and inner strength of Indian Economy.
A hard landing to the discussion is being made
here, because the current economic situation will
need some time to settle down and only after the
present turmoil is over, one would be able to give
an account of present developments in a non
passionate historical way.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LPG</i></strong></div>

India's leaders believed that industrialization
was the key to economic development. This belief
was all the more convincing in India because of
the country's large size, substantial natural
resources, and desire to develop its own industries.
The Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948 gave
government a monopoly in armaments, atomic
energy, and railroads, and exclusive rights to
develop minerals, the iron and steel industries,
aircraft manufacturing, shipbuilding, and
manufacturing of telephone and telegraph
equipment. Private companies operating in those
fields were guaranteed at least ten years more of
ownership before the government could take them
over. Some still operate as private companies. The
Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, greatly
extended the preserve of government. There were
seventeen industries exclusively in the public sector.
The government took the lead in another twelve
industries, but private companies could also engage
in production. This resolution covered industries
producing capital and intermediate goods. As a
result, the private sector was relegated primarily to
production of consumer goods.
<br>
<br>
The public sector also expanded into more
services. In 1956, the life insurance business was
nationalized, and in 1973 the general insurance
business was also acquired by the public sector.
Most large commercial banks were nationalized in
1969. Over the years, the central and state
governments formed agencies, and companies
engaged in finance, trading, mineral exploitation,
manufacturing, utilities, and transportation. The
public sector was extensive and influential
throughout the economy, although the value of its
assets was small relative to the private sector.
Controls over prices, production, and the use
of foreign exchange, which were imposed by the
British during World War II, were reinstated soon
after independence. The Industries (Development
and Regulation) Act of 1951 and the Essential
Commodities Act of 1955 (with subsequent
additions) provided the legal framework for the
government to extend price controls that eventually
included steel, cement, drugs, nonferrous metals,
chemicals, fertilizer, coal, automobiles, tires and
tubes, cotton textiles, food grains, bread, butter,
vegetable oils, and other commodities. By the late
1950s, controls were pervasive, regulating
investment in industry, prices of many commodities,
imports and exports, and the flow of foreign
exchange.
<br>
<br>
Export growth was long ignored. The
government's extensive controls and pervasive
licensing requirements created imbalances and
structural problems in many parts of the economy.
Controls were usually imposed to correct specific
problems but often without adequate consideration
of their effect on other parts of the economy. For
example, the government set low prices for basic
foods, transportation, and other commodities and
services, a policy designed to protect the living
standards of the poor. However, the policy proved
counterproductive when the government also
limited the output of needed goods and services.
Price ceilings were implemented during shortages,
but the ceiling frequently contributed to black
markets in those commodities and to tax evasion
by black-market participants. Import controls and
tariff policy stimulated local manufacturers toward
production of import-substitution goods, but under
conditions devoid of sufficient competition or
pressure to be efficient.
<br>
<br>
India's current economic reforms began in 1985
when the government abolished some of its
licensing regulations and other competitioninhibiting controls. Since 1991, more "new
economic policies" or reforms have been introduced.
Reforms include currency devaluations and making
currency partially convertible, reduced quantitative
restrictions on imports, reduced import duties on
capital goods, decreases in subsidies, liberalized
interest rates, abolition of licenses for most
industries, the sale of shares in selected public
enterprises, and tax reforms. Although many
observers welcomed these changes and attributed
the faster growth rate of the economy in the late
1980s to them, others feared that these changes
would create more problems than they solved. The
growing dependence of the economy on imports,
greater vulnerability of its balance of payments,
reliance on debt, and the consequent susceptibility
to outside pressures on economic policy directions
caused concern. The increase in consumerism and
the display of conspicuous wealth by the elite
exacerbated these fears.
But forces of liberalisation, privatisation and
globalisation were not only strengthened with time,
but also the horizontal spread of area under these
forces increased at a faster rate. Promotion of FDI
(Foreign Direct Investment) by means of raising
the cap, constitution of Competition Commission
of India in place of MRTP act, liberal act on foreign
currency violations, easy sanction for FDI and FII
(Foreign Institutional Investors), etc. point towards
the above mentioned fact.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOREIGN POLICY SINCE 1991</i></strong></div>

Few events, barring the shock of the 1962 SinoIndian border war, has had as much of an impact
on India’s foreign and security policies as the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the concomitant
end of the Cold War. The Soviet collapse and the
transformation of the global order forced India’s
policymakers to make drastic changes in India’s
foreign policy at multiple levels. At a global level,
non-alignment ceased to have much meaning. As
a former Indian foreign and subsequently Prime
Minister, Inder Kumar Gujral, quite succinctly
stated, “It is a mantra that we have to keep
repeating, but who are you going to be non-aligned
against?” With the end of non-alignment for all
practical purposes, India’s foreign policy was
suddenly bereft of a grand strategic vision.
At another level, the country was also
confronted with an unprecedented fiscal crisis
partly as a consequence of the first Gulf War of
1991. Three factors contributed to this crisis. First,
anticipating a spike in oil prices because of Saddam
Hussein’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait, India
had purchased considerable amounts of petroleum
on the spot market thereby draining its treasury of
much-needed foreign exchange. Second, the
government of India was forced to repatriate over
a hundred thousand workers from the Persian Gulf
at short notice. Third, it lost the very substantial
remittances that the workers from the Gulf had
contributed to the Indian exchequer. The confluence
of these three factors placed the country in dire
financial straits. Faced with his extraordinary crisis
and also confronting the loss of the vast East
European market as a consequence of the Soviet
collapse, India’s policymakers, most notably the
then Finance Minister Manmohan Singh, chose to
dramatically alter India’s domestic and international
economic policies. These involved abandoning
the country’s historic commitment to importsubstituting industrialization, unbundling, though
fitfully at best, its vast public sector and dismantling
a labyrinthine set of regulations, licenses, permits
and quotas which had largely stifled economic
growth.
<br>
<br>
Drastic changes were also undertaken in the
political arena. As argued earlier, India’s commitment to non-alignment had already eroded in
practice, if not in rhetoric, in the post-Nehru era.
Now its policymakers sought to forge a new vision
for the country. However, the country lacked a
leader of the stature and intellectual proclivities
of Jawaharlal Nehru. Yet, the Prime Minister,
Narasimha Rao, possessed a sufficient grasp of
international affairs to recognize the necessity of
charting a new course for the country in both
domestic and international arenas. Accordingly, he
sought to chart a new course for the country’s
foreign policy.
<br>
<br>
This effort to alter the country’s foreign policy
orientation toward the emergent, sole superpower,
the United States ran into an important hurdle for
three compelling reasons. First, at a global level,
the United States had few significant interests in
India barring non-proliferation. This issue, of
course, put the two sides on a collision course as
India was a staunch opponent of the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and categorically refused
to accede to its expectations. The US, especially,
under the Clinton administration, was committed
to its indefinite and unconditional extension at the
Review Conference in 1995. Not surprisingly, their
fundamental differences put the two countries at
odds.
<br>
<br>
Second, at a regional level, even though the US
Department of Commerce had anointed India as
one of the world’s “big emerging markets”,
American investment in and trade with India was
so negligible that the nonproliferation issue
overshadowed other interests.
“Third and finally, at a bureaucratic level in
both countries the “shadow of the past” weighed
heavily on all deliberations. Most Indian foreign
policy bureaucrats looked were dubious about
American goals and interests in South Asia and
there was lingering distrust of India in both the
State and Defense departments in the United States.
These mutual misgivings hobbled the growth of
the relationship even though some small progress
had been made in the last days of Indira Gandhi
and her son and successor Rajiv Gandhi. As a
consequence of these three factors, improvements
in relations were, at best fitful, and frequently
hostage to minor, episodic differences. For example,
the Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphael’s
careless remark about Kashmir’s accession to India
at a press briefing in Washington, D.C. became a
major diplomatic contretemps.
However, Indian policymakers managed to
move with somewhat greater dexterity on other
fronts. To that end, they ended country’s reflexive
support for the Arab position on Israel and the
Palestinian question. Historically, since the creation
of the state of Israel in 1948 India had adopted for
reasons of both domestic politics and national
ideology, a mostly frosty approach toward the
Jewish state. At home Indian policymakers were
attentive to the sentiments of the Muslim
population. At an ideological level they had viewed
the creation of Israel as the continuation of a
colonial policy. In 1992, in the wake of the Oslo
Accord between Israel and the Palestinians, India
upgraded its diplomatic relations with Israel to the
ambassadorial level.
<br>
<br>
Simultaneously, India also directed its gaze
toward South-East Asia after a long span of neglect.
During much of the Cold War Indian policymakers
had shunned the states of South-East Asia, with
the critical exception of Vietnam. Now as part and
parcel of the opening of its markets to foreign
investment and seeking to develop a viable export
sector, the country embarked upon a “Look East
policy”.
Closer to home, the Narasimha Rao regime
efforts continued to improve relations with China,
a process that had been initiated during the
Rajiv Gandhi regime in the late 1980s. Even though
the two sides forged two important confidencebuilding measures (CBMs) in 1993 and 1996
designed to reduce tensions along the Line of Actual
Control, little or no progress was made in resolving
the border dispute.
Finally, relations with Pakistan, India’s longstanding adversary remained contentious as ever.
In considerable part the relationship with Pakistan
deteriorated because of the outbreak of an ethno
religious insurgency in the dispute state of Jammu
and Kashmir in December 1989. The origins of this
insurgency were mostly indigenous could be traced
to a process of growing political mobilization
against a backdrop of steady institutional decay.
However, with the outbreak of the insurgency
Pakistan’s policymakers quickly stepped into the
fray and helped transform a largely internal
uprising into an ideologically charged, sanguinary,
extortion racket.
<br>
<br>
In an attempt to suppress the insurgency India
resorted to a time-honored counterinsurgency
strategy. This involved the substantial use of force
against the insurgents but with the promise of free
and fair elections once they proved willing to
abandon their secessionist agenda. As with other
counter insurgency operations, this strategy has met
with some success. However, while it has reduced
the insurgency to manageable proportions, it has
not been able to eliminate it altogether. Continued
Pakistani logistical support for the insurgents, the
provision of sanctuaries in Pakistan-controlled
Kashmir and a porous border has prevented India
from successfully suppressing the insurgency.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CROSSING THE NUCLEAR RUBICON
AND BEYOND</i></strong></div>

Pakistan’s needling of India in Kashmir was
and remains susceptible to management through
India’s conventional military capabilities. Nor does
Pakistan’s conventional capabilities pose an
especially compelling threat to India’s security. The
conventional military capabilities, the persistence
of the border dispute and the PRC’s nuclear
weapons posed an altogether different order of
threat to India’s security. Indeed it was the longterm security threats that the PRC posed to India
proved to be the most compelling underlying factor
that drove India’s nuclear weapons program. The
specific timing of the program, contrary to much
polemical writing had little to do with the
ascendance of the right-of-center Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP) to power. Instead it was closely tied to
the successful extension of the NPT in 1995 and
the seeming inexorable efforts of the Clinton
administration to conclude a comprehensive
nuclear test ban treaty. Fearful that the test ban
treaty was all but inevitable Indian policymakers
chose to exercise the nuclear option before
ineluctable pressures were brought to bear on India
to accede to the regime.
<br>
<br>
Despite the initial burst of hostility from the
United States and the other great powers, the
international community has come to grudgingly
accept India as a de facto nuclear weapons state.
In large part this came about as a consequence of
extended bilateral negotiations between the U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott and
Jaswant Singh, the Indian Minister for External
Affairs. Also their alarmist claims and fears about
a possible nuclear exchange between India and
Pakistan have not materialized. Pakistan’s feckless
attempt to revive the Kashmir issue through its
incursion in the Kargil region did contribute to a
limited war between the two states in 1999.
However, despite the Pakistani provocation India
exercised remarkable restraint and a large-scale war
was effectively avoided. Similarly, in the aftermath
of the terrorist attack on the Indian Parliament in
December 2001 India resorted to a strategy of
coercive diplomacy albeit with mixed results.
However, it is important to note that neither of
these two crisis culminated in a full-scale war
between the two long-standing adversaries.
In the aftermath of the 2001-2002 crisis, India
and Pakistan embarked upon a peace process. The
results from this process have been limited though
it had resulted in some de-escalation of tensions on
the Kashmir front. However, in August 2008,
tensions once again came to the fore with Indian
allegations about a Pakistani violation of the
ceasefire agreement. Matters worsened considerably
after India (and the United States) alleged that
Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate
(ISI-D) was behind the attack on the Indian
Embassy in Kabul in July 2008.
<br>
<br>
While relations with Pakistan remain quite
fraught, Indo-US relations now seem to be on a
very secure footing. The Bush administration’s
willingness to exempt India from the expectations
of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (which
India had never acceded to in the first place) and
pursue a civilian nuclear agreement provided a
sound foundation for the relationship. After
protracted bilateral (and internal) negotiations the
Congress-led regime of Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh withstood a parliamentary vote of noconfidence in July 2008. There is little question that
this agreement can make a meaningful contribution
toward alleviating India’s energy needs. However,
once consummated, its larger significance will lie
in ending India’s thirty-odd years of nuclear
isolation from the global order. Since the United
States had been one of the principal protagonists
in creating and bolstering these global arrangements, the shift in American policy, which made
an exception for India, was nothing short of
revolutionary. Consequently, the American concession on this critical issue must be construed as
recognition of India’s emerging potential as a great
power in Asia and beyond.
