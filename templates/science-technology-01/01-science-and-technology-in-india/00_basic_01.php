<h3>Science And Technology In India</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEVELOPMENT HISTORY</i></strong></div>

In 1947, with the emergence of a new
politically independent nation, India continued
to march ahead pursuing a programme of using
modern science and technology for national
development. Today India spends about 1.5 per
cent of its GNP on science and technology. In
this effort not only has India established
capabilities of its own but has also cooperated
with developed as well as developing countries
in its progress towards the use of science and
technology for national development.
<br>
<br>
Soon after Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru became
the Prime Minister of India, he created a Ministry
of Scientific Research and Natural Resources,
and actively supported the atomic energy
programme for peaceful purposes. In 1948, the
Atomic Energy Act was passed and the
Department of Atomic Energy was directly
under his charge. Till his death in 1964, he was
the Chairman of the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research. His long association with
the India Science Congress Association is well
known. Under the farsighted leadership of
Nehru, the nation, the government and the
public leaders became committed to the
promotion of science and technology for
national development in a phased manner.
<br>
<br>
The enthusiastic efforts of Mr. Shanti Swarup
Bhatnagar led to the expansion of the Council
of Scientific and Industrial Research into a chain
of national laboratories spanning a wide
spectrum of science, technology, engineering
and biomedical sciences. The vision of Homi J.
Bhabha led to advanced research in nuclear
energy and other fundamental areas through the
creation of the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research (TIFR) and what has now come to be
known as the Bhabha Atomic Research Center
(BARC), and the entire gamut of activities today
coming under the Atomic Energy Commission.
Soon after assuming office, Nehru appointed
a Scientific Man-power Committee and had the
satisfaction of seeing five Institutes of
Technology come up at Kharagpur, Bombay,
Madras, Kanpur and Delhi, besides a number
of regional engineering colleges. A number of
institutions for specialized training such as the
National Institute of Foundry and Forge
Technology, School of Planning and
Architecture, the Institutes of Management and
the All India Institute of Medical Sciences were
set up. A similar expansion took place in science
education. The number of universities and
science graduates and post-graduates
multiplied. Nehru diversified the area of
operation in science and technology. India was
the first country, originally on the foot-pound
system, to change over the metric system during
the present century. In 1948, Nehru directed the
SCIR to prepare a National Register of Scientific
and Technical Personnel. The Defence Science
Organisation was set up in 1948, on the advice
of Professor P.M.S. Blackett, for the scientific
evaluation of weapons and equipment,
operational research and special studies using
scientific technique.
<br>
<br>
Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi gave the
highest priority to self- reliance in science and
technology and the achievement of selfsufficiency in food. In 1971, recognizing the
importance of developing integrated and selfreliant 
electronic capabilities in the country, she
set up the Electronics Commission. There have
been many accomplishments in the field. To
ensure that developmental activities took place
in harmony with the environment, Mrs. Gandhi
created a new Department of Environment at
the Centre in 1980. It was at her initiative that
the first Indian scientific expedition to Antarctica
took place in December 1981. She was deeply
aware of the great importance of energy for
development and, in particular, the pressing
needs in rural areas. Accordingly, she set up a
Commission on Additional Sources of Energy in
March 1981, and thereafter a Department of
Non-Conventional Energy Source.
<br>
<br>
India’s development plans have consistently
emphasised the need for sustained investment
in research and related activities leading to
creation of substantial capacity and capabilities
in science and technology (S&T). The fruits of
this effort are evident in India’s nuclear and
space programmes, information and
communication technology services, automotive
and pharmaceuticals industries and other areas.
<br>
<br>
As the Indian economy continues on the
path of rapid, more inclusive and sustainable
growth, it will be necessary to ensure that India’s
capabilities in S&T grow in strength. This is
especially important if India is to become one of
the major economies of the world over the next
20 years.
The country needs to move up from investing
1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in
the R&D sector to 2 per cent of GDP and more,
as has been the case with several developed and
emerging economies for quite some time now.
This must be achieved not only through an
additional government effort, but also a much
increased private sector effort.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION POLICY 2013</i></strong></div>

New Science, Technology and Innovation
(STI) policy has been formulated and enunciated
in 2013 and was formally released at the 100th

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TECHNOLOGY MISSIONS</i></strong></div>

The “Technology Missions” were the brain
child of Mr. Rajiv Gandhi. The missions started
in 1985 and were an offshoot of the Seventh Plan.
Launched in the fields of literacy, immunization,
oilseeds, drinking water, dairy products and
telecommunication, it had the following aims:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Make a substantial improvement in the
literacy level of the population.</li>
        <li>Immunize all infants against six diseases and
women against tetanus.</li>
        <li>Cut down imports of edible oils.</li>
        <li>Improve the availability and quality of
drinking water in rural areas.</li>
        <li>Improve milk production and rural
employment.</li>
        <li>Extend and improve the telecommunication
network especially in the rural areas.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In the light of the new industrial and
economic policies adopted by the Government,
the approach to technology development has
had to be fine-tuned. Besides enhancing the flow
of technology from abroad, the Department of
Electronics has decided to launch a series of
Technology Missions, essentially to meet the
following three objectives:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Strengthening the technology base
infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Commercializing indigenous technologies which improve the performance of
selected industries and their competitiveness.</li>
        <li>Focus attention on certain emerging and
frontier technologies.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE</i></strong></div>

Besides having the third largest scientific
manpower, India also possess a large
infrastructural network. Scientific and
technological activities in India can be classified
into these sectors, viz., (i) Central government;
(ii) State government; (iii) higher education
sector; (iv) public sector industry and; (v) nonprofit institutions/associations. These
institutional structures comprise mainly of major
scientific departments of the Central
Government, with their research laboratories,
institutions, which are the main contributors to
the research activities being carried out in the
country. These are the Indian Council of
Agricultural Research (ICAR), Indian Council
of Medical Research (ICMR), the Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE), Defence Research and
Development Organisation (DRDO),
Department of Ocean Development (DOD),
Department of Environment (DOE), and
Ministry of Science and Technology comprising
of three departments-Science and Technology,
Scientific and Industrial Research and
Biotechnology. Besides, there are other Central
Government ministries/departments and
number of research institutions under their
administrative and financial control. In addition,
there are in-house R & D units of public-sector
undertakings. The private sector industries have
established their own in-house R & D units,
which are responsible for undertaking R & D
activities for their respective industries. The state
governments have their own research institution,
which mainly comprise agriculture universities
and their research stations besides having other
research institutions directly under different
departments of the state governments.
Infrastructure for education, research and
development has expanded enormously over the
years.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Department of Science and Technology
The Department of Science and Technology,
set up in 1971, has been concerned with various
facets of promoting Science and Technology in
the Country. In this process, it has evolved policy
statements and guidelines, provided mechanisms
of coordination of areas of science and
technology for which a number of institutions
and departments have interests and capabilities,
supported grants-in-aid of scientific research
institutions and professional bodies.
By the very nature of the activities of the
department, it has to play a catalytic and
coordinating role, and, in this process over the
past few years, the efforts at promoting science
and technology in the states and union territories
have also gathered considerable momentum.

    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>India Meteorological Department (IMD)
The objectives of the India Meteorological
Department (IMD) are to provide and forecast
meteorological information on weather sensitive
activities, warning against severe weather
phenomena, and provide meteorological
statistical data. The Department has its
observatory and offices in different parts of the
country.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>National Centre for Medium Range
Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF): In order
to study and analyze the weather and
climate behaviour of particular interest to
our sub-continent, the Department has set
up a National Centre for Medium Range
Weather Forecasting (NCMRWF) with the
installation of a sophisticated supercomputer at its premises in New Delhi. The centre
is involved in developing models, which will
hopefully be able to predict the behaviour
of monsoons at least seven to ten days in
advance.</li>
        <li>Survey of India (SOI): The information
obtained from accurate surveys are
enormously useful for various development
and strategic needs. The Survey of India
(SOI), another premier organisation, is
responsible for the production of
topographical maps and providing services
to defence forces and also to other users for
various developmental activities. Modern
facilities for map making, including the
setting up of modern cartographical centre,
digital mapping centre, etc. are some of the
important schemes undertaken by the SOI.</li>
        <li>National Atlas and Thematic Mapping
Organisation (NATMO): While Survey of
India meets the national needs in
cartography, etc., some specialized thematic
maps required to meet the needs of specific

and technology activities in the country, the
Department provides grants-in-aid to 13
autonomous scientific research institutions
and the four national academies, including,
the Indian National Science Academy, New
Delhi and the India Academy of Science,
Kolkata. Thirteen autonomous research
institutions take up programme, which are
in the frontline areas of life sciences,
physical sciences and engineering sciences.
These institutions, having a large body of
scientists carrying out research, have made
very valuable contribution in the form of
research publication in prominent national
and international journals.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Department of Atomic Energy (DAE)
India embarked on an ambitious nuclear
power programme over four decades ago. The
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) set up in
1948, is the apex body, which lays down policies
pertaining to atomic energy programmes. To
execute these policies, the Department of Atomic
Energy (DAE) was formed in 1954. The activities
of DAE are grouped under research and
development, nuclear power production and
industries and minerals. The Department also
extends financial support to several institutions
carrying out basic research in nuclear and allied
sciences.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Nuclear Power Programme: To use the
country’s uranium and vast thorium
resources, a three stage atomic power
programme was envisaged in 1940s. The
ongoing first stage uses natural uranium
fuelled pressurized heavy water reactors
(PHWRs) for producing electricity. The
spent fuel when reprocessed yields
plutonium, which can be used as fuel and
results in production of more plutonium and
uranium-233 when thorium is used as a
blanket. The third stage reactors will be
using uranium-233 in the thorium cycle.</li>
        <li>Research and Development Units: R & D
activities of DAE, are concentrated at four
research centres namely the Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre, Kalpakkam; Mumbai;
Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research,

Kolkata.</li>
        <li>Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC):
Set up in 1957, the Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre (BARC) is a premier research
institution of the country working in nuclear
sciences and related fields. The country’s
first 1- MW research reactor APSARA was
built indigenously in 1956. In 1960, a 40
MW research reactor ‘CIRUS’
commissioned at Bombay for developmental
work, including production of isotopes,
experimentation, and training. ‘CIRUS’ is
still in operation. A new high flux
indigenous 100 MW reactor ‘DHRUVA’
was commissioned in August 1985 for
research in advanced nuclear physics and
production of isotopes. Other facilities of
BARC include a research reactor PURNIMA

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
APPROACH TO TWELFTH PLAN</i></strong></div>

India had made substantial investments in
the R&D sector during the Eleventh Plan period
laying a strong foundation for building a vibrant
and dynamic S&T sector in the country. Average
growth rate of publications from India in
scientific journals is about 14 per cent during the
last three years of the Eleventh Plan period. This
is against the global average of 4.1 per cent
during the same period. The share of scientific
publications emanating from universities
increased from 15 per cent in 2003 to 31 per cent
in 2012.
<br>
<br>
To face up to the increasing challenges in the
new world order, the Indian S&T landscape
needs to undergo a paradigm shift. It needs to
evolve new delivery mechanisms for innovative
deployment of technologies and business models
for financing deployment of innovations. This
calls for a well enunciated Science, Technology
and Innovation policy. The Twelfth Plan should
therefore work to develop an ecosystem that
addresses the national priority for sustainable,
inclusive and accelerated growth taking along
the education, research and corporate sectors.
The corporate sector, in particular, must play a
much larger role in building research capability
as happens in other countries.
A competitive knowledge economy must be
built on the pillars of: (i) an educational system
that produces human resources which are
employable and globally benchmarked; (ii) S&T
pursued on an enormous scale to generate
knowledge for long-term use and (iii) strategic
translational research inspired by national
needs and global opportunities. In pursuit of
these objectives the Twelfth Plan should be
geared to achieve the following:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Evolve a new Science, Technology and
Innovation policy to bring in more
resources from both public and private
sector for R&D for socially and
strategically relevant projects and
mainstream innovation- related activities
with a focus on affordable and sustainable
innovations;</li>
        <li>Catalyse a radical but participative
transformation of the Indian S&T system
by refocusing the efforts of the designated
Departments/Agencies at:
<br>
<br>
– National Focus—build partnership
with identified players of the National
Innovation System to build the
scientific, technological and human
resource niches for the country;
<br>
– Organisational Focus—address the
needs of each Department/Agency
for achieving the goals in national
focus and rigorously review the
ongoing projects/programmes to
phase out those which have by and
large fulfilled their goals; and
<br>
– Leadership Focus—stimulate the
Department/Agency’s leadership in
identified domains of science,
technology and human resource
development.
<br>
– Ensure that S&T becomes an
integral component of the national
developmental processes by
interconnecting competencies and
research resources and strengthening
interconnections with the weakly
connected stakeholders to the R&D
outputs;</li>
        <li>Increase the number of full-time
researchers/scientists from the current
level of 1.54 lakh to 2.50 lakh; the volume
of publication outputs in basic research
from a global share of 3 per cent to, say,
5 per cent; improve the global ranking
from 9th to 6th by the end of the Twelfth
Plan; focus on doubling the number of
patents and increase the
commercialization of patent portfolio to
5–6 per cent from a level of less than 2
per cent;</li>
        <li>Increase R&D expenditure to 2 per cent
of GDP and significantly enhance
corporate sector R&D expenditure to at
least 1 per cent of GDP by attracting
investments and engaging the corporate
sector in R&D through policy and reforms
processes; earmark 10–15 per cent of public
investment exclusively for public–private
partnership (PPP) R&D to private sector
through the competitive grant process
with a stipulation that comparable
provisions would be made by the private
sector under PPP model;</li>
        <li>Provide more flexibility to the younger
generation of scientists to pursue their
ideas and greater mobility between
industry, academia and R&D institutions;
strengthen gender parity in R&D by way
of mobility and women re-entry
programmes; consolidate on the gains
achieved during the Eleventh Plan in
nurturing students to pursue science as a
career;</li>
        <li>Build technology partnerships with States
through new models of technological
solutions, design, development and
delivery;</li>
        <li>Initiate Grand Challenge Programmes and
launch PAN-India missions to address
national priorities in various
developmental sectors through bottom up
approach, particularly in the areas of
Health, Water, Energy and Food through
consortia of institutions and agencies
cutting across public and private sectors;
two major areas which require immediate
focus during Twelfth Five Year Plan are
Energy and Water;</li>
        <li>Encourage large Indian industries to
establish globally benchmarked R&D
centres on the lines of R&D centres set up
by multinational companies (MNCs);</li>
        <li>Leverage the large-scale innovative
component of strategic research spin-offs
from defence, space and atomic energy
for civilian benefits in a much larger
segment.</li>
        <li>Create new Inter-University Centres
(IUCs) and Inter-Institutional Centres
(IICs) in chosen areas of Science and
Engineering, which will provide access to
state-of-the-art facilities and academic
ambience for researchers in universities
and academic institutions;</li>
        <li>Create new R&D institutions in transdisciplinary science and engineering to
achieve leadership positions;</li>
        <li>Create Peta-scale supercomputing
facilities and provide high-performance
computing for various applications such
as climate modelling, weather prediction,
aerospace engineering, computational
biology, nuclear applications, earthquake
simulations, animation in movies, national
security and finance;</li>
        <li>Create an independent institutional
arrangement for Technology Assessment
capability.</li>
        <li>Partner with high-value global mega
projects in the areas of contemporary
scientific interest and technological
relevance and enhance India’s role in
global mega projects;</li>
        <li>Enhance collaboration with reputed
foreign universities/agencies towards
addressing the scientific aspects of
common interest and global in nature.</li>
    </ul>
