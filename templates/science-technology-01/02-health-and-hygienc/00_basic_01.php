<h3>Health & Hygienc</h3>

Health and human development form
integral components of overall socio-economic
development of any nation. Under the
Constitution, Public health and sanitation,
hospitals and dispensaries fall in the state list.
Population control and family planning, medical
education, adulteration of food stuffs and other
goods, drugs and poisons, medical profession,
vital statistics, including registration of births
and deaths, lunacy and mental deficiency are
in the concurrent list. Union Ministry of Health
and Family Welfare plays a vital role in the
national efforts to help citizens lead a healthy
and happy life. The ministry is responsible for
implementing programmes of national
importance like family welfare, primary health
care services, prevention and control of disease,
etc. which form the main plank of our
development efforts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIAN MEDICINE SYSTEMS</i></strong></div>

The traditional systems of medicine are of
great relevance to the health care of the people.
It is calculated that majority of the world
population are still relying on traditional system.
Kerala is the first state in the country, which
separates the traditional systems of medicine into
Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Yoga & Naturopathy
respectively. Indian systems of medicine (ISM)
include all the non-allopathic systems of
medicine and regimens, excluding Homeopathy,
viz. Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani, Nature Cure,
Yoga, Tibbia and Amchi.
<br>
<br>
Ayurveda and Siddha are the most ancient
ISM practised in India. These deal with
preventive, promotive and curative concepts of
health and are holistic systems of medicine
dealing with body, mind, soul and the
phenomena of nature. Ayurveda makes use of
the medicinal properties of plants. Siddha is
practised mainly in Tamil-speaking and nearby
areas
Unani system of medicine has a long and
impressive record in India. Having its origin in
Greece, it was introduced by the Arabs in India.
It also adopts holistic approach. Main types of
treatment are regimen therapy, diet therapy,
pharmaco-therapy and surgery.
<br>
<br>
Naturopathy is commonly known as
drugless treatment of disease and is based mainly
on the ancient practices of the application of the
simple laws of nature. It lays special emphasis
on eating and living habits, adoption of
purificatory measures, use of hydrotherapy, cold
packs, mud packs, baths, massage, etc.
Yoga is as old as Ayurveda. It was about
2500 years back when Patanjali propounded it
in a systematic form, which consists of eight
components. Yoga helps in improving physical,
mental and social well-being as also builds up
improved resistance to disease and endurance
against stress.
Homeopathy is based on the principle of
Simila Similibus Curantur, i.e., like cures, and
that too with minute doses of medicines, and was
discovered by the German physician Dr.
Christian Frederick Samuel Hannemann.
<br>
<br>
Homeopathy has wide acceptability because of
its holistic and intrinsic values, low cost medicines
and absence of any side effects of the drug.
Sowa-Rigpa Became Part Of Indian Medical
System:
<br>
<br>
The Parliament on August 31, 2010 adopted
a Bill to recognise within the definition of Indian
medicine the Sowa-Rigpa system practised in
sub-Himalayan region of the country. The Indian
Medicine Central Council (Amendment) Bill,
2010 was then passed by a voice vote by the Lok
Sabha. Rajya Sabha had passed the Bill on
August 25.
It is practiced in the sub-Himalayan region
and other parts of the country, besides Tibet,
Mongolia, Japan and some other countries. The
Bill seeks to include registered practitioners of
Sowa-Rigpa in the Indian Medical Council. The
Indian Medicine Central Council (Amendment)
Bill, 2010, seeks to include Sowa-Rigpa along
with Ayurveda, Siddha and Unani medicine in
the system, set minimum standards for
education, and maintain a register of all
practitioners in these fields.
<br>
<br>
The Bill would ensure protection and
preservation of the Sowa-Rigpa system and help
in its development. Besides, it would lead to the
setting up of a regulatory mechanism in the
education and practice of Sowa-Rigpa. The
government will take all steps for research and
development of the Sowa-Rigpa system with a
regulatory body in place. The legal recognition
of ‘Sowa-Rigpa’ will help in preserving this
ancient system of medicine along with boosting
its education and practice. It will also open new
avenues of research and development of new
medicines by combining new techniques with
‘Sowa-Rigpa’.
<br>
<br>
The government had also decided to set up
a Pharmacopoeia Commission for Indian
Systems of Medicine, which now would also
include Sowa-Rigpa. The passage of the Bill will
enable setting minimum standards for education
and maintain a register of all practitioners of
Sowa-Rigpa. It was being done as recommended
by the National Medicinal Plant Board, which is
working on Indian herbs and plants used in
various traditional systems. A task force was set
up by the Health Ministry to reach out to
inaccessible areas and places, where tribals live
in, to identify their system of medicine and
practitioners.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sowa Rigpa or commonly known as
‘Amchi’ is an ancient system of Tibetan medicine.</li>
        <li>Since ancient times this system has been
used to cure people in Sikkim, Jammu &
Kashmir, Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh and
other Himalayan belt of the population.</li>
        <li>Sowa Rigpa is practiced in many
countries. But due to its origin in ancient
Tibet, it is also known as Tibetan medicine.</li>
        <li>This ancient system of treatment
resembles Ayurveda but it also has some
principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</li>
        <li>It is believed that Lord Buddha taught
the fundamental text book rgyud-bzhi of
‘Sowa-Rigpa’.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In order to strengthen the AYUSH systems
and their revalidation, various initiatives have
been taken by the Health Ministry. These include
infrastructure development by establishing five
Research Councils dedicated for research in each
of the AYUSH systems; establishment of
Pharmacopoeia Commission of Indian Medicine
for developing standards of Ayurveda, Siddha
and Unani drugs; promoting collaboration
among various research councils under different
ministries as well as universities and
organizations. The interdisciplinary research
involving scientists of basic sciences, chemists,
pharmacologists, biologists as well as engineers
has also been encouraged in core areas of
research in AYUSH systems. These include
Fundamental Research comprising of
interpretation and revalidation of basic principles
of AYUSH systems; Literature Research covering
revival, preservation, translation, critical
analysis, systematization and publication of
manuscripts; Drug Research including Medical,
Ethnic and Botanical Surveys, Cultivation of
Medicinal Plants, Standardization and Quality
control, Preclinical safety, Toxicity and Biological
activity screening and Clinical Research
encompassing observation studies and phased
clinical trials. Modern advanced technologies like
Genomics are also being used to study the
fundamental concepts of Prakriti; i.e. Body
constitution described in Ayurveda. AYUSH
drugs are being studied with advanced
techniques for their activity on immune systems
in disease like HIV-AIDS, for Anti-cancer activity
and Anti-diabetic activity. In order to make
research findings in AYUSH systems and allied
faculties accessible through the web, the
Department of AYUSH has developed an
AYUSH research portal which can be accessed
by everyone.
<br>
<br>
During 12th plan period stress is likely to be
given on Integration of AYUSH systems in health
care delivery and their incorporation in National
Health Programmes through co-locating such
facilities at sub-centres and primary health care
centres.
Some of the new initiatives which are under
consideration during the 12th Plan include,
setting up of a National Commission for Human
Resource in; Referral hospitals in 8 National
Institutes to provide world class treatment
facilities; a National Institute of Medicinal Plants;
Research and Quality Control Laboratories in 8
National Institutes; a Central Drugs Controller
for AYUSH drugs to facilitate standardization
of ASU products; 5 Hi-Tech Quality Control
Labs under the Research Councils at regional
levels; setting up of a Homoeopathic Medicines
Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited to provide
facilities for manufacturing of Homoeopathic
medicines and to set up an All India Institute of
Homoeopathy to fulfil the emerging interest of
scientists for research in homoeopathy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IMMUNITY AND IMMUNISATION
PROGRAMMES</i></strong></div>

The resistance of the body to the effects of
pathogenic organisms is called Immunity. It is
an important defence mechanism of the body to
fight against several diseases. Immunity may be
active or passive.
<br>
<br>
<b>Active Immunity:</b> It develops as a result of
the contact of an individual with pathogenic
organisms or their products. These stimulate the
body to produce antibodies (gamma globulin
proteins) in response to the antigens (foreign
substances). The immunity thus produced is
specific for a particular disease, for example, the
immunity established against chicken pox or
measles is not effective against cholera or
tuberculosis. Immunity may be acquired either
through the infection of a pathogen or
administration of a vaccine (a suspension of
attenuated or killed microorganisms). Active
immunity takes a few weeks to a few months to
develop but persists for long periods.
<br>
<br>
<b>Passive Immunity:</b> It is produced when
antibodies formed in one human being are
transferred to another. It may be acquired
through -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Transmission of maternal antibodies to
the foetus through the placenta e.g.
chicken pox, measles, diphtheria, polio,
tetanus.</li>
        <li>Injection of antiserum (blood plasma
containing anti-bodies) prepared against
a specific disease e.g. tetanus, diphtheria
or rabies.</li>
        <li>Administration of immune globulins or
human gamma globulins.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The transfer of lymphocytes also gives
passive cellular immunity against viruses,
intercellular bacteria, fungi and some protozoa.
Passive immunity is rapidly established but
lasts for a short while. Passive immunization has
therefore limited utility as compared to active
immunization and is used mainly as a short-term
preventive measure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Immunization Programme</i></strong></div>

Reduced immunity of the body results in its
unusually high susceptibility to infection and
may lead to a number of disorders or diseases.
Immune deficiencies may arise due to some
genetic defects in the body. They may also be
acquired as a consequence of malnutrition,
metabolic abnormalities, and exposure to X-rays,
toxic effects of drugs or pathogenic organisms.
A virus has been identified to be responsible
for Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome
(AIDS). The AIDS virus is believed to have
originated in the African green monkey and then
spread to humans. It is known to get transmitted
from the infected persons to other not through
casual contact, but through either sexual contact
or blood transfusions or contaminated injection
needles. In the host, this virus attacks those White
Blood Corpuscles (WBC), which are responsible
for developing the immunity. As it multiplies
within the WBC at an exceedingly fast rate, it
devastates the immune system of the body. AIDS
virus can also cause serious damage to brain that
may lead to loss of memory and impaired ability
to speak and think. No suitable drug is known
at present for treatment of the disease and no
vaccine has so far been developed for use as
preventive measure.
<br>
<br>
Recognising the potential of immunization
as a low-cost efficient technology for child
survival and prevention of disabilities,
Government started the Expanded Programme
on Immunization (EPI) in 1978 with the objective
of reducing the morbidity, mortality and
disability due to diphtheria, whooping cough,
tetanus and tuberculosis by making free
vaccination services easily available to all eligible
children and expectant mothers.
Polio vaccine was included in the programme
during 1979-80 and tetanus oxide in 1980-81.
BCG was brought under EPI in 1981-82 and
measles vaccine was initiated in 1985-86. The
immunization programme is a long term one.
The immunization services are provided through
the existing health care delivery system.
<br>
<br>
The Universal Immunisation Programme
(UIP) was launched in 1985 as part of the overall
national strategy to bring down infant and
maternal mortality in the country by providing
immunisation to all infants against six vaccinepreventable 
diseases (tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus,
poliomyelitis, and measles) and pregnant women
against tetanus. Prior to 1985, immunisation
activity was implemented under the Family
Welfare Programme, but the scheme was limited
primarily to major hospitals and the coverage
levels were also very low.
When this programme was launched in
1985, infant mortality for the country as a whole
was 97 for every 1000 live births. It was estimated
that vaccine preventable diseases were
responsible for about one-fourth of the total
infant deaths. Neo-natal tetanus itself was
responsible for 13 out of every 1000 infant deaths,
i.e., a total of 200,000 deaths every year. 150,000
children, in the absence of immunisation, are
likely to develop paralytic poliomyelitis every
year.
<br>
<br>
In 1986, the Universal Immunisation
Programme was named as one of the Technology
Missions and the following objectives were spelt
out:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To cover all pregnant women against
tetanus and at least 85 per cent of all
infants against six vaccine preventable
diseases by March 1990.</li>
        <li>To increase production, upgrade testing
facilities and develop the means, support
and distribution of vaccines at the
required low temperatures to maintain
their potency.</li>
        <li>To achieve self-sufficiency in vaccine
production and manufacture of cold
chain equipment.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The programme was given the status of a
National Technology Mission in 1986 (GoI, 1988)
to provide a feeling of urgency and commitment
to achieve the goals within the specified period.
UIP became a part of the Child Survival and
State Motherhood (CSSM) Programme in 1992
and Reproductive and Child Health (RCH)
Programme in 1997. The Government of India
constituted a National Technical Committee on
Child Health on 11th June, 2000 and launched
Immunization Strengthening Project on
recommendation of the Committee. The
Department of Family Welfare established a
National Technical Advisory Group on
Immunization on 28th August, 2001 to assist GoI
in developing a nationwide policy framework
for vaccines and immunization.
For almost two decades, UIP did not add any
additional vaccine. However, since 2006,
vaccines namely Hepatitis B, second dose of
measles and Japanese Encephalitis (JE) vaccine
have been introduced. During the same period,
a number of other safe and efficacious vaccines
have become available for major killers like
pneumonia and diarrhoea, which are being used
in the immunization programmes of many
developing and developed countries.
<br>
<br>
According to United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) vaccine preventable diseases
(VPDs) cause an estimated 2 million deaths or
more every year, of which approximately 1.5
million deaths occur among children below five
year age. These 1.5 million deaths represent
approximately 15 percent of under-five deaths.
Reducing child mortality by two thirds between
1990 and 2015 is the fourth of eight Millennium
Development Goals endorsed by world leaders
in the Millennium Declaration in 2000.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DESCRIPTION ABOUT DISEASES</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Dengue</i></strong></div> 
        
Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by the
bite of an infected female Aedes mosquito. There
are four distinct serotypes of the dengue virus
(DEN 1, DEN 2, DEN 3 and DEN 4). Symptoms
appear in 3–14 days (average 4–7 days) after the
infective bite. Dengue fever is a flu-like illness
that affects infants, young children and adults.
There is no specific treatment for dengue
fever. Severe dengue is a potentially lethal
complication but early clinical diagnosis and
careful clinical management by experienced
physicians and nurses often save lives.
More than 70 per cent of the disease burden
is in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific.
In Latin America and the Caribbean, the
incidence and severity of disease have increased
rapidly in recent years. The African and Eastern
Mediterranean regions have also recorded more
outbreaks of the disease in the last ten years.
Urbanization, rapid movement of people and
goods, favourable climatic conditions and lack
of trained staff have all contributed to the global
increase of dengue.
<br>
<br>
The latest research has shown that the
dengue fever virus can mutate much more
rapidly than anyone though, which could
thwart the efforts of the scientists to create a
vaccine. Over the past few decades, the
mosquito-borne virus has spread dramatically
and now about 50 million people each year are
affected in tropical areas. About 40 per cent of
the world population is at risk. The phenomenon
of global warming will further allow the virus
to increase its range. The development of an
effective vaccine that protects against each of the
four main types of the dengue virus has proved
difficult, as a successful vaccine might not remain
effective for long. The scientists have found that
two mutated strains of dengue-I caused 25 per
cent of 15,000 cases in Myanmar in 2001. These
strains evolved locally within a year. Two
different dengue-2 strains had recombined in a
mosquito to create a third strain, which showed
the direct evidence that new strains can emerge
anytime. In 2002 researchers found that two new
strains of a dengue-3 virus in Thailand had
evolved in less than a year replacing the
dominant local strain and causing the biggest
dengue epidemic in Thailand.</li>
        <li>Cancer Control
In India, it is estimated that there are about
two million cancer patients at any given point
of time with 0.5 million new cases coming every
year. The following new schemes have been
initiated starting from the year 1990-91:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Scheme for district projects for
preventive health education, early
detection and pain relief measures:
Under the scheme financial assistance
of Rs. 15 lakh is provided to the
concerned State Governments for each
district project selected under the
scheme. The projects are implemented
through the State Governments and
concerned Regional Cancer Centres/
Government Medical Colleges having
reasonably good facilities for treatment
of cancer.</li>
        <li>Scheme for development of Oncology
wings of Medical Colleges/hospitals:
This scheme has been initiated to fill up
geographical gaps in the availability of
cancer treatment facilities in the
country. According to the scheme,
financial assistance upto Rs. One crore
is provided to the concerned State
Government for procurement of
equipment which includes one Cobalt
Unit. The civil works and manpower
are to be provided by the concerned
State Government/Institution.</li>
        <li>Scheme for financial assistance to
Voluntary Organisations: Under the
Scheme, financial assistance upto Rs. 5
lakh is provided to the registered
voluntary organisations recommended
by the State Government for the
purpose, for undertaking health
education and early detection activities
in cancer.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Adication</i></strong></div>    
        
Malaria is onMalaria Ere of the major public health
problems of the country. Around 1.5 million
laboratory confirmed cases of malaria are
annually reported in India. The organised Public
Health Programme to control malaria was
launched in India in the year 1953, the
encouraging results of which prompted Govt. of
India to switch the strategy from control to
eradication in 1958. The National Malaria
Eradication Programme made spectacular
progress till 1965. But this success was short-lived.
In 1976, the number of confirmed malaria cases
reached 6.47 million which necessitated
renewed vigorous anti-malaria activities and the
programme was modified.
<br>
<br>
After all these programmes, numbers of
malaria cases have increased in the urban areas.
The causative agent for common malaria,
Plasmodium vivax, was eradicated satisfactorily
while the Plasmodium falciparum responsible
for spreading more lethal form of malaria, the
cerebral malaria, showed an upward trend
during 70s and thereafter. The multi-drug
resistant strain of the disease also threatens to
pose serious problems owing to inadequate
coverage of the programme and lack of
coordination between public and private health
care systems.
<br>
<br>
It is proposed to intensify the efforts for the
full containment of the disease to acceptable
levels. Accordingly, major focus is being given
to insecticidal spraying for vector control in areas
having more than 2/1000 cases reported and
early cases detection and treatment. In the
remaining areas, focal spraying and effective
case surveillance is being taken up. These efforts
are being appropriately developed with training
of workers and enthusing community
participation, alongside decentralisation of drug
distribution and fever treatment etc.
Around 50 per cent of the total malaria cases
reported is due to P.falciparum. One of the
reasons attributed to rise in proportion of P.
falciparum cases is resistance to chloroquine,
which was used for a long time as the first line
of treatment of malaria cases. P. falciparum
infections are known to lead to severe malaria,
if timely treatment with effective drugs is not
administered.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

With a view to bring down the incidence of
malaria in the country, it is now under
consideration to revise the approaches adopted
earlier. The new strategy consists of an attempt
to : (i) categorise the infected areas into high,
moderate and low for a more focused, needbased, cost-effective and rational implementation
of anti-malarial measures (this approach of
malariogenic stratification is being attempted in
the States of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat,
Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya
Pradesh); (ii) focused attention to the tribal areas
of all 14 States (while tribals constitute 8 per cent
of the P. falciparum cases in the country); and
(iii) control urban malaria which is indicating a
very high trend in the levels of incidence.
National Drug Policy on Malaria (2010)
The National Drug Policy on Malaria was
first formulated in 1982 and has subsequently
been reviewed and revised periodically. The
present National Drug Policy for Malaria (2010)
has been drafted keeping in view the availability
of more effective antimalarial drugs and drug
resistance status in the country.
<br>
<br>
Early diagnosis and complete treatment is one
of the key strategies of the National Malaria
Control Programme. All fever cases clinically
suspected of malaria should be investigated for
confirmation of malaria by either microscopy or
Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT). As and when the
bivalent RDT is introduced, it will be used for
diagnosis of malaria cases at the field level in
remote areas where microscopy is not available
within 24 hrs. of starting of fever. In high
P.falciparum predominant areas where it is not
possible to get microscopy results within 24
hours, ASHAs/other community health
volunteers/MPWs should be provided with
rapid diagnostic kits and anti-malarials
(including ACT) for early diagnosis and
treatment of P.falciparum cases.
Effective treatment of malaria under the
National Drug Policy aims at:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing complete cure (clinical and
parasitological) of malaria cases.</li>
        <li>Prevention of progression of
uncomplicated malaria into severe malaria
and thereby reduce malaria mortality.</li>
        <li>Prevention of relapses by administration
of radical treatment.</li>
        <li>Interruption of transmission of malaria by
use of gametocytocidal drugs.</li>
        <li>Preventing development of drug
resistance by rational treatment of malaria
cases.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Urban Malaria Scheme</i></strong></div>

<b>The Urban Malaria Scheme (UMS)</b> came into
effect in 1971. The main objective of the Scheme
is to control malaria by reducing the vector
population in the urban areas through recurrent
anti-larval measures. At present, Urban Malaria
Scheme is protecting 130.3 million population
from malaria as well as from other mosquito
borne diseases in 131 towns in 19 States and
Union Territory.
<br>
<br>
Madhok Committee in 1970, investigated the
problem and assessed that 10 to 12% of total
cases were contributed by urban areas. The
committee recommended anti larval measures
for containment of urban malaria, because it was
feared that proliferation from urban to rural may
spread and nullify the gains already made.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Kala-Azar Control</i></strong></div>

Kala-azar has become a serious public health
problem in Bihar and West Bengal. After its
resurgence in Bihar in early 70s, the disease
spread from 4 districts to adjoining areas and
30 districts in Bihar and 9 districts in West
Bengal were affected by Kala-azar. As evident,
the problem has assumed serious dimensions in
Bihar, where there has been a steep rise in
reported incidence which itself is not an actual
magnitude of the problem because some cases
go to private practitioners and remain
unreported.
<br>
<br>
In view of the rising problem, organised
control measures were initiated to control Kalaazar. Until 1990-91, the assistance for Kala-azar
control was being provided by Government of
India out of NMEP budget provision.
The strategy for Kala-azar control broadly
includes 3 major activities:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Interruption of transmission for
reducing vector population by
undertaking indoor residual insecticidal
spray twice annually,</li>
        <li>Early diagnosis and complete treatment
of Kala-azar cases,</li>
        <li>Health education for community
awareness in its involvement.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Filaria Control</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What is Filaria?</i></strong></div>

Filariasis is caused by several round, coiled
and thread-like parasitic worms belonging to the
family filaridea. These parasites after getting
deposited on skin penetrate on their own or
through the opening created by mosquito bites
to reach the lymphatic system. The disease is
caused by the nematode worm, either
Wuchereria bancrofti or Brugia malayi and
transmitted by ubiquitous mosquito species
Culex quinquefasciatus and Mansonia
annulifera/M.uniformis respectively.
Filariasis is a major public health problem in
India. Whenever the disease becomes chronic, it
is irreversible. The disease has been prevalent
throughout India except Jammu & Kashmir,
Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Mizoram,
Meghalaya, Tripura, Manipur, Rajasthan,
Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi, Chandigarh,
Haryana, Sikkim & Nagaland. Present estimate
indicates that about 389 million people are living
in 175 known endemic districts of which about
103 million are living in urban areas and the rest
in rural areas.
<br>
<br>
For the control of Filariasis, the National
Filaria Control Programme was launched in
1955. Under the Programme, the following
activities have been undertaken:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Delimitation of the problem in hitherto
unsurveyed areas;</li>
        <li>Control in urban areas through:
            <ol>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recurrent anti-larval measures.</li>
                    <li>Antiparasitic measures.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The National Filaria Control Programme
carries out anti-larval anti-mosquito measures,
establishes filaria clinics and makes provision for
underground drainage. Training in Filariology
is imparted at three regional Filaria Training and
Research Centres, situated at Calicut,
Rajamundary and Varanasi under the National
Institute of Communicable Diseases of Delhi.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Leprosy Eradication</i></strong></div>

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused
by Mycobacterium leprae. It usually affects the
skin and peripheral nerves, but has a wide range
of clinical manifestations. The disease is
characterized by long incubation period
generally 5-7 years and is classified as
paucibacillary or mulitbacillary, depending on
the bacillary load. Leprosy is a leading cause of
permanent physical disability. Timely diagnosis
and treatment of cases, before nerve damage has
occurred, is the most effective way of preventing
disability due to leprosy.
<br>
<br>
The Government of India launched the
National Leprosy Eradication Programme in
1983 with the objective of arresting the
transmission of the disease by 2000 A.D. It is a
100 per cent Centrally-sponsored programme.
The strategy adopted under the programme
involves : (a) provision of domiciliary multi-drug
treatment coverage in 135 districts having
problems of 5 or more cases per 1000 population,
by specially trained staff in leprosy; (b)
introduction of modified MDT scheme in the
remaining 66 endemic districts through existing
health care staff; (c) introduction of MDT services
through existing general health care services in
the low endemic districts ; (d) Multi-drug
therapy to Dispose refractory cases in other
districts. Treatment with combination of drugs
includes treatment with 3 drugs, viz. Rifampicin,
Clofazimine and Dapsone. Education of the
patients and the community about the curability
of the disease and their socio-economic
rehabilitation are other two key components of
the control strategy.

<br>
The national Institute of Immunology (NII),
New Delhi has developed an anti- leprosy drug.
It was introduced on January 30, 1998, the 50th
death anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.
The central government appointed a
working group headed by the eminent scientist
Dr M.S. Swaminathan to develop an action plan
for eradicating leprosy. The working group's
recommendations include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Control programme should be renamed
as eradication programme with time
bound and specific goal of arresting the
disease activity in all leprosy cases by the
turn of the century;</li>
        <li>Existing dapsone monotherapy
supplemented with one or more
bactericidal drugs (multi-drug treatment)
for treatment of the disease to achieve cure
of diseases;</li>
        <li>Efforts should be made to obtain 
selfsufficiency in the requirements of antileprosy drugs;</li>
        <li>Activities of voluntary organisations in
leprosy control should be recognised,
supported and dovetailed into the national
programmes;</li>
        <li>Leprosy Act of 1898, which discriminated
against leprosy patients should be
repealed;</li>
        <li>Setting up of National Leprosy
Eradication Commission (NLEC) under
the Chairmanship of Union Minister of
Health and Family Welfare for
programme policy guidance and National
Leprosy Board (NLEB) under the
chairmanship of Union Health Secretary
for monitoring the activities of the
programme.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tuberculosis</i></strong></div>

In India today, two deaths occur every three
minutes from tuberculosis (TB). But these deaths
can be prevented. With proper care and
treatment, TB patients can be cured and the
battle against TB can be won. Tuberculosis has
taken the form of an epidemic in India and
remains the leading infectious cause of death in
the country, killing close to 500,000 people each
year. The country also has about 2 million new
cases of TB each year, far more than any other
country, and accounts for nearly one-third of the
global burden of TB.
<br>
<br>
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease
caused by a bacterium, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis. It is spread through the air by a
person suffering from TB. A single patient can
infect 10 or more people in a year.
India has a long and distinguished tradition
of research in TB. Studies from the Tuberculosis
Research Centre in Chennai and the National
Tuberculosis Institute in Bangalore provided key
knowledge to improve treatment of TB patients
all around the world.
What is more frightening, the incidence of
multi-drug resistant TB has been rising rapidly,
underscoring an urgent need to take remedial
measures. There are two reasons why TB has
assumed alarming proportion. First it has been
seen that treatment in most cases has been
irregular and inadequate due to variety of
reasons, poverty being the single most important
one. People do not pursue the long-drawn
treatment schedule and relapses are quite
common.
<br>
<br>
Second, there are lots of quacks in this field
and the government's direction is completely
lacking. Also, since Tuberculosis is a micro
bacterial droplet infection, it is quite common
among the lower strata of the society where
proper hygiene levels are not maintained. It is
also quite prevalent at places which are
overcrowded and over populated like
J.J. Clusters.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course
(DOTS)</i></strong></div>

The DOTS strategy along with the other
components of the Stop TB strategy,
implemented under the Revised National
Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) in
India, is a comprehensive package for TB control.
The DOTS strategy is cost-effective and is today
the international standard for TB control
programmes. To date, more than 180 countries
are implementing the DOTS strategy. India has
adapted and tested the DOTS strategy in various
parts of the country since 1993, with excellent
results, and by March 2006 nationwide DOTS
coverage has been achieved.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Multi-drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB)</i></strong></div>

MDRTB refers to strains of the bacterium
which are proven in a laboratory to be resistant
to the two most active anti-TB drugs, isoniazid
and rifampicin. Treatment of MDRTB is
extremely expensive, toxic, arduous, and often
unsuccessful. DOTS has been proven to prevent
the emergence of MDRTB, and also to reverse
the incidence of MDRTB where it has emerged.
MDRTB is a tragedy for individual patients and
a symptom of poor TB management. The best
way to confront this challenge is to improve TB
treatment and implement DOTS.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Second Phase of RNTCP</i></strong></div>

In the first phase of RNTCP (1998-2005), the
programme's focus was on ensuring expansion
of quality DOTS services to the entire country.
There are many challenges remaining that are
to be addressed in order to achieve the TB-related
targets set by the Millennium Development Goals
for 2015 and to achieve TB control in the longer
term.
<br>
<br>
The RNTCP has now entered its second
phase in which the programme aims to firstly
consolidate the gains made to date, to widen
services both in terms of activities and access,
and to sustain the achievements for decades to
come in order to achieve ultimate objective of
TB control in the country.
<br>
<br>
All components of new Stop TB Strategy
are incorporated in the second phase of RNTCP.
These are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Pursue quality DOTS expansion and
enhancement, by improving the case
finding are cure through an effective
patient-centred approach to reach all
patients, especially the poor.</li>
        <li>Address TB-HIV, MDR-TB and other
challenges, by scaling up TB-HIV joint
activities, DOTS Plus, and other relevant
approaches.</li>
        <li>Contribute to health system
strengthening, by collaborating with other
health programmes and general services.</li>
        <li>Involve all health care providers, public,
non-governmental and private, by scaling
up approaches based on a public-private
mix (PPM), to ensure adherence to the
International Standards of TB care.</li>
        <li>Engage people with TB, and affected
communities to demand, and contribute
to effective care. This will involve scalingup of community TB care; creating
demand thorugh context-specific
advocacy, communication and social
mobilization.</li>
        <li>Enable and promote research for the
development of new drugs, diagnostic and
vaccines. Operational Research will also
be needed to improve programme
performance.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Blindness</i></strong></div>

India has the largest blind and potentially
blind population in the world. Cataract, which
is curable, is the major cause (nearly 80 per cent),
followed by trachoma, smallpox, malnutrition,
vitamin A deficiency, injuries and glaucoma. 85
per cent of blindness is either preventable or
curable.
<br>
<br>
<b>National Programme for Control of Blindness
(NPCB)</b> was launched in 1975-76 which
incorporated the earlier Trachoma Control
Programme started in 1963. This was 100 percent Centrally sponsored scheme with the goal
to reduce the prevalence of blindness from 1.4
per cent to 0.3 per cent. As per Survey in 2001-
02, prevalence of blindness was estimated to be
1.1 per cent. Target for the 10th Plan was to
reduce prevalence of blindness to 0.8 per cent
by 2007 prevalence of Blindness was 1 per cent
(2006-07 Survey).
The approach under the UPCB consists of
intensive health education for eye care through
the mass media and extension education
methods; extension of ophthalmic services in the
rural areas through mobile units and eye camps
and establishment of permanent infrastructure
for eye health care as an integral part of general
health services. Since 1981-82, cataract
operations have been accorded high priority in
the programme and targets for different States/
UTs have been set.
<br>
<br>
The concept of District Blindness Control
Societies (DBCS) has been successfully
implemented under the programme. The
programme is receiving assistance from Danish
International Development Agency (DANIDA).
A project has been approved under the World
Bank to boost up the activities of the programme
in seven major States- Andhra Pradesh, Madhya
Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Orissa,
Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.
The objectives of the NPCB are: -
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To reduce the backlog of blindness
through identification and treatment of
blind.</li>
        <li>To develop Eye Care facilities in every
district.</li>
        <li>To develop human resources for providing
Eye Care Services.</li>
        <li>To improve quality of service delivery.</li>
        <li>To secure participation of Voluntary
Organizations in eye care.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Goitre Control</i></strong></div>

Iodine is required for the synthesis of the
thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and
triiodothyronine (T3) and essential for the normal
growth and development and well being of all
humans. It is a micronutrient and normally
require around 100-150 microgram for normal
growth and development. Deficiency of iodine
may cause following disorders: Goitre,
Subnormal intelligence, Neuromuscular
weakness, Endemic cretinism, Still birth,
Hypothyroidism, Defect in vision, hearing, and
speech, Spasticity, Intrauterine death, Mental
retardation.
<br>
<br>
Endemic goitre has been recognised as an
age-old health problem in the Himalayan belt
with recent extensive studies. It is now
established that about 17 crore people in the
country are exposed to Iodine-deficiency
disorders. Out of which, it is estimated that
about 4.5 crore people are suffering from some
of the manifestation of these disorders. National
Goitre Control Programme (1962) is being
implemented on a priority basis. The
Government of India has decided to iodise the
entire edible salt in the country in a phased
manner with a view of ensuring proper
monitoring and effective implementation of the
National Goitre Control Programme. State/
Union Territories have been advised to establish
a goitre cell.
In recent years, it has become increasingly
clear that iodine deficiency leads not only to
goitre, but also to other Iodine Deficiency
Disorders (IDD) like still births, cretinism, 
neonatal hypothyroidism, juvenile hypothyroidism,
impaired hearing and brain development and
function. Recognising the widespread IDD in
India, the Government has redesignated NGCP
as National Iodine Deficiency Disorders Control
Programme (NIDDCP). Iodine deficiency has
been identified all over the world. It is a
significant health problem in 130 countries and
affects 740 million people. One third of the world
population is exposed to the risk of IDD.
It is estimated that in India alone, more than
6.1 crore people are suffering from endemic goitre
and 88 lakh people have mental/ motor
handicaps. A national level survey has been
carried out in 25 states and 5 union territories in
the country and found that out of 282 districts
surveyed, in 241 districts it is a major public
health problem where the prevalence rate is more
than 10%. It is estimated that more than 71
million persons are suffering from goitre and
other iodine deficiency disorders like mental
retardation, deaf mutism, squint, and
neuromotor defects.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Programme</i></strong></div>

Following the successful trial of iodised salt
in Kangara valley, Himachal Pradesh in 1962,
India has launched a 100 per cent centrally
sponsored National Goitre Control Programme.
In 1992, the National Goitre Control Programme
(NGCP) was renamed as National Iodine
Deficiency Disorder Control Programme
(NIDDCP).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Objectives</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Initial survey to identify magnitude of
problem in the country;</li>
        <li>Production and supply of iodized salt to
the endemic regions;</li>
        <li>Health Education & Publicity;</li>
        <li>To undertake monitoring of the quality of

controlled as desired.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Anthrax</i></strong></div>

Anthrax is primarily an infectious bacterial
disease of animals, particularly herbivores such
as cattle, sheep, horses, mules and goats where
this disease was known to cause uncontrolled
mortality at one time. These animals usually get
infected by ingestion of the anthrax spores while
grazing on contaminated soil and drinking water
contaminated with anthrax spores. Human
beings invariably contract anthrax by direct or
indirect contact with diseased animals; handling
infected animal products like flesh, bones, hides
and hair, eating infected meat and of course, by
breathing weaponized anthrax spores.
The severity of anthrax infection in human
beings depends upon many factors such as the
route of infection, nutritional status of the host
and also the virulence of the infected strain.
Three types of anthrax occurs in human beingscutaneous anthrax acquired through a skin
lesion, gastrointestinal anthrax contracted
through ingestion of contaminated meat of
infected animals or drinking water containing
anthrax spores and lastly, pulmonary or
inhalation anthrax caused by breathing in of air
borne spores.
<br>
<br>
<b>Symptoms:</b> In the first few days of infection,
the patient develops influenza-like symptoms
with fever and mild pain in chest. As it gains a
firm foothold in the host body, there occurs a
massive release of bacterial toxins which causes
the lymph nodes to break down and bleed, thus
spreading the infection in the chest. Infected
fluids slowly build up in the lungs causing
difficult breathing and high fever. Death occurs
due to toxin- induced shock. Control measures
for breaking the cycle of anthrax infection
include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Quick disposal of anthrax carcasses.</li>
        <li>Disinfection, decontamination and
disposal of all contaminated materials.</li>
        <li>Vaccination of exposed susceptible
animals and humans involved in at risk
occupations.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Anthrax bacterium genome sequenced:</i></strong></div>

TIGR (The Institute for Genomic Research)
deciphered the genome of an isolate of the socalled “Ames strain of Bacillus anthracis.
Scientists say they have found potential new
targets for drugs and vaccines against the
anthrax germ by deciphering and analyzing the
bacterium’s complete genetic makeup.
Researchers identified several genes that might
play key roles in anthrax infections. Such genes
might prove to be good leads for developing new
treatments. The effort is crucial for anthrax,
which can be lethal, as it is a potential weapon
of future terrorism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hepatitis-C</i></strong></div>

Although the world is full of nasty viruses,
the Hepatitis-C virus is particularly trickier.
Medical science recognised decades ago that not
all cases of hepatitis were caused by the two
viruses (A and B) that have already been
identified. But Hepatitis-C virus (HCV), which
is spread mainly by contaminated blood from
shared syringes, was not isolated and identified
until 1989.
HCV is believed to have infected some 170
million people and another 3 million join their
ranks every year. In most cases it settles down
to form a chronic infection of the liver which,
over the course of several decades, can lead to
severe forms of liver damage such as cirrhosis
and fibrosis, as well as cancer.
<br>
<br>
According to the World Health Organisation,
Hepatitis-C kills around 500,000 people a year.
It is less deadly than AIDS, which claims more
than 3 million lives annually. However its higher
prevalence (at the moment, some 42 m people
are infected with HIV), longer incubation period
and the absence of effective drugs, mean that it
is potentially a more lethal epidemic. Considering
the severity of this nasty virus immediate steps
are needed to tackle it. German scientists have
shown that a molecule code named BILN 2061
can block the activity, both in the test tube and
in experimental animals, of an HCV protein
called NS 3 protease, without which the virus
cannot go about its business. More significantly,
the drug also seems to work in people. Although
this is a significant success, we have to go a long
way to achieve the final therapy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>West Nile</i></strong></div>

West Nile virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne
zoonotic arbovirus belonging to the genus
Flavivirus. This flavivirus is found in temperate
and tropical regions of the world. It was first
identified in the West Nile subregion in the East
African nation of Uganda in 1937. Prior to the
mid-1990s, WNV disease occurred only
sporadically and was considered a minor risk
for humans, until an outbreak in Algeria in 1994,
with cases of WNV-caused encephalitis, and the
first large outbreak in Romania in 1996, with a
high number of cases with neuroinvasive disease.
WNV has now spread globally.
<br>
<br>
West Nile is one of the emerging infectious
diseases. West Nile virus is spread to people by
mosquitoes, usually producing mild, flu-like
symptoms but can cause a deadly encephalitis
or inflammation of the brain. The virus was first
detected in the United States. Since then, it has
spread rapidly from the northeastern United
States throughout North America; this year it
has again made havoc, claiming 10 lives and
making over 500 sick.
The US researchers have created a promising
vaccine against West Nile virus by replacing part
of a distantly related virus with proteins from
the West Nile virus, creating a hybrid virus
vaccine. It protects monkeys from West Nile virus
and human chemical trials of the vaccine are
expected to begin soon. This vaccine will provide
long term immunity to West Nile virus.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED
DISEASE CONTROL</i></strong></div>

Sexually-transmitted diseases (S.T.D.) like
syphilis and gonorrhoea are fairly widespread
in India. For the management and control of
STD, the Government initiated a centrally -aided
National Control Programme on STD during the
Second Five year plan.
S.T.D. was introduced as a National Control
Programme during the Second Five year Plan
by the Government of India. The Programme
was then primarily a Centrally- aided scheme
concerned mainly with: (i) establishing S.T.D.
clinics throughout the country; (ii) supply of
drugs to the earlier existing and newly
established clinics; and (iii) conducting training
courses for the in-service medical and paramedical personnel.
The scheme was, however, converted into a
Centrally- sponsored scheme during the Fourth
Five year Plan and the Central government
assistance was limited to (i) giving grants-in-aid
to States for establishing new STD clinics, and
(ii) supplying drugs (Benzathine, Penicillin) to
the STD clinics for the in-service medical and
paramedical personnel.
<br>
<br>
Recognising STD as one of the major factors
for transmission of HIV infection, the programme
has been merged with the AIDS Control
Programme. The existing components of the
programme, viz. teaching, training, and research
however, has been retained outside the World
Bank assisted activities of the National AIDS
Control Programme.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AIDS Programme</i></strong></div>

HIV infection in the country has been
reported from as many as 23 States/UTs, and of
these Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and
Manipur have the highest incidence. In
Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, the pattern of
HIV infection is that of sub-Saharan type, i.e.,
through sexual transmission. In the North
Eastern States, the pattern of HIV infection
follows a course similar to that of Southern
Europe and Thailand, i.e., through drug abuse.
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has
set up a National AIDS Control Organisation as
a separate wing within the Ministry to
implement and closely monitor the various
components of the programme as documented
in the Staff Appraisal Report of I.D.A. (World
Bank). The ultimate objective of the project
would be to arrest the pace of HIV infection in
the country with a view to reducing the future
morbidity, mortality and impact of AIDS.
The Project would consist of the following
components:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Strengthening Programme Management Capabilities: National AIDS
Control Organisation would primarily
be involved in planning, consulting,
implementing and monitoring the
various activities under the project
through the AIDS Control Cell at the
State/UT level.</li>
        <li>Strengthening of IEC : The project
would seek to carry out an intensive
public awareness and community
support campaign through mass media
and sustained dissemination of
information and health education about
HIV and AIDS to all levels and
categories of personnel.</li>
        <li>Prevention of Transmission through
Blood and Blood Products: The project
seeks to upgrade the blood banking
capabilities in the public sector and
expansion of HIV screening of all blood
used for transfusion and blood-products
in the country.</li>
        <li>Strengthening Clinical Management
capabilities: The project seeks to
strengthen the institutional capabilities
at the State/UT level for monitoring the
development of HIV and AIDS epidemic
and planning and programming
interventions to control such epidemics.</li>
        <li>Controlling S.T.D.: One of the
predominant mode of transmission of
HIV infection is through sexual contact.
The project seeks to take up activities to
strengthen the clinical services and case
management activities in STD centres.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>The Disease:</b> It is the late stage of infection
with the Human Immuno Deficiency Virus
(HIV). The Virus is of course much older and it
is believed that it originated in Africa. This was
first identified by chemical medicine in the
United States and it was only in 1981 that the
world was alerted to what has become a global
scourge rivaling the medieval plague.
AIDS can take around 7-10 years to develop
after infection with HIV. The AIDS virus causes
a weakness of the immune system. It attacks the
cells responsible for maintaining our immuno
response called lymphocyte. When it infects the
body, it prefers to cells of our defence system.
These cells are called helper T cells which are a
fundamental part of our immune system. The
AIDS virus almost fully specialises on these white
blood cells since these helper T cells have CD 4
molecules on the surface to which the AIDS
virus binds.
<br>
<br>
To put it simply, the AIDS virus consists of
genetic information on the inside and a
protective outer shell of proteins and
glycoproteins. Since viruses use the host cell's
resources for reproduction, they do not need to
contribute much of itself. That is why they are
much smaller than the host cells, e.g. helper T
cells. In the host cell's nucleus, there is more than
100,000 times as much genetic information
stored than under the protein shell of the AIDS
virus. However, there is no way to stop the virus
once the cell has been infected.
AIDS now kills about three lakh Indian adults
each year. This is roughly 15 times the number
of people killed in the Gujarat earthquake. It was
first noticed in 1986 when six sex workers of
Chennai were found infected with HIV. Since
then some 20 lakh to 25 lakh Indians have died
of AIDS.
<br>
<br>
The 2006 estimates suggest national adult
HIV prevalence in India is approximately 0.36
per cent, amounting to between 2 and 3.1 million
people. If an average figure is taken, this comes
to 2.5 million people living with HIV and AIDS;
almost 50 percent of the previous estimate of 5.2
million.
More men are HIV positive than women.
Nationally, the prevalence rate for adult females
is 0.29 per cent, while for males it is 0.43 per
cent. This means that for every 100 people living
with HIV and AIDS (PLHAs), 61 are men and
39 women. Prevalence is also high in the 15-49
age group (88.7 percent of all infections),
indicating that AIDS still threatens the cream of
society, those in the prime of their working life.
AIDS is the record largest killer of Indian
adults; second only to T.B. Heterosexual contact
is the most prevalent mode of transmission here
in which infected males have the largest
contribution (90 per cent). Infection through
blood and blood products account for 7 per cent
only of the total AIDS cases, 89 per cent are in
the age group of 15-44 years. About 70 per cent
infections are reported to be among men and 85
per cent transmission are through multipartner
sex- both among high risk group and general
population.
<br>
<br>
If the rapid rate continues, AIDS- caused
deaths will outstrip TB very soon. At a minimum,
between 40 lakh to 50 lakh Indians are currently
infected, not including the 20 lakhs to 25 lakhs
who have already died. Another five lakh Indian
adults are getting infected every year- one new
adult every minute!
Three states- Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh
and Karnataka- are in the midst of full-blown
epidemic, with well over two per cent of all
adults infected. Another three states follow just
behind- Tamil Nadu, Manipur and Nagaland.
In about eight to ten urban areas of these six
states, three to five per cent of adults are infected.
These include such major cities as Pune,
Kolhapur and Hyderabad. These are among the
most severely affected areas outside Africa, on
par with Thailand, which has been battling a
severe epidemic for a decade. And every year,
the number of states with worsening epidemics
swells- Kerala just crossed the one per cent
infection level against adults, and even remote
Orissa is nearly there.
It is not just the poor who are contracting
HIV. For proof, look at the members of the
Positive People's Group that are mushrooming
in every major urban area, from Delhi to
Bangalore to Vajayawada- they are middle and
upper income, not blue- collar, not poor.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>How to check the pandemic</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>India will not be able to avert an epidemic
unless our politicians, bureaucrats and
journalists immediately end their knee-jerk
response to AIDS. An essential first step
is to end our foolish denial that our society
is somehow impervious to AIDS, which it
cannot go the way of Africa.</li>
        <li>We then need to insist that our health
care system is improved, right-away. The
Government simply has to find the money
and commitment to ensure that every
Indian has access to decent health
services, including prevention and care for
sexually transmitted diseases and T.B.
HIV/AIDS cannot be fought where health
services barely exits.</li>
        <li><b>National AIDS Control Organisation
(NACO)</b> be run in a committed,
transparent and participatory fashion,
serving the needs of all Indians, not as
the high-handed, secretive, stonewalling
bureaucracy.</li>
        <li>Our efforts should be dedicated to
ensuring that no more Indians get infected,
and that no more die because they cannot
afford treatment with anti- retroviral and
other medicines. All Indians should
mandatorily be given comprehensive sex
education that will dispel the confusion
about HIV/AIDS and enable them to
protect themselves. In addition, young
people everywhere must have regular face
to face counselling on safe sex.</li>
        <li>Laws and policies should also be changed
to empower and protect people already
infected or those especially from vulnerable
groups.</li>
        <li>Discrimination in the private sector
against infected people must be made
illegal.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MENTAL HEALTH</i></strong></div>

The government of India decided to launch
the National Mental Health Programme (NMHP)
during the 7th Five year Plan period in 1982 to
ensure availability and accessibility of minimum
mental health care for all in the foreseeable
future, particularly to the most vulnerable and
under-privileged sections of the population, to
encourage application of mental health
knowledge in general health care and social
development, and to promote community

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Alzheimer's disease</i></strong></div>
            
Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive,
degenerative disease that attacks the brain and
results in impaired memory, thinking and
behaviour. It is the most common form of
primary dementia. It afflicts 1 in 10 people over
age 65 and nearly half of all people aged 85 and
over. It has been estimated that more than
1,00,000 die of Alzheimer’s disease annually,
which makes it the fourth leading cause of death
in adults, after heart disease, cancer and stroke.
<br>
<b>Common Symptoms:</b> Memory loss,
Difficulty performing familiar tasks, problems
with language, Disorientation to time and place,
Poor or decreased judgment, Problems with
abstract thinking, Misplacing things, changes in
mood or behaviour, changes in personality, loss
of initiative, etc.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Epilepsy</i></strong></div>
            
Epilepsy is the most common of many severe
neurological disorders. But in contrast to other
chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart
disease, epilepsy carries a heavy burden of stigma
that is a major obstacle to its treatment.
According to WHO, an estimated 39 million
people in the world suffer from epilepsy, but
some 39 million of them- almost three out of
every four get little help for the condition. In
developing countries, 60-90 per cent of people
with epilepsy are excluded from treatment.
There is thus a huge treatment gap where
epilepsy is concerned. To combat epilepsy,
education of health workers, patients, and the
wider community is essential.
<br>
<br>
Cantab-paired Associate Learning (Cantabpal) test: This test was invented by Dr. Barbara
Sahakian and Professor Trevor Robbins which
detects Alzheimer’s disease with 98 per cent
accuracy. It distinguishes Alzheimer’s sufferers
from patients with depression and people
without any neuropsychiatric disorder.
Cantab-pal works by flashing patterns and
images on the computer screen. Patients have to
identify where the image first appeared.
According to Dr. Sahakian, Cantab will be,
useful not only for early detection of Alzheimer's
disease but could also be used to measure the
beneficial effects of current pharmacy ecological
treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors, as
well as future drugs, including neuroprotective
agents.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The test's sensitivity to Alzheimer's disease
is related to the fact that the areas in the brain
first affected are those utilized when performing
the test.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SARS AND BIRD FLU</i></strong></div>

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
was recognized at the end of February 2003.
Emerging and re-emerging epidemic diseases
pose an on-going threat to global health security.
According to Klaus Stohr, a virologist for the
WHO, there is nearly conclusive evidence to
implicate a type called a coronavirus for SARS.
Coronavirus belongs to a family of viruses that
can cause among other things, the common cold
in humans.
<br>
<br>
The WHO Specialist's conclusion is based on
the fact that out of 55 SARS patients tested, 45
either had the virus in their faeces, or had
antibodies to it in their body fluids. The virus
has, moreover, been isolated from patients during
all stages of the disease.
It is still not clear where the virus first came
from but genetic work suggests it is related to
mouse hepatitis C, transmissible gastroenteritis
in Pigs, and the human coronavirus. Such links
add force to the theory that the disease originated
in livestock in rural China, where humans and
animals live in close contact, and then jumped
to humans.
Initially, the epidemiologists believed that the
virus spread by the transmission of droplets, that
is, through coughing and sneezing. But some
cases caused particular alarm because they do
not appear to follow a droplet pattern of
infection, so new routes of transmission, via air
and water, are being examined.
Without knowing the precise transmission
routes, it is difficult to contain a disease. As a
precautionary step, WHO recommended that all
but essential travel to Hong Kong and
Guangdong should be postponed. Fortunately,
after WHO's alert, health authorities were
primed to isolate these cases, and they were able
to prevent any subsequent spread. The alert,
though, came just too late to prevent an
outbreak in Canada.
<br>
<br>
At the moment only time and labourintensive laboratory testing can determine if
someone is infected with the disease.
American Scientists at the Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), after identifying
the new coronavirus, proposed that the virus
should be named after a doctor, Carlo Urbani,
who first identified the disease and then became
a victim. Dr Urbani succumbed to the disease
later.
After SARS the world has once been rocked
by another pandemic avian havoc. Major
affected areas were South-East Asia. Mass culling
of birds was also undertaken in South Korea,
Vietnam, Japan, Taiwan, China and Pakistan.
The disease is caused by the H5N1 avian
influenza virus. The World Health Organization
(WHO) confirmed that the fatal infection had
caused some deaths.
Bird flu or AF is a form of influenza that
strikes all birds. The domestic poultry are
particularly more prone to it. This is an acute
infectious disease of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract caused by a strain of influenza
virus A. The Type A influenza virus spreads to
human beings and other animals through
contaminated nasal respiratory and faecal
material from infected birds. Bird flue symptoms
in humans are fever, cough, sore throat and
muscle aches. Other symptoms include eye
infection, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress,
viral pneumonia and kidney failure. The latest
AF outbreak was particularly alarming from the
perspective of human health because the
causative agent for most of these outbreaks was
a highly pathogenic strain, (H5N1) which is
deadly to poultry, particularly chickens. Birds
that survive infection shed the virus for at least
10 days, orally and through faeces, thus
facilitating its spread. H5N1 also has the unique
capacity to jump the species barrier. The virus,
which was first isolated from terns in South
Africa in 1961, mutates rapidly and has the
propensity to acquire genes from influenza
viruses, affecting other animal species.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FOOD ADULTERATION</i></strong></div>

The Prevention of Food Adulteration Act,
1954, has been in force since June, 1985, with
the objective of ensuring that food articles sold
to consumers are pure and wholesome. It also
aims at preventing fraud or deception and
encouraging fair trade practices. A minimum
imprisonment of six months with a minimum
fine of Rs. 1,000 is envisaged under the Act for
cases of proven adulteration whereas for the
cases of adulteration which may render the food
injurious to cause death or such harm which
may amount to grievous hurt, the punishment
may go up to life imprisonment and a fine which
shall not be less then Rs. 5,000.
The administration of the Act and the
provisions thereunder is the primary
responsibility of state government and union
territory administration. The Central
government lays down broad policies in this
regard, carries out the necessary amendments
to the Act and rules and advises state
governments and union territory administrations
in the effective implementation of the
programme. For advising the Centre or the states
with regard to implementation of the Act, there
is a statutory body, namely, Central Committee
for Food Standards. The Committee is assisted
by various technical sub-committees. The Act is,
by and large, implemented by local bodies.
There are four central food laboratories viz.
Central Food Laboratory at Central Food
Technological Research Institute (CFTRI),
Mysore; Central Food Laboratory at Food
Research and Standardisation Laboratory,
Ghaziabad; Central Food Laboratory at State
Public Health Laboratory Pune and Central Food
Laboratory, Kolkata. Samples are sent to these
appellate laboratories by courts. Statements of
facts contained in the report given by the
laboratories are considered to be the final and
conclusive evidence.
<br>
<br>
<b>Food Safety and Standards Authority of
India (FSSAI)</b> had notified Rules on 5th August
2011 under FSSA Act 2006 to give guidelines to
food industry for hygiene and regulations/
standards for safe and wholesome food for
human consumption.
<br>
<br>
A nationwide project, Food and Drug
Capacity Building Project was designed to
improve the quality and safety of food and drugs
by strengthening the regulatory framework and
incorporating components of consumer
education with the assistance of World Bank. The
project remained in operation from 2003 to 2008
to improve the capacity of laboratories at central
and state levels along with other regulatory
programme. For this purpose the government of
India took nearly Rs.320 crore soft loans from
World Bank.
<br>
<br>
There are 76 food laboratories under the
control of state government/local bodies. The
samples lifted by food inspectors are sent to these
laboratories and on the basis of the reports,
prosecutions are launched in courts.
Under joint FAO/WHO Food Standards
Programme, Codex Alimentarius Commission
has been established to formulate worldwide
standards for food. India is also a member of this
body. A National Codex Committee has been set
up under the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare to formulate the Indian viewpoint on
various matters concerning International Food
Standards Programme.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEW INVENTIONS IN THE FIELD OF MEDICINES</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nuclear Medicine</i></strong></div>    
        
In the peaceful use of nuclear science,
nuclear medicine has a prominent place. The
alpha, beta and gamma radiations from
radioactive nucleus have revealed their curative
power. Today, Radio-isotopes have become
invaluable tools to solve many complex diseases.
Though the use of Radio-isotopes to cure
diseases goes back to 1938, its full development
took place in the 70s. Nuclear medicine uses the
tracer principle which was evolved by George
Hevesy for which he got the Nobel prize in 1944.
Today, the Positron Emission Tomography has
revolutionised the field of nuclear medicine. The
main Radio-isotopes used in nuclear medicine
include Cobalt-60, Iridium-192, Gold-199,
Oxygen -15, Nitrogen-13, Carbon-11, Fluorine18, Rubidium-82, Copper-62, Gallium-68, etc.
They are used not only for curative purpose, but
also for scanning the body. Cabolt-60, Iridium192, and Gold-199 have been used to cure
cancer. Iodine-131 is being used to cure thyroid
disorders.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chronotherapy</i></strong></div>    
        
Chronotherapy is relatively a new field in
bio-medical science in which delivering the right
therapy at the right time to optimize medical
treatment and to reduce the side effects of the
medicine. With this aim, chronologists are
working to understand the mysteries of the
human biological clock (circadian rhythm) and
are producing substantial evidence of how
synchronizing treatment of chronotherapy
(timing treatment according to body's natural
rhythm) may make surgery, radiation and drug
therapy more effective, significantly reducing
side effects and even prolonging life.</li>
        <li> Blood disease with GM stem cells
Two major-technical obstacles that currently
limit the success of gene therapy for human red
blood cell diseases such as beta-thalassemia and
sickle cell disease have been overcome by
researchers at the St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital.
<br>
<br>
The team overcame the obstacle passed by
the large number of defective hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) producing faulty red blood cells in
beta-thalassemia or sickle cell disease. The large
numbers of defective HSCs thwart attempts by
gene therapy to reverse the disease. HSCs are
parent cells in the bone marrow that give rise to
blood cells. The researchers also performed the
difficult task of integrating genes into an HSCs
own DNA so the HSCs function normally.
The results offer promise for developing gene
therapy to treat blood diseases in humans caused
by defective haemoglobin i.e. haemoglobin that
either lacks a critical protein called beta globin
or that contains a mutated form of the protein.
Haemoglobin is the oxygen carrying protein
in red blood cells. Replacing red blood cells that
carry defective haemoglobin with red cells that
carry defective haemoglobin with red cells that
have normal haemoglobin is a potential strategy
for curing these disorders.
<br>
<br>
Beta thallassemia (Cooley's anaemia) occurs
when the haemoglobin molecule lacks the betaglobin molecule that is part of the haemoglobin
molecule. In sickle cell disease, an abnormal gene
for beta-globin causes haemoglobin molecules in
the red blood cell to dump together and distort
the cell into the shape of a sickle. Instead of
flowing freely, sickle-shaped red cells sludge and
block blood vessels. This cut off of blood flow
can cause pain, stroke, leg ulcers, bone damage
and other medical problems.
The researchers chose beta-thalassemia and
sickle cells diseases as targets for their gene
therapy study because both diseases could
potentially be treated by modifying HSCs with
normal genes for gamma-globins, which is
usually produced only during foetal life.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>New Technique for Regenerating Organs</i></strong></div>    
        
An Indian doctor has achieved a major
breakthrough by developing a technique for
regeneration of organs and tissue using cells
taken from the patients themselves. The
technique has recently been granted patent by
the U.S. patent and trade mark office. The
technique is expected to revolutionize medical
science as it could do away with organ and
tissue transplants and thus avoid the problems
associated with them. The major advantage of
this new technique is that no donor would be
anymore required to replace diseased organs.
Also, as the new tissues and organs would be
formed within the body using its own cells, there
would be no problem of acceptance of foreign
bodies, which had been a major problem
associated with transplants. In addition, unlike
transplant surgeries, no post operative treatment
by expensive immune suppressant drugs would
be required.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Artificial Hearts</i></strong></div>    
        
A Massachusetts based Abiomed Company
has proposed for production of artificial heart
named Abiocor and Jarvik 2000. The
development of microprocessors bio-goods,
motors and batteries have made the task easy.
The pumping mechanism will be done by motors
and the microprocessors will maintain the blood
flow. The patients using Jarvik 2000 will have to
bear a belt to reactivate the battery. The battery
will be attached to a plug which will provide
energy to the heart through wires. Abiocore uses
a better technique where wires are not needed.
It uses a coil and a battery in the stomach, which
will receive the energy from outer battery by
radio waves. Scientists contemplate it to be a
substitute for ventricle.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FORENSIC TOOLS</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Narco Analysis</i></strong></div>    
        
This is the tool of modern forensics to catch
the culprits and trace the criminals and decipher
their modus operandi by administering
hypnotics or similar drugs into the suspects. In
the Narco Analysis Test, the subject's imagination
is neutralised by making him semi-conscious. In
this state, it becomes difficult for him to lie and
his answers would be restricted to facts he is
already aware of. Experts inject a hypnotic like
Sodium Pentothal or Sodium Amytal and the
subject which is put in a state of Hypnotism is
not in a position to speak up on his own but can
answer specific but simple questions after giving
some suggestions. This test is of great help in
tracing a crime and finding some evidence,
where no primary evidence is available.
Truth serum is a drug used in narco-analysis
that cause a person to become uninhibited and
talkative, but they do not guarantee the veracity
of the subject's statement. People who are under
the influence of truth serums enter a hypnotic
state and speak freely about anxieties or painful
memories. The subject's imagination is
neutralised when semi-conscious, making it
difficult for him/her to lie and his/her answers
would be restricted to facts of which he/she is
aware.
<br>
<br>
<b>Limitation:</b> Such tests generally don’t have
legal validity as confessions made by 
a semiconscious person are not admissible in court. It
states that subjects under a semi-conscious state
do not have the mind set to properly answer any
questions, while some other courts openly accept
them as evidence.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Polygraph</i></strong></div>    
        
A polygraph (commonly known as a lie
detector) is a device that measures and records
several physiological variables such as blood
pressure, heart rate, respiration and skin
conductivity while the subject is asked a series
of questions. The measurements are posited to
be indicators of anxiety that accompanies the
telling of lies. Thus, measured anxiety is equated
with telling untruths. However, if the subject
exhibits anxiety for other reasons, or can control
his anxiety level voluntarily, a measured
response can result in unreliable conclusions. A
polygraph test is also questionably used as a
psycho-physiological detection of deception
(PDD) examination.
<br>
<br>
<b>Limitation:</b> Today, polygraph examiners use
two types of instrumentation, analog and
computerized. While some people believe that
polygraph tests are reliable, there is little scientific
evidence to buttress this claim. For example,
while some claim the test to be accurate in 70%
- 90% of the cases, critics charge that rather than
a “test, the method amounts to an inherently
unstandardizable interrogation technique whose
accuracy cannot be established.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Brain Fingerprinting</i></strong></div>
            
Brain fingerprinting, invented by
Dr. Lawrence Farwell, is a technique that
measures recognition of familiar stimuli by
measuring electrical brain wave responses to
words, phrases, or pictures that are presented
on a computer screen. The theory is that the
suspect's reaction to the details of an event or
activity will reflect if the suspect had prior
knowledge of the event or activity. This test uses
the Memory and Encoding Related Multifaceted
Electroencephalographic Response to detect
familiarity reaction.
<br>
<b>Ethical Consideration:</b> The electrical
potential of the human brain with relation to
specific thoughts and feelings seem to some
people to be highly invasive. However, such
screening procedures might potentially be much
more effective than polygraph screening, which
has never been shown to have prevented an act
of espionage.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TELEMEDICINE</i></strong></div>

Telemedicine involves transfer of medical
information online and in real-time for use in
diagnosis, treatment, and education across
distances. The concept of telemedicine was
introduced more than 30 years ago through the
use of telephone, facsimile machine, and slowscan images. However, the enabling technology
has grown considerably in the past decade. The
term telemedicine, in short refers to the
utilization of telecommunication technology for
medical diagnosis, treatment and patient care.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Areas of Application</i></strong></div>

Telemedicine enables a physician or specialist
at one site to deliver health care, diagnose
patients, give intra-operative assistance, provide
therapy, or consult with another physician or
paramedical personnel at a remote site.
Telemedicine system consists of customized
medical software integrated with computer
hardware, along with medical diagnostic
instruments connected to the commercial VSAT
(Very Small Aperture Terminal) at each location
or fibre optics.
<br>
<br>
Although, telemedicine could potentially
affect all medical specialties, the greatest current
applications are found in radiology, pathology,
cardiology and medical education. Perhaps the
greatest impact of telemedicine may be in
fulfilling its promise to improve the quality,
increase the efficiency, and expand the access
of the healthcare delivery system to the rural
population and developing countries.
Telemedicine finds application in a wide
area. Given below are areas of application and
the advantages accrued thereof.
Specialist consultations between two or
more hospitals: Advantage to patients due to
higher accuracy of diagnosis and treatment.
Leads to shorter hospital stay, faster turnover,
increased availability of hospital beds and
conservation of medical assets.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Opinions on special investigations:</i></strong></div>

Secondary medical centres can send
investigations like ECGs, EEGS, TMTs,
ultrasound/CAT/MRI scans, etc for reporting/
opinions to specialists at tertiary centres. This
would conserve scarce resources, in this case, the
specialists can lead to their better utilization.
Specialist opinions to GPs at small towns
and villages: A ‘Telemed Unit once made
available to a general practitioner (GP) at a
remote site would connect him and hundreds
like him to a Central Specialist Centre (CSC). The
CSC would provide these GPs with 24 hrs 7 days
a week specialist consultancy. This would result
in a good number of patients being treated
locally, though being monitored by specialists,
remotely. Franchising of such units would be a
viable business proposition.
<br>
<br>
<b>Virtual Patient Visits:</b> Relatives can
‘virtually visit their near and dear ones admitted
to hospitals 1000s of miles away with the help
of video conferencing. This would be a
tremendous psychological boost for the patient
and could speed up his recovery.
<br>
<br>
<b>Medical Tourism:</b> It is the Buzz word in
corporate hospitals today. Patients from far off
countries can avail of superb, immediate
treatment at less then half to one sixth the cost
that they would have paid in their own country.
<br>
<br>
<b>Chronic patients monitored from home:</b>
Chronic patients can be monitored from home
regularly by remote consultations, cutting down
on trips to distant hospitals. This methodology
applies well to certain cardiovascular,
respiratory, diabetic, renal, psychiatric and
dermatological cases.
<br>
<br>
<b>Treatment of patients in inaccessible
areas:</b> Patients in inaccessible areas like
mountains, ships at seas, islands when cut off
due to weather conditions or natural disasters
can be treated and monitored till they get access
to a hospital.
<br>
<br>
<b>Treatment of casualties in disaster areas:</b>
Telemedicine portable units can be setup at
disaster areas in a few hours to assist local
doctors in receiving specialist opinions and
advice for rational evacuation of casualties.
These are just a few of the areas where
telemedicine is utilized today.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

The concept of telemedicine, started about
ten years ago in India on a pilot basis, has
matured onto the next level. Major hospital
groups are now looking at significantly
expanding their centres not just in India but also
in neighbouring countries. The first telemedicine
project in the country was set up by the Apollo
Hospitals group in the village of Aragonda in
Andhra Pradesh in 1999. Apollo Hospitals,
which now has close to 150 centres in India,
Bangladesh, Maldives, Sri Lanka and
Kazakhstan, is targeting to have 500-700
locations in the next 18-24 months.
ISRO’s Network: ISRO’s satellite based
Telemedicine network, which started in 2001 on
an experimental basis, was aimed at linking
remote/rural district hospitals with superspecialty hospitals in major cities via INSAT.
While ISRO provides software, hardware and
communication equipment as well as satellite
bandwidth, the specialty hospitals provide
infrastructure, manpower and maintain the
system. There are currently estimated 350-400
hospitals connected by telemedicine. On the
ISRO network alone, there are 170, of which
around 35 are specialty hospitals and the rest
remote centres.
<br>
<br>
ISRO's Telemedicine network further
expanded with the signing of MOU on May 16,
2006 with four specialty hospitals - Manipal
Hospital, Bangalore; Sir Ganga Ram Hospital,
New Delhi; Madras Diabetic Research
Foundation, Chennai and Dr Venkatrao Dawle
Medical Foundation, Ambajogai (Maharashtra).
ISRO's telemedicine programme is an
example of societal orientation of Indian space
programme and with several private specialty
hospitals besides state governments and NGOs
showing keen interest in establishing the
telemedicine network, augurs well to the cause
of extending quality healthcare to the rural
population. Efforts are also being made by ISRO
to include telemedicine through Village Resource
Centres (VRC) which are being set up in
association with NGOs, trusts and state and
central agencies.
<br>
<br>
Providing healthcare to India’s over one
billion population of which about 75 per cent
live in villages, is a formidable task. About 75
per cent of the doctors practice in urban areas
and 23 per cent in semi-urban areas. This leaves
just 2 per cent of the qualified doctors, who are
attached to about 23,000 primary health and
3000 community health centres, to attend to 70
per cent of the population living in villages.
Telemedicine initiatives at ISRO have been
broadly divided into the following areas:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing Telemedicine Technology &
connectivity between remote/rural
hospital and Super Speciality Hospital
for Teleconsultation, Treatment &
Training of doctors & paramedics.</li>
        <li>Providing the Technology & connectivity
for Continuing Medical Education
(CME) between Medical Colleges & Post
Graduate Medical Institutions/
Hospitals.</li>
        <li>Providing Technology & connectivity for
Mobile Telemedicine units for rural
health camps especially in the areas of
ophthalmology and community health.</li>
        <li>Providing technology and connectivity
for Disaster Management Support and
Relief.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

As telemedicine technologies and processes
gradually mature, the extent of medical
specialties where telemedicine technologies could
prove clinically useful should expand. Indeed,
reports of telemedicine implementation are
appearing in orthopaedics, dermatology,
psychiatry, oncology, neurology, pediatrics,
internal medicine, ophthalmology and surgery.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH MISSION</i></strong></div>

Recognizing the importance of Health in the
process of economic and social development and
improving the quality of life of our citizens, the
Government of India has launched the National
Rural Health Mission to carry out necessary
architectural correction in the basic health care
delivery system.
The Mission adopts a synergistic approach
by relating health to determinants of good health
viz. segments of nutrition, sanitation, hygiene
and safe drinking water. It also aims at
mainstreaming the Indian systems of medicine
to facilitate health care.
<br>
<br>
National Rural Health Mission was launched
on 12th April, 2005 with an objective to provide
effective healthcare to the rural population, the
disadvantaged groups, including women and
children by improving access, enabling
community ownership, strengthening public
health systems for efficient service delivery,
enhancing equity and accountability and
promoting decentralization.
The scheme proposes a number of new
mechanisms for healthcare delivery, including
training local residents as Accredited Social
Health Activists (ASHA) and the Janani
Surakshay Yojana (motherhood protection
programme). It also aims at improving hygiene
and sanitation infrastructure. It is the most
ambitious rural health initiative ever.
The mission has a special focus on 18 states
Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar,
Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand,

care, through a revamped primary public health
care system, targeted outreach services and
involvement of the community and urban local
bodies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL HEALTH POLICY 2002</i></strong></div>

The National Health Policy-2002 (NHP-2002)
was cleared by the Union Cabinet in May 2002.
This is the second such policy adopted by the
Government after a gap of 19 years. The National
Health Policy-2002 gave prime importance to
ensure a more equitable access to health services
across the social and geographical expanse of
the country. It calls for a strong primary health
network in rural India. Emphasis has been given
to increase the aggregate public health
investment through a substantially increased
contribution by the Central Government.
Priority has been given to preventive and
curative initiatives at the primary health level
through increased sectoral share of allocation.
The main objective of this policy is to achieve
an acceptable standard of good health amongst
the general population of the country. The
approach would be to increase access to the
decentralized public health system by
establishing new infrastructure in deficient
areas, and by upgrading the infrastructure in the
existing institutions. The contribution of the
private sector in providing health services would
be much enhanced, particularly for the
population group which can afford to pay for
services. Primacy will be given to preventive and
first-line curative initiatives at the primary health
level through increased sectoral share of
allocation. Emphasis will be laid on rational use
of drugs within the allopathic system.
The policy plannned to increase health sector
expenditure to 6 per cent of GDP, with 2 per
cent of GDP being contributed as public health
investment, by the year 2010. The State
Governments would also need to increase the
commitment to the health sector. In the first
phase, by 2005, they would be expected to
increase the commitment of their resources to 7
per cent of the Budget; and, in the second phase,
by 2010, to increase it to 8 per cent of the Budget.
With the stepping up of the public health
investment, the Central Government's
contribution would rise to 25 per cent from the
existing 15 per cent by 2010.
<br>
<br>
The NHP-2002 sets out an increased
allocation of 55 per cent of the total public health
investment for the primary health sector; the
secondary and tertiary health sectors being
targeted for 35 per cent and 10 per cent
respectively.
Delivery of National Public Health
Programmes: The NHP-2002 envisages the
gradual convergence of all health programmes
under a single field administration. Vertical
programmes for control of major diseases like
TB, Malaria, HIV/AIDS, as also the RCH and
Universal Immunization Programmes, would
need to be continued till moderate success is
achieved.
<br>
<br>
Public Health Infrastructure: The Policy
envisages kick-starting the revival of the Primary
Health System by providing some essential drugs
under Central Government funding through the
decentralized health system.
<br>
<br>
Extending Public Health Services: NHP2002 envisages that in the context of the
availability and spread of allopathic graduates
in their jurisdiction, State Governments should
consider the need for expanding the pool of
medical practitioners; to include a cadre of
licentiates of medical practice and also
practitioners of Indian Systems of Medicine and
Homoeopathy. Simple services/procedures can
be provided by such practitioners even outside
their disciplines, as part of the basic primary
health services in under-served areas.
Role of Local Self-government: NHP-2002
lays great emphasis upon the implementation of
public health programmes through local selfgovernment institutions. The structure of the
national disease control programmes will have
specific components for implementation through
such entities.
<br>
<br>
Use of Generic Drugs and Vaccines: The
2002 policy emphasizes the need for basing
heatment procedure in both the public and
private domain, on a limited number of essential
drugs of a generic nature. This is a pre-requisite
for cost-effective public healthcare. In the public
health system, this would be enforced by
prohibiting the use of proprietary drugs, except
in special circumstances.
<br>
<br>
Urban Health: NHP-2002 envisages the
setting up of an organised urban primary health
care structure. Since the physical features of
urban settings are different from those in rural
areas, the policy envisages the adoption of
appropriate population norms for the urban
public health infrastructure. The structure
conceived under NHP-2002 is a two-tiered one:
the primary centre is seen as the first-tier,
covering a population of one lakh, with a
dispensary providing an OPD facility and
essential drugs, to enable access to all the national
health programmes; and a second-tier of the
urban health organisation at the level of the
Government general hospital, where reference
is made from the primary centre.
<br>
<br>
Mental Health: NHP - 2002 envisages a
network of decentralised mental health services
for ameliorating the more common categories of
disorders. The programme outline for such a
disease would involve the diagnosis of common
disorders, and the prescription of common
therapeutic drugs, by general duty medical staff.
Information, Education and Communication: NHP-2002 envisages an IEC policy,
which maximizes the dissemination of
information to those population groups which
cannot be effectively approached by using only
the mass media. The focus would therefore be
on the inter-personal communication of
information and on folk and other traditional
media to bring about behavioural change.
Health Research: This Policy envisages an
increase in Government-funded health research
to a level of 1 per cent of the total health spending
by 2005; and thereafter, up to 2 per cent by 2010.
Domestic medical research would be focused on
new therapeutic drugs and vaccines for tropical
diseases, such as TB and Malaria, as also on the
sub-types of HIV/AIDS prevalent in the country.
<br>
<br>
National Disease Surveillance Network:
This Policy envisages the full operationalization
of an integrated disease control network from
the lowest rung of public health administration
to the Central Government, by 2005. The
programme for setting up this network will
include components relating to the installation
of data-base handling hardware; IT interconnectivity between different tiers of the
network; and in-house training for data
collection and interpretation for undertaking
timely and effective response.
Health Statistics: The Policy envisages the
completion of baseline estimates for the incidence
of the common diseases - TB, Malaria, and
Blindness - by 2005. The policy also recognizes
the need to establish, in a longer time-frame,
baseline estimates for non-communicable
diseases, like CVD, Cancer, Diabetes; and
accidental injuries, and communicable diseases,
like Hepatitis and JE.
<br>
<br>
Women’s Health: The Policy notes that
women, along with other under-privileged
groups, are significantly handicapped due to a
disproportionately low access to health care. The
various Policy recommendations of NHP-2002,
in regard to the expansion of primary health
sector infrastructure, will facilitate the increased
access of women to basic health care.
<br>
<br>
Medical Ethics: NHP - 2002 envisages that,
in order to ensure that the common patient is
not subjected to irrational or profit-driven
medical regimes, a contemporary code of ethics
be notified and rigorously implemented by the
Medical Council of India.
Environmental and Occupational Health:
This Policy envisages that the independently -
stated policies and programmes of the
environment -related sectors be smoothly
interfaced with the policies and the programmes
of the health sector, in order to reduce the health
risk to the citizens and the consequential disease
burden.
<br>
<br>
Providing medical facilities to users from
overseas: To capitalize on the comparative cost
advantage enjoyed by domestic health facilities
in the secondary and tertiary sectors, NHP-2002
strongly encourages the providing of such health
services on a payment basis to service seekers
from overseas.
<br>
<br>
Impact of globalisation on the health sector:
The Policy takes into account the serious
apprehension, expressed by several health
experts, of the possible threat to health security
in the post-TRIPS era, as a result of a sharp
increase in the prices of drugs and vaccines. To
protect the citizens of the country from such a
threat, this policy envisages a national patent
regime for the future, which, while being
consistent with TRIPS, avails of all opportunities
to secure for the country, under its patent laws,
affordable access to the latest medical and other
therapeutic discoveries. The policy also sets out
that the Government will bring to bear its full
influence in all international fora - UN, WHO,
WTO, etc. - to secure commitments on the part
of the Nations of the Globe, to lighten the
restrictive features of TRIPS in its application to the healthcare sector.
