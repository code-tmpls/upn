<h3>Electronics And Computers</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ELECTRONICS SECTOR IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

India is one of the fastest growing markets
of electronics in the world. There is potential to
develop the Electronics System Design &
Manufacturing (ESDM) sector to meet our
domestic demand as well as to use the capabilities
so created to successfully export ESDM products
from the country.
<br>
<br>
Production of electronic equipment and
components has come a long way since the days
of radio receivers in 1940s. Electronics industry
in India has grown with domestic demand as a
result of import substitution efforts. India
embarked on its Electronics journey around
1965 with an orientation towards space and
defence technologies. This was rigidly controlled
and initiated by the Government. This was
followed by developments in consumer
electronics mainly with Transistor radios, Black
& White TVs, Calculators and other audio
products. Colour Televisions soon followed.
In order to keep pace with developments in
the international scene and also considering the
increasing importance of electronics for
diversified applications, the Department of
Electronics was set up by the Government of
India in 1971. Since then, the department has
been coordinating development of electronics in
India and reviewing constantly the growth
achieved in the industrial front and in the R &
D capabilities.
<br>
<br>
In 1982, which was a significant year in the
history of television in India, the government
allowed thousands of colour TV sets to be
imported into the country to coincide with the
broadcast of Asian Games in New Delhi. 1985
saw the advent of Computers and Telephone
exchanges, which were succeeded by Digital
Exchanges in 1988. The period between 1984
and 1990 was the golden period for electronics
during which the industry witnessed continuous
and rapid growth.
After the software boom in mid 1990s India's
focus shifted to software. Moreover the steep fall
in custom tariffs made the hardware sector
suddenly vulnerable to international
competition. In 1997 the ITA agreement was
signed at the WTO where India committed itself
to total elimination of all customs duties on IT
hardware in the near future.
<br>
<br>
In recent years the electronic industry is
growing rapidly. It is currently worth $75 Billion
but according to estimates, has the potential to
reach $ 400 billion by 2020. The largest segment
is the consumer electronics segment and the
largest export segment is of components.
Electronics plays a catalytic role in increasing
production and productivity in key sectors like
power, coal, oil, railways, communication and
process industries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT</i></strong></div>

The Department of Electronics supports and
funds technology development through its
councils set up in various fields namely the
Technology Development Council (TDC) for
areas like components, computer
communication and instrumentation, etc., the
National Radar Council (NRC) for radars,
navigational aids, sonar, underwater electronics
systems, laser and infra-red based detection/
ranging systems, National Microelectronics
Council (NMC) for design and production
technology of LSI/VLSI, ASICs, etc. Electronic
Materials Development Council (EMDC) for
materials, including special ceramics, high purity
metals, gas, etc., and the National Photonics
Council (NPC) for photonic related areas
covering also electronics devices, optical data
storage switching, imaging, vision informatics,
etc. These councils also provide inter-ministerial
forum for overall development, including
generation of production capabilities in their
respective areas. Some of the completed projects
under these programmes have made a definite
impact on the R & D capabilities of the country.
<br>
<br>
Scientific Projects in Specific Areas
Centre for Development of Advanced
Computing (C-DAC) has developed a software
under India’s IT Ministry and Israel’s FTK
Technologies that covers ten scripts and 3000
characters and supports Windows, MAC and
Linux.
‘Lekhika 2007’-a software application is
expected to enable masses in India, who do not
know English, to gain computer skills in their
own language, thanks to its user-friendly,
comprehensive, cost-efficient format. The
software costing between Rs 2500 and Rs 3000
rupees currently supports Hindi, Bengali,
Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Gujarati, Kannada,
Malayalam, Urdu and Punjabi, and soon it
would include all the officially recognized Indian
languages.
<br>
<br>
Time bound projects in specific areas are
being implemented through separate scientific
societies like Centre for Development of
Advanced computing (C-DAC) which has
developed 256 nodes PARAM parallel super
computer of computing power IG flops/7500
MIPs and Centre for Materials for Electronics
Technology (C-MET) to establish technology for
a range of electronic materials. Other funded
projects like Fibre Optics System Development,
Knowledge Based computer System (KBCS),
Advanced Technology Programme on Computer
Networking (ERNET), development of highpower devices. etc., are making satisfactory
progress. To encourage application-oriented
research, design and development, Electronics
Research and Development Centre (ER & CDs)
and Rural Electronics Technology Centre
(RETC), Society for Applied Microwave
Electronics Engineering and Research
(SAMEER), National Centre for Software
Technology, etc., are also being funded to
strengthen respective R & D activities.
The Department has launched a
Standardization, Testing and Quality Control
(STQC) Programme for healthy growth of the
industry. Equipment Certification schemes are
operational covering television receivers and
personal computers, including allied peripherals.
STQC carries out IEC quality assessment system
for electronic components (IECQ) in its role of
National Supervisory Inspectorate (NSI).
There has been a radical transformation in
the character of electronics industry in India since
the development of point contact transistors in
1947-48 which laid the foundation of microelectronics.
Micro-electronics in the country began
appearing around 1970, since then it has made
a remarkable progress in various fields.
Innumerable applications have been successfully
developed and used in industrial, scientific and
other areas.
<br>
<br>
The manufacture of integrated circuits (ICs)
started in the country in 1971 when Bharat
Electronics Limited (BEL) fabricated the TIL 7420
IC with the knowhow developed by Tata
Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR). The
IC produced by BEL so far has SSI/MSI levels of
complexity. Besides, it has fabricated a prototype
watch chip. In the next few years it proposes to
manufacture microprocessors and memory
chips, using, RCA’s technology.
With the trial production of the pulse dialer
chips by the public sector Semiconductor
Complex Limited (SCL) in March 1984, the
country entered the era of large scale integrated
circuits/very large scale integrated circuits. SCL
has developed the 32 KHZ clock chip and two
kinds of semi-customs gate array circuits for
alarm enunciator for Bharat Heavy Electricals
Limited (BHEL) and KELTRON. It has stated the
design of an Electrically Erasable Programme
Read Only Memory (EEPROM) in collaboration
with the AM Santa Clara, USA. SCL would also
undertake manufacture of a broad range of
standard LSIs, including calculator chips,
telecom chips, microprocessors and speech
synthesizers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ELECTRONICS IN THE
SERVICE OF SOCIETY</i></strong></div>

Electronics is a knowledge intensive industry.
It is a dynamic industry and it is also a global
industry. Indian electronics industry is a little
more than 40 years old. Although the numbers
by themselves appear to be quite impressive
when viewed in isolation, if we look at it from
the global point of view we find that we have
miles to go. The Indian electronics industry
constitutes less than 1 per cent of the global
electronics industry. On the other hand, India
has the potential of emerging as a global player.
Electronics therefore is vital in the context of
tackling the immediate national problems. From
the long term point of view also, electronics has
a tremendous potential to improve the quality
of the people, for instance, the electronic media
can be an effective method of eliminating
illiteracy in rural areas, bringing concepts of
public hygiene and improving the quality of life
of the women, etc. Department of Electronics
had been engaged in a programme called Vivek
Darpan which started in May, 1990 in which a
colour TV set with a VCP called Sanghamitra
was placed in different villages and programmes
were shown regularly which were aimed at
removal of illiteracy, advice to women about
public hygiene, etc. Apart from the socially
relevant aspects, a significant impact of
electronics is its employment potential especially
for women.
<br>
<br>
Electronics is also important in the concept
of planned and balanced regional development.
This is because it is a relatively footloose industry
and can be located in different parts of the
country.
It is therefore obvious that electronics is a
sector of industry which is important in the
national development effort and which can
significantly contribute to the improvement of
the quality of life of the people in our country.
Competitive Advantages: When we talk of
competing in the international market, we need
to consider major factors that the important for
a nation to develop competitive advantage. Prof.
Michael Porter had identified a “diamond” of
four factors, namely:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Factoral advantages which will include
factors like low cost labour, raw materials etc.</li>
        <li>Intense competition between the
indigenous players in the same sector.</li>
        <li>Availability of related industries to
provide the necessary infrastructural
support, and family,</li>
        <li>The demand of the consumers.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Therefore we should approach self reliance
in the electronics sector so far as India is
concerned making the best of the advantages that
it has and emerge as a global player.
Import Intensity: When we look at the
competitive advantage of the Indian electronics
industry we find that our industry has got many
weaknesses. Whereas generally in other
industries we have started from the lower end
of raw materials and components and then gone
on to the finished products, in the case of
electronics industry we started from the other
end that is from equipment and then worked in
the reverse direction. As a result there is a high
degree of import intensity in the Indian Industry
today. If we view the import intensity from the
point of view of the raw materials we find that
the import dependence in other sectors of
industry may be 10% whereas it is 50 to 80% so
far as electronics is concerned.
The major imports in this sector broadly fall into
the following categories:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Direct import of finished equipment by
user Ministries/ Departments such as
Defence, Communications, Railways, Civil
aviation, etc.</li>
        <li>Imports of equipment by small actual
users like hospitals, R & D organisations,
educational institutions, etc.</li>
        <li>Imports in the form of personal baggage.</li>
        <li>Imports by the local electronics industry
for production activities, both for local
consumption as well as for exports.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Necessary Imports: The imports under the
first three categories can be minimized only
through increasing the local production base.
This needs considerable imported items under
the following requirements.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Import of capital goods, test equipments,
tools, etc. for production of electronic
equipment and components.</li>
        <li>Import of electronic components,
mechanical hardware items, etc. by
equipment manufacturers.</li>
        <li>Import of raw materials and parts by
electronic component manufacturers.</li>
        <li>Import of components, sub assemblies
parts, etc. by export oriented production
units.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Emphasis on Exports: Due to rapid changes
in technology and new products being
introduced in the international and domestic
market, it may not be possible to cut down the
import content in the Indian electronics products
drastically.
<br>
<br>
USA and UK continues to be major markets
for the IT software and services exports. Markets
across Continental Europe and the Asia Pacific
are also witnessing significant year-on-year
growth. This trend towards a broader
geographic market exposure is positive for the
industry, not only as de-risking measure but also
as a means of accelerating growth by tapping
new markets.
Indigenization: While the above analysis
may give us a macro picture about the overall
balance in foreign exchange and the degree of
indigenization the first area we are concentrating
is the indigenous R & D. It has been found that
there is a tremendous time lag between the
development of the technology in the laboratory
and its application. An attempt is being made to
reduce this time to the market by bringing up
this issue in a forum comprising the industries,
financial institutions, institutions like IITs as well
the Department of Electronics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ELECTRONICS IN HEALTHCARE AND
REHABILITATION</i></strong></div>

The integrated Linear Accelerator (LINAC)
development programme, which was initiated
in 1991, is now in full operation and is designed
to put our country to the forefront of technology
for cancer radiation therapy and treatment
planning. These LINACs have been fabricated
with full participation of five major public sector
undertakings who are jointly taking up the
knowhow for LINAC for commercial

on target. First prototype of computer based
communication aid for the spastics has
undergone field trials with extremely
encouraging feedback from the Spastics Society
of India. A new project has been initiated on
development of thin film bio-medical
transducers. The project will result in products
which have a large demand within the country.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE AND
AGRO BASED INDUSTRIES</i></strong></div>

Microprocessor based drip irrigation and
control system is under field trial stage and will
be evaluated over 2-3 crop-cycles. Short term
trials of soil salinity mapping system using
inductive electro-magnetic principle have been
done and efforts are underway to fabricate a
prototype for extended field trials.
The programme on application of Electronics
in the Industry is being implemented at
AMTRON, Guwahati and MAEP Centre,
Kolkata. AMTRON has developed the
VERMIAC range of instrumentation based on
distributed computer architecture and monitors
four vital processing stages viz. withering, rolling,
fermentation and drying. The system is installed
at Hunwal Tea Estate near Jorhat. MAEP
Kolkata centre has developed an application of
electronic control and instrumentation system

of the project is to develop electronic systems and
facilities for modernising jute industry to make
it competitive in national and international
markets.
<br>
<br>
Various elements of the project are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Modification of existing electronic
instruments/systems available for cotton
textile for application to jute.</li>
        <li>Development of on-line and off-line
instruments/systems for Jute industry.</li>
        <li>Setting up of infrastructure for repair and
maintenance of electronic instruments and
training of mill personnel.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SOCIO-ELECTRONICS PROGRAMME</i></strong></div>

The scheme for training of medical and paramedical personnel was taken up with a view to
provide effective support in the repair and
maintenance of Electro-medical equipment.
Advanced training programme for the para
medical staff has also been worked out and such
training programmes are being conducted
through IHRDE, Trivandrum.
<br>
<br>
<b>Vivek Darpan:</b> Project Vivek Darpan (PVD)
is designed to demonstrate and propagate the
use of the audio visual media as a more cost
effective method for dissemination of socioeconomic information/knowledge in rural areas
as compared to traditional methods/ media.
Several pilot projects have been initiated in
carefully selected villages to show that these
mediums can strengthen and help in taking
knowledge, education and developmental
messages to rural people, particularly women.
This medium is used as an aid for
communication in programmes of rural
development, family welfare and women’s
development. The Department of Electronics as
a scientific department has funded a few early
pilot projects only for establishing costeffectiveness of TV-UVP medium. The objectives
of the Project Vivek Darpan are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Effective dissemination of developmental
motivation and knowledge/skills for rural
folk, especially women using audio-visual
media as multi-user, multi-tasking systems.</li>
        <li>Effectively supplementing the post-literacy
development efforts for rural adults.</li>
        <li>Achieve favourable and sustainable
impact in the areas of family planning,
health and hygiene improvement, social
awareness and productivity improvement.</li>
        <li>Cause extensive replication/spread in
thousands of villages by convincing other
central and state government agencies/
NGOs on the cost-effectiveness of this
media.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The NGOs now implementing Project Vivek
Darpan in 105 Villages are holding one hour
sessions for 5 different set of groups eg. children,
youth, women, general audiences and farmers
every day.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL POLICY ON
ELECTRONICS 2012</i></strong></div>

The National Policy of Electronics envisions
creating a globally competitive Electronics
Systems and Design Manufacturing (ESDM)
industry, including nano-electronics to meet the
country`s needs and serve the international
market. The strategies include setting up of a
National Electronics Mission with industry
participation and renaming the Department of
Information Technology as Department of
Electronics and Information Technology (Deity).
The policy is expected to create an indigenous
manufacturing eco-system for electronics in the

indigenously designed and manufactured chips
creating a more cyber secure ecosystem in the
country. It will enable India to tap the great
economic potential that this knowledge sector
offers. The increased development and manufacturing in the sector will lead to greater economic
growth through more manufacturing and
consequently greater employment in the sector.
The policy sets out to achieve a turnover of
about USD 400 Billion by 2020 involving
investment of about USD 100 Billion. It also aims
at ensuring employment to around 28 million in
the sector by 2020.
<br>
<br>
Major objectives of the policy are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To create an eco-system for a globally
competitive Electronic System Design and

developing and mandating standards and
certification for electronic products and
services to strengthen quality assessment
infrastructure nationwide.</li>
        <li>To develop an appropriate security
ecosystem in ESDM.</li>
        <li>To create long-term partnerships between
ESDM and strategic and core infrastructure sectors-Defence, Atomic Energy,
Space, Railways, Power, Telecommunications, etc.</li>
        <li>To become a global leader in creating
Intellectual Property (IP) in the ESDM
sector by increasing fund flow for R&D,
seed capital and venture capital for startups in the ESDM and nanoelectronics
sectors.</li>
        <li>To develop core competencies in strategic
and core infrastructure sectors like
telecommunications, automotive, avionics,
industrial, medical, solar, Information and
Broadcasting, Railways, etc. through use
of ESDM in these sectors.</li>
        <li>To use technology to develop electronic
products catering to domestic needs,
including rural needs and conditions, as
well as international needs at affordable
price points.</li>
        <li>To expedite adoption of best practices in
e-waste management.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Further to boost the electronics industry
government has launched Electronics
Manufacturing Clusters Scheme
As part of the vision to make India a leading
destination for the Electronics Systems Design
and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector, the draft
National Policy on Electronics (NPE) proposes
to achieve a domestic production of about USD
400 Billion by 2020 in the ESDM sector by
creating an industry friendly policy framework
and ecosystem which provides a level playing
field for the domestic industry. The NPE also
proposes to set up two semiconductor wafer
manufacturing facilities and to create and sustain
a vibrant research and development and
innovation eco-system in the ESDM sector.
To achieve this target the Union Cabinet has
approved the proposal to offer financial support
for the development of Electronics
Manufacturing Clusters (EMCs), as these EMCs
would aid the growth of the Electronics Systems
Design and Manufacturing (ESDM) sector, help
development of entrepreneurial ecosystem, drive
innovation and catalyze the economic growth
of the region by increasing employment
opportunities and tax revenues.
<br>
<br>
The proposed EMCs scheme would support
setting up of both Greenfield and Brownfield
EMCs.
The main features of the proposed EMC
Scheme are as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The assistance would be provided to a
Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) which
should be a legal entity duly registered
for this purpose. The SPV may be
promoted by private companies, industry
associations, financial institutions, R&D
institutions, State or Local governments
or their agencies and units within the
EMC. The SPV should consider including
an academic/research institution to be
part of the proposed SPV for suitable
academic-industry linkages.</li>
        <li>The financial assistance to the SPV shall
be in the form of grant-in-aid only.</li>
        <li>For Greenfield EMCs the assistance will
be restricted to 50% of the project cost
subject to a ceiling of Rs. 50 crore for every
100 acres of land.</li>
        <li>For Brownfield EMCs the assistance will
be restricted to 75% of the project cost
subject to a ceiling of Rs. 50 crore.</li>
        <li>The scheme will be open for applications
for five years from the date of notification.</li>
        <li>The financial assistance under the policy
would be subject to approval by the
Competent Authority following due
process.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

A well developed cluster can give a unit
located in it a cost advantage of 5 to 8% because
of various reasons such as increased supply chain
responsiveness, consolidation of suppliers,
decreased time-to-market, superior access to
talent and lower logistics costs. The cluster
development approach also helps in the
development of entrepreneurial ecosystems
which drive innovation and catalyze the
economic growth of a region by increasing
employment opportunities and tax revenues.
The proposed scheme is expected to help
flow of investment for the development of 
worldclass infrastructure specifically targeted towards
attracting investment in the ESDM sector. Nearly
28 million persons are expected to be employed,
directly or indirectly for the ESDM turnover to
reach USD 400 billion. The policy covers all States
and districts and provides them an opportunity
to attract investments in electronics manufacturing.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COMPUTER REVOLUTION</i></strong></div>

The 21st century is witnessing a computer
revolution in which information processing and
retrieval are being done reliably at incredible
speeds. Microprocessors which made their
impact felt about fifteen years ago are the basis
for a new breed of computers whose ultimate
goal is to stimulate the intelligence of man.
Microcomputers are becoming faster and
cheaper and very soon they are expected to be
as powerful as the mainframe computers. Today
microprocessors can be found in pocket
calculators, industrial robots, home appliances, etc.
The first four generations of computers were
based on the technology of the age to which they
belonged. They were thus based on the vacuum
tube technology, the transistor and printed
circuit technology, the integrated circuit
technology, the transistor and printed circuit
technology, the integrated circuit technology and
the Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI)
technology respectively. The marvel of the fourth
generation VLSI technology is that a
microprocessor weighing a few grams, can store
512 K or 512 X 1024 bits of 0s and 1s.
Computers are analogue or digital machines.
Those converting numbers into physical
quantities, which can very continuously within
a range are called analogue computers while
those using numbers (which are discrete values)
are called digital computers. There is a third class
of computers called hybrid computers, which
have digital storage and switching, but in them
calculations are done in an analogue fashion.
While analogue computers are for specific
scientific/technological operations, such as
harmonic analysis, solution of simultaneous
algebraic and polynominal equations etc. in the
fields such as hydrodynamics, aerodynamics,
industrial control, etc., the digital computers are
universal in that they have applications not only
in the scientific field but also in the fields of
business and administration. Further due to their
superior flexibility and accuracy, the digital
computers dominate the contemporary
computer scene the latest of which are called
microcomputers.
<br>
<br>
<b>Programming Language:</b> Computerware
can be divided into hardware and software. The
five functional units of a computer built with
electronic circuits and electromechanical devices
constitute the hardware. The range of standard
programs or routines supplied by the
manufacturer along with the computer
hardware are referred to as software.
Computer programming is the name given
to the ‘art ‘ of writing a programme in a
programming language, which is a higher level
language. Every machine depending upon its
internal hardware architecture has a unique low
level language called the machine language. In
a binary coded digital computer the machine
language is made of 0s and 1s. To relieve the
programmer from the tedium of writing a
programme in the difficult low-level machine
language, several hundreds of easier high level
programming language, have been developed.
Of these FORTRAN (Formula translation), and
BASIC (Beginners All purpose Symbolic
Instruction Code) were the most widely accepted
general purpose programming languages while
COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language)
was the most successful programming language
for business purposes.
<br>
<br>
BASIC was an on-line conversational
language. It had been quickly adopted by
commercial time sharing services. With the
advent of microprocessors in the mid-70s, BASIC
was made available as a “Read Only Memory
(ROM) Chip”. BASIC had many dialects and
several of these included features not in the ANSI
(American National Standard Institute), which
standardized a subset of BASIC to promote
uniformity. cBASIC and BASICA are two of the
versions of BASIC.
<br>
<br>
<b>Present day Micros:</b> The micro-computer
industry was revolutionized by the entry of IBM,
which started marketing PCs in 1980.
Essentially a micro computer consists of a
system unit. The printer is an auxiliary unit
“essential to get the output from the microcomputer as a hard-copy. The standard type
writer keys viz. A to Z, 0 to 9 and certain special
characters which together constitute the alphanumeric characters are an essential part of all
the micro computer keyboards, which also have
two or three additional groups of keys. One of
these is a set of numeric keys (0 to 9) arranged
as in a calculator for ease of data entry.
The VDU (Visual Display Unit) is the video
display terminal for the micro computer system.
This can be either a monochromatic (black and
white) or colour monitor. The normal printer
interface is for the monochromatic display unit.
A Colour/Graphics monitor Adopter board
(or oriented circuit) is essential as an interface to
enable the use of a colour monitor. A colour TV
set can also be used with a radio frequency
modulator.
<br>
<br>
The system unit contains the heart of the
micro-computer-a micro processor the dynamic
Random Access Memory (RAM), an extended
microsoft BASIC as Read Only Memory (ROM),
floppy disk drive for auxiliary storage, a built in
speaker and some expansion slots for system
enlargement. Additional dynamic memory
(RAM) board can be used to enhance the memory
of the micro computer. The ROM stores
permanently, programmes essential for the
operation of the micro-computers.
Modular: The micro-computer is modular in
design and the modules (or blocks) are
interconnected through a bus. The microprocessor or (Silicon) chip combines the ALU
and the control unit, the memory (ROM and
RAM), the micro -processor, a interfaces for the
keyboard, VDU etc, expansion slots, speaker and
timing circuits are all on the system board of
mother board of a microcomputer system.
Microsoft BASIC is a version of BASIC, which
is standard with the IMN-PC. The BASIC
interpreter is contained in 40 K of ROM and the
IBM-PC uses three versions of BASICS called
cassette BASIC, disk BASIC and Advanced
BASIC the first two are used when the PC has a
cassette or disk interface while Advanced BASIC
has all the capabilities of the other two as well
as additional features necessary for the colour/
graphics mode.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUPER COMPUTERS</i></strong></div>

A supercomputer is a computer that is at the
frontline of current processing capacity,
particularly speed of calculation. Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s and
were designed primarily by Seymour Cray at
Control Data Corporation (CDC), which led the
market into the 1970s until Cray left to form his
own company, Cray Research.
The computers characterized by their very
long size and very high processing speed are
known as supercomputer. They are used in
specialized area such as defence, aircraft, design,
weather research and other scientific works. The
first super computer was the ILLIAC IV made
by Burroughs and University of Illinois in 1965.
The term supercomputer itself is rather fluid,
and today’s supercomputer tends to become
tomorrow’s ordinary computer. CDC’s early
machines were simply very fast scalar processors,
some ten times the speed of the fastest machines
offered by other companies. In the 1970s most
supercomputers were dedicated to running a
vector processor, and many of the newer players
developed their own such processors at a lower
price to enter the market. The early and mid1980s saw machines with a modest number of
vector processors working in parallel to become
the standard. Typical numbers of processors were
in the range of four to sixteen. In the later 1980s
and 1990s, attention turned from vector
processors to massive parallel processing systems
with thousands of “ordinary” CPUs, some being
off the shelf units and others being custom
designs. Today, parallel designs are based on “off
the shelf” server-class microprocessors, such as
the Power PC, Opteron, or Xeon, and most
modern supercomputers are now highly-tuned
computer clusters using commodity processors
combined with custom interconnects.
<br>
<br>
Some other areas such as molecular
biophysics, quantum chemistry and reaction
dynamics require high-speed numeral
computing too. A conventional computer cannot
perform a high-speed computing due largely to
the physical limitation known as the Von
Neumann barrier. But a super computer based
on parallel processor (that breaks a task into a
large number of subtasks and each subtask can
be carried out independently at its own pace)
architect can have a computing power as high
as 1000 mega flops.
Supercomputers are used for highly
calculation-intensive tasks such as problems
involving quantum physics, weather forecasting,
climate research, molecular modeling
(computing the structures and properties of
chemical compounds, biological
macromolecules, polymers, and crystals),
physical simulations (such as simulation of
airplanes in wind tunnels, simulation of the
detonation of nuclear weapons, and research into
nuclear fusion).
<br>
<br>
The parallel processor based computer
systems are being planned to be used in the
following areas:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>C-DAC</i></strong></div>

The Centre for Development of Advanced
Computing (C-DAC), a scientific society under
the administrative control of the Department of
Electronics, Government of India, has designed
a general purpose Super computer ‘PARAM’.
The centre has transferred the know-how for the
PARAM Supercomputer to many organisations
in public as well as private sector. The parallel
computers developed by the C-DAC are already
available commercially. C-DAC has deployed
several Param supercomuters in India and
abroad. It has sold Param supercomputers to the
UK, Germany, Philippines and Singapore. In
particular, it has deployed a Param 10000
version in Russia for about Rs 2 crore under a
commercial contract. C-DAC earlier announced
its plans to install supercomputers at 12 premier
educational institutions such as IIS and IITs.
The Supercomputer is endowed with
advanced programming environment ‘PARAM’.
The entire design and development of PARAM,
both hardware and software, have been done
indigenously. Only microprocessor, memories
glue-logic chips and winchester disks were
imported.
<br>
<br>
The Advanced Numerical Research and
Analysis Group (ANURAG) of the DRDO has
also designed and developed a high-speed userfriendly super computer known as PACE
(Processor for Aerodynamics Computation and
Evaluations). This system finds application in
several number crunching applications
including geology, remote sensing, aircraft design
and weather studies.
E-Learning framework by C-DAC: Pune
based Centre for Development of Advance
Computing (C-DAC) is developing a web-based
project envisages providing an e-learning
framework based learning management system.
The institution is designing the e-learning
framework in such a way that any kind of course
material can be made available to large number
of students via net.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bioinformatics:</b> The last few decades have
been huge advances in the biological sciences.
Especially in the last years, the availability of
sophisticated technology has resulted in the
increasingly rapid sequencing of the genetic
material of several species. This deluge of
information has necessitated the creation of a
means to manage the data in terms of organizing,
indexing and storing it. This has led to the
evolution of the science of bioinformatics.
Dasher: Dasher is a data entry interface
developed to replace the standard QWERTY
keyboard layout. It is nearly twice as efficient,
more accurate and easier on the eyes and above
all the prototype program is designed to be
particularly useful for computer users who are
unable to type using a conventional keyboard.
<br>
<br>
<b>Woz Net:</b> Woz Net is a simple and
inexpensive wireless network that uses radio
signals and global positioning satellite data to
keep track of a cluster of inexpensive tags within
a one or two-mile radius of each base station.
Woz Net includes a home-based station that has
the ability to track the location of dozens or even
hundreds of small wireless devices that can be
attached to people, pets or property. The devices
or tags will be able to generate alerts, notifying
the owner by phone or e-mail message when a
child arrives at school, a dog leaves the yard, or
a car leaves the parking lot.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Supercomputerss of the World</i></strong></div>

The list of supercomputers was announced
on June 17, 2013 during the opening session of
the 2013 International Supercomputing
Conference in Leipzig, Germany. Tianhe-2, a
supercomputer developed by China’s National
University of Defense Technology, is the world’s
new No. 1 system with a performance of 33.86
petaflop/s on the Linpack benchmark, according
to the 41st edition of the twice-yearly TOP500
list of the world’s most powerful supercomputers.
Tianhe-2, or Milky Way-2, will be deployed
at the National Supercomputer Center in
Guangzho, China, by the end of 2013. Tianhe-2
has 16,000 nodes, each with two Intel Xeon
IvyBridge processors and three Xeon Phi
processors for a combined total of 3,120,000
computing cores.
<br>
<br>
Titan, a Cray XK7 system installed at the U.S.
Department of Energy’s (DOE) Oak Ridge
National Laboratory and previously the No. 1
system, is now ranked No. 2. Titan achieved
17.59 petaflop/s on the Linpack benchmark
using 261,632 of its NVIDIA K20x accelerator
cores. Titan is one of the most energy efficient
systems on the list, consuming a total of 8.21 MW

number cruncher is capable of operating at so
called “Petaflop” speeds - the equivalent of 1,000
trillion calculations per second.The ultra
powerful machines will be used for complex
simulations to study everything from particle
physics to nanotechnology.
<br>
<br>
<b>Blue Gene Project:</b> Blue Gene is an IBM
Research project dedicated to exploring the
frontiers in supercomputing: in computer
architecture, in the software required to
program and control massively parallel
systems, and in the use of computation to
advance our understanding of important
biological processes such as protein folding. IBM
and its collaborators are currently exploring a
growing list of applications, including
hydrodynamics, quantum chemistry, molecular
dynamics, climate modeling and financial
modeling.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Param Yuva II</i></strong></div>

Param Yuva II was developed by the Centre
for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC) and inaugurated on February 8, 2013.
Param Yuva II is the first supercomputer that
has crossed 500 teraflops in computing power
in the country. Param Yuva II is the fastest
supercomputer in India and 62nd fastest in the
world. The supercomputer also promises to be
energy efficient with 35 per cent reduction in
energy consumption as compared to the earlier
facility.
<br>
<br>
The supercomputer is expected to be of great
help to the scientific community. Industries like
pharmaceuticals, bio informatics, aeronautical
engineering will also benefit. Seismic data
processing can be done much more efficiently
with this new computer. The main users of the
supercomputer would be the scientific institutes,
research laboratories and universities.
The supercomputer would also help in
reducing the time-frame in weather predictions.
If researchers currently collect satellite data to
predict the conditions for a six-km region, the
supercomputer could help cover a wider region,
may be up to 10 km.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EKA Supercomputer</i></strong></div>

EKA is a supercomputer built by the
Computational Research Laboratories with
technical assistance and hardware provided by
Hewlett-Packard. When it was installed in
November 2007, it was the 4th fastest in the
world, and fastest in Asia.
EKA has 1,794 computing nodes and has a
theoretical peak performance of 172.2 Teraflops
(tflops or trillion floating point operations per
second) and a sustained performance of 132.8
teraflops based on the LINPACK benchmarks
which are used by the worldwide community
to rank supercomputers based on performance.
Presently, it is ranked at 291.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Infrared Supercomputer</i></strong></div>

The University of Utah is implementing a
computer that makes use of terahertz radiation
instead of electricity. It will be the first computer
powered by infrared rays rather than electricity,
a super-computer capable of operating at
terahertz radiation (far-infrared), the only still
unexplored frontier in the electromagnetic
spectrum. It is being developed by a group of
scientists at the University of Utah. It will
probably require ten years of work to be
completed. Currently, the groups of scientists are
making waveguides, the appropriate “channels”
that will convey radiation and transmit it from
one point to another.
<br>
<br>
To mark a decisive step forward in research,
the good results obtained by the use of special
sheets of perforated stainless steel which is
proving able to lead effectively terahertz
radiation (the portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum that is between microwaves and
infrared, and whose wavelength is between 1
mm and 100 micrometers). As described in the
study of Ajay Nahata, these sheets will be “the
matrix” on which to build the future of computer
circuits.
The possible use of these radiations so far has
escaped both electronics and optics. According
to the researchers these will allow the
development of fast and extraordinarily devices,
with efficient performance from sensors used in
anti-terrorism controls to next generation
computers and data transfer via the Internet.
Manual mask-making facilities exist in many
organisations of the country. The current
capability in the country in mask fabrication is
based on pattern generator and photoreceptor
which have been in regular use at Bharat
Electronics Limited (BEL), Bangalore for several
years now and lately at CEERI, Pilani. Both the
organisations have CAD facilities as well, which
generate the mask drawings on magtapes. These
serve as the input to the pattern generator which
generates the pattern on a high resolution glass
plate for making working masks.
About a dozen organisations in the country
have facilities for fabricating Hybrid Micro
Circuits (HMCs) primarily for in-house use. BEL
and ITI have been regularly producing HMCs
for the last few years. While BEL has produced
hybrids for several application areas eg. Audio
frequency amplifiers, radio frequency amplifiers;
ITI has mostly concentrated on communication
circuits . Another public sector, Electronics
Corporation of India Ltd., Hyderabad has a
modest facility for simple circuits.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Earth Simulator</i></strong></div>

The Earth Simulator was developed at the
Earth Simulator Center in Yokohama, Japan.
The Earth Simulator was a highly parallel vector
supercomputer for running global climate
models to evaluate the effects of global warming
and problems in solid earth geophysics. The
system was developed for Japan Aerospace
Exploration Agency, Japan Atomic Energy
Research Institute, and Japan Marine Science and
Technology Centre (JAMSTEC) in 1997.
Construction started in October 1999, and the
site officially opened on March 11, 2002. The
project cost 60 billion yen.
<br>
<br>
The Earth Simulator supercomputer took the
No. 1 spot in June 2002 with a performance of
35.86 Tflop/s (trillions of calculations per
second) running the Linpack benchmark –
almost five times higher than the performance
of the IBM ASCI White system that had stood at
the top of the previous three lists. Earth Simulator
was the fastest supercomputer in the world from
2002 to 2004. Its capacity was surpassed by IBM's
Blue Gene/L prototype on September 29, 2004.
For now, the Earth Simulator is being used
to track global sea temperatures, rainfall and
crustal movement to predict natural disasters.
The computer can already predict the path of a
typhoon or a volcanic corruption with
remarkable precision. It was able to run holistic
simulations of global climate in both the
atmosphere and the oceans down to a resolution
of 10 km.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>QUANTUM COMPUTERS</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>What is quantum computing?</i></strong></div>

Quantum computing is essentially
harnessesing and exploiting the amazing laws
of quantum mechanics to process information.
A traditional computer uses long strings of ‘bits,’
which encode either a zero or a one. A quantum
computer, on the other hand, uses quantum bits,
or qubits. Well a qubit is a quantum system that
encodes the zero and the one into two
distinguishable quantum states. But, because
qubits behave quantumly, we can capitalize on
the phenomena of ‘superposition’ and
‘entanglement.’
<br>
<br>
Researchers have for the first time succeeded
in building the first working computers based
on the principles of quantum mechanics. The
discovery has touched off a wave of excitement
among physicists and computer scientists and is
leading dozens of research centres worldwide
to embark on similar experiments heralding the
advent of an era of so-called quantum
computers-specialised machines that may one
day prove thousands or even millions of times
faster than today’s most powerful supercomputers.
In fact, the practical demonstration of a
computer based on the laws of quantum physics
has created quite a flutter in the computing
world. Playing with the complexities of nuclear
physics and juggling sub-atomic particles,
researches at IBM recently proved that a
quantum computer can actually work, and may
outperform the conventional computers by a
large margin. According to the scientists at IBM’s
Research Centre in San Jose, it took just a single
step to solve a mathematical problem that would
take a conventional computer up to four distinct
steps to handle. This experiment was described
as the first experiment to confirm theoretical
predictions made earlier that building a working
machine based on quantum computing
principles was possible.
<br>
<br>
In future, this research will help surpass
contemporary silicon-based computer and chip
architecture, taking advantage of some of the
findings of 20th century physics, particularly, the
notion that the same sub-atomic particle can exist
in two seemingly opposite quantum states. As a
matter of fact, the quantum computer used by
the IBM team works precisely on the principle
of dual states-a phenomenon not possible with
conventional silicon chips.
The IBM experiment offers a glimpse of what
could become a critical computing technology
of the future, particularly, suited to handling
elaborate security codes and solving certain types
of mathematical problems that tend to baffle
conventional computers. A quantum computer
could help computer engineers simulate the
behaviour of conventional computers based on
such tiny transistors. Unlike today’s
conventional computers, which are assembled
from arrays of millions of digital switches that
can be rapidly switched on and off, quantum
computers are assembled from moleculerized
units known as qubits.
<br>
<br>
Although there are still major hurdles to be
overcome before quantum computers can be
applied to general problems, yet undoubtedly,
its emergence could have a profound impact on
modern cryptography. Despite its promise and
recent progress, the scientists acknowledged that
there is much work left to do to create
commercially or scientifically useful quantum
computers.
<br>
<br>
<b>Photonic Quantum Computers:</b> A brighter
future than ever
Quantum computers work by manipulating
quantum objects as, for example, individual
photons, electrons or atoms and by harnessing
the unique quantum features. Not only do
quantum computers promise a dramatic
increase in speed over classical computers in a
variety of computational tasks; they are designed
to complete tasks that even a supercomputer
would not be able to handle. Although, in recent
years, there has been a rapid development in
quantum technology the realization of 
a fullsized quantum computer is still very challenging.
While it is still an exciting open question which
architecture and quantum objects will finally
lead to the outperformance of conventional
supercomputers, current experiments show that
some quantum objects are better suited than
others for particular computational tasks.
Computational power of photons: The huge
advantage of photons -- a particular type of
bosons -- lies in their high mobility. The research
team from the University of Vienna in
collaboration with scientist from the University
of Jena (Germany) has recently realized a socalled boson sampling computer that utilizes
precisely this feature of photons. They inserted
photons into a complex optical network where
they could propagate along many different
paths. According to the laws of quantum Physics,
the photons seem to take all possible paths at
the same time. This is known as superposition.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DNA COMPUTER</i></strong></div>

A group of scientists have developed a
computing device using a trillion living cells. This
device is so small that it can fit in a drop of water.
DNA computing, also known as molecular
computing, is a new approach to massively
parallel computation. This microscopic computer
uses enzymes as hardware, which in turn
manipulates DNA molecules as software. This
Computer, creating a Single mathematical
computing machine, is called a finite automation.
A DNA computer is basically a collection of
specially selected DNA strands whose
combinations will result in the solution to some
problem. Technology is currently available both
to select the initial strands and to filter the final
solution. The promise of DNA computing is
massive parallelism: with a given setup and
enough DNA, one can potentially solve huge
problems by parallel search. This can be much
faster than a conventional computer, for which
massive parallelism would require large amounts
of hardware, not simply more DNA.
<br>
<br>
This “biological nano-Computer” was
created by a group of scientists headed by Mr.
Ehud Shapiro, a Professor at the Weizmann
Institute of Science, Israel. They have devised
that the computer can perform 330 trillion
operations per second, more than 100,000 times
the speed of the fastest PC.
The living cell contains incredible molecular
machines that manipulate information -
encoding molecules available in the form of
Codon (specific arrangement of DNA). In this
way these devices are fundamentally very similar
to computation.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>DNA can be used to compute a class of
problems that are difficult or impossible
to solve using traditional computing
methods.</li>
        <li>It is an example of computation at a
molecular level, potentially a size limit that
may never be reached by the
semiconductor industry.</li>
        <li>Data density of DNA is impressive.</li>
        <li>DNA has enormous power of parallel
processing. In one fiftieth of a teaspoon
of a solution, approximately 1014 DNA
flight numbers were simultaneously
concatenated in one second. Probably not
even the fastest supercomputer available
today could accomplish such a task so
quickly.</li>
        <li>Molecular computers also have the
potential for extraordinary energy
efficiency. In principle, one Joule is
sufficiently for approximately 2×1019
ligation operations. This remarkable
considering that the second law of
thermodynamics dictates a theoretical
maximum of 34×1019 (irreversible)
operations per joule (at roomtemperature). Existing supercomputers are
far less efficient, executing at most 1019
operations per Joule.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Future:</b> The potential of molecular computation is impressive. Researchers are now
acknowledging that it would be better if
molecular computation is aimed at information
processing on molecular scale. Its applications
in biotechnology and nano-technology have
already started. In a DNA computer, the input
tape and the output tape are the two strands of
DNA attached to the surface of a chip. They have
further proposed to use intelligent DNA chips
that can perform logical reasoning and learning
by using DNA computation. Nano-technology
is another such area.
<br>
<br>
Interestingly, a molecular machine which
can measure its environmental factors and
process information technology can be designed,
then such a computing device implanted within
a living body will be able to integrate signals from
several sources and compute a response in terms
of an organic delivery device for a drug or a
signal- a dream application of nature’s own
molecule in medical science.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DNA-based logic circuits</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>DNA computation is an emerging field
that enables the assembly of complex
circuits based on defined DNA logic gates.</li>
        <li>DNA-based logic gates have previously
been operated through purely chemical
means, controlling logic operations
through DNA strands or other
biomolecules. Although gates can operate
through this manner, it limits temporal
and spatial control of DNA-based logic
operations.</li>
        <li>A photochemically controlled DNA gate
was developed through the incorporation
of caged thymidine nucleotides into a
DNA-based logic gate.</li>
        <li>By using light as the logic inputs, both
spatial control and temporal control were
achieved.</li>
        <li>In addition, design rules for lightregulated DNA logic gates were derived.
A step-response, which can be found in a
controller, was demonstrated. Photochemical inputs close the gap between
DNA computation and silicon-based
electrical circuitry, since light waves can
be directly converted into electrical output
signals and vice versa.</li>
        <li>This connection is important for the
further development of an interface
between DNA logic gates and electronic
devices, enabling the connection of
biological systems with electrical circuits.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PHASE-CHANGE MEMORY CHIPS</i></strong></div>

Phase-change memory chips, an emerging
storage technology, could soon dethrone flash
memory in smartphones, cameras and laptops.
The technology relies on special substances
called phase-change materials (PCMs). These are
materials, such as salt hydrates, that are capable
of storing and releasing large amounts of energy
when they move from a solid to a liquid state
and back again. Traditionally they have been
used in cooling systems and, more recently, in
solar-thermal power stations, where they store
heat during the day that can be released to
generate power at night. PCM memory chips rely
on glass-like materials called chalcogenides,
typically made of a mixture of germanium,
antimony and tellurium.
<br>
<br>
PCM memory chips have several advantages
over flash memory, which works by:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Trapping electrons in an enclosure called
a “floating gate”, built on top of a
modified form of transistor.</li>
        <li>The value stored in each cell is 1 or 0.</li>
        <li>Some prototype PCM memory devices can
store and retrieve data 100 times faster
than flash memory.</li>
        <li>It is extremely durable, capable of being
written and rewritten at least 10m times.</li>
        <li>Accordingly, flash memory needs special
controllers to keep track of which parts
of the chip have become unreliable, so they
can be avoided. This increases the cost
and complexity of flash, and slows it down.</li>
        <li>PCM offers greater potential for future
miniaturisation than flash.</li>
        <li>As flash-memory cells get smaller and
devices become denser, the number of
electrons held in the floating gate
decreases.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>OPTICAL COMPUTING</i></strong></div>

Optical or Photonic computing is intended
to use photons or light particles, produced by
lasers or diodes, in place of electrons. Compared
to electrons, photons have a higher bandwidth.
Presently, computers use the movement of
electrons in-and-out of transistors to do logic.
Most research projects focus on replacing current
computer components with optical equivalents,
resulting in an optical digital computer system
processing binary data.
<br>
<br>
This approach appears to offer best shortterm prospects for commercial optical
computing, since optical components could be
integrated into traditional computers to produce
an optical or electronic hybrid. However,
optoelectronic devices lose 30 per cent of their
energy converting electrons into photons and
back. This also slows down transmission of
messages. All-optical computers eliminate the
need for optical-electrical-optical (OEO)
conversions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SIMPUTER</i></strong></div>

The word 'Simputer' is an acronym for
'simple, inexpensive and multilingual people's
computer'. Simputer is a low cost hand held
computing device which can offer inexpensive
and efficient information and networking
environment for people who are on the wrong
side of the digital divide. The simple computer
or simputer runs on three AAA batteries or
direct power supply. With memory capabilities
of 32 MB RAM and a GNU/Linux operating
system, it is more powerful than a palmtop.
Further, it can be connected to internet and
peripherals like keyboard or mouse can also be
added. Besides, Simputer has text to speech
capabilities in several Indian languages, text and
editing functions, portable literacy instructor,
voice messages, use of smart card facility for
commercial transactions, etc. The Simputer can
be put to a range of uses like micro banking
through cooperatives and post offices, railway
ticketing, data collection, sales automation, in
education and literacy programmes. Simputers
are generally used in environments where
computing devices such as PCs cannot be used.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTERNET</i></strong></div>

Internet is an inter-networked system of
computers that allows free flow of information
from one part of the network to any other,
provided the information is packaged according
to certain conventions. The Internet, however,
was intimidating arena till now. Its gates were
open only to those who had mastered computer
commands. But, with the introduction of World
Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, there is no need to
master the computer command. On this web,
anyone can create a home page, which millions
of users can watch on their computers and
respond.
<br>
<br>
In fact, the web is a hyper-media information
storage system linking resources around the
world. Browsers allow highlighted words or
icons, called hyper-links, to display text, video,
graphics and sound on a local computer screen,
no matter where resource is actually located.
Application: Nowadays, the importance of
Internet is so profound that it penetrates every
walk of human life. Marketing in ‘global village’
is now a reality due to Internet. Few years back,
it was just a medium for exchange of academic
information and was used mostly by
academicians and commerce. Today, all sorts of
transactions and business deals are being
conducted on Net.
<br>
<br>
On-line banks are being set up to service
clients through the Net. A wide range of services
are now being offered through the Net deposits,
loans, transfer of funds etc. Net sites act as single
window for virtual shop and offer gateways to
the web-sites of scores of other shops.
Publishing business is thriving on the Net.
Publishers are using the Net to serve a portion
of the magazine to individual customers. On-line
travel agencies are able to provide the latest and
updated data of flight timing, hotel availability,
reservations in train etc. to the homes their
customers and, thereby, enabling the customers
to perform all the transactions in the shape of
movies, music, sports etc.
<br>
<br>
Internet in India: In India, Videsh Sanchar
Nigam Limited (VSNL) provides Internet services
since August 1995. These services which were
offered initially from the four metros of Mumbai,
New Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai, found
excellent demand and were soon expanded to
cover a network of 42 nodes being operated by
the Department of Telecommunications (DOT)
and VSNL by 1998.
6th November 1998 was a landmark day in
the history of Internet in India, when a
revolutionary new policy was unveiled. The
policy permits unlimited number of Internet
players with no licence fees for the first five
years, thus setting the stage for a completely
deregulated operating environment. VSNL offers
two types of services for Internet users:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Shell account in which one can have only
text access and cannot download
graphics;</li>
            <li>TCP/IP account in which one can have
access to graphics as well. It is more
efficient and, therefore, more expensive.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

The Indian Internet scene is headed for a
radical change in the years ahead, with the
National Association of Software and Services
Companies (NASSCOM) predicting a massive
increase in the number of Internet users.
With the arena now clear for a deregulated
and open playing ground for ISPs, the stage is
set for the rapid growth of Internet in India.
However, the growth will be critically dependent
on how some of the factors such as requirement
of access lines and national backbone
connectivity are addressed.
<br>
<br>
In 2013, India ranked third in the number of
active users next only to China and US, the
overall Internet penetration in the country is 11
per cent. India on last count had 120 million
active Internet users, up from 81 million users in
2010. According to 2013 global ‘Internet World
Stats’ report, around 2.7 billion people are using
the Internet world wide which corresponds to
39 per cent of the world’s population.
Real Time Service Management: Real Time
Service Management is software developed by
California based company SupportSoft in
December 2003. It enables computer makers to
provide automated support and remote
correction of faults to millions of users of Personal
Computers (PCs), laptops and pocket computers.
The core of the RTSM is a solution, called
“Resolution Suite’, which when embedded in
user devices, will help them to proactively heal
themselves, without having to make calls to
service centres or install additional chunks of
software.
FPX: Filed-programmable Port Extender
(FPX) is a hardware platform that can stop
malicious software (malware) such as viruses and
worms long before it reaches computers. John
Lockwood, a computer scientist at Washington
University, has developed it. The FPX can scan
each and every byte of every data packet
transmitted through a network at a rate of 2.4
billion bits per second. The FPX uses the Field
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) Circuits to
scan computer viruses and worms quickly.
In much the same way that a human virus
spreads between people that come in contact,
computer viruses and Internet worms spread
when computers come in contact over the
Internet. Viruses spread when a computer user
downloads unsafe software, opens a malicious
attachment, or exchanges infected computer
programmes over a network. Existing technologies do little to stop the virus or worm spread.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Internet for the Blind</i></strong></div>

Centre for Development of Advanced
Computing (C-DAC) and companies like
Kolkata-based Webel Mediatronics have
developed computer software and hardware
that would enable the visually handicapped to
access Internet. Microsoft has opened two cyber
cafes in Mumbai and Delhi that provide specially
designed software and hardware to allow the
blind to use Internet. The Delhi cyber cafe is
equipped with state-of-the-art technology,
including a JAWS software that allows the
visually impaired to surf the net by voice enabling
both input and output commands. The various
tools developed by the C-DAC and Kolkatabased Webel Mediatronics are:
Vachanter: This Text-to-speech software
developed by C-DAC enables the user to browse
through websites through listening.
Text to Braille: It can convert text in any
format to Braille and store it on the computer.
Tactile Device: It is an alternative to paper
prints of Braille material.
Braille to Text: It is a software that enables
blind people to enter data in braille using a 6
key keyboard.
Braille Printer: It is a PC-based embosser.
Ipv6
<br>
<br>
Indian Internet service providers and
Government agencies have decided to adopt a
new Net protocol which will enable creation of
trillions of new Internet addresses. The new net
protocol is known as Internet Protocol version 6
(IPv6), it will offer improved address space,
quality of service and data security capabilities.
All Government Web sites would migrate to
the new Internet protocol being adopted globally
by 2013. The Department of Telecom stated that
27 websites have already been brought on IPv6
platform in India. Globally, several companies,
including Google and Facebook have switched
to the new IP version. Indian telecom companies
will also move to the new system over the next
few months.
The new version of internet protocol is
necessary to prevent the Internet running out of
available addresses for new devices. India at
present has 35 million IPv4 addresses against a
user base of about 360 million data users and
Government has a target of 160 million and 600
million broadband customers by 2017 and 2020,
respectively.
<br>
<br>
The existing technology IPv4 is already
getting choked and expected to run out of space
soon as consumers increasingly use broadband
and Net services on mobile devices. The IPv6 has
an in-built security protocol called IPSec, which
authenticates and secures all IP data. The data
carrying capacity of IPv6 networks is also going
to be higher.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IT IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

Over the years, Indian IT service offerings
have evolved from application development and
maintenance, to emerge as full service players
providing testing services, infrastructure
services, consulting and system integration. The
coming of a new decade heralds a strategic shift
for IT services organisations, from a ‘one factory,
one customer’ model to a ‘one factory, all
customers’ model. Central to this strategy is the
growing customer acceptance of Cloud-based
solutions which offer best in class services at
reduced capital expenditure levels.
The ITES sector has emerged as a key driver
of growth for the Indian IT industry. This
segment is poised to grow very rapidly, worldwide, over the next few years. The IT–ITES
industry has two major components: IT
Services and Business Process Outsourcing
(BPO). The growth in the service sector in India
has been led by the IT–ITES sector, contributing
substantially to increase in GDP, employment,
and exports.
<br>
<br>
The Indian software and services industry
has emerged as one of the fastest growing sectors
in the Indian economy. IT services exports is the
fastest growing segment, growing by 19 per cent
in FY2012, to account for exports of USD 40
billion. IT services is the fastest growing segment
in the Indian domestic market, growing by 18
per cent to reach Rs 589 billion, driven by
increasing focus by service providers.
According to NASSCOM, the IT–BPO sector
has increased its contribution to India's GDP from
1.2 per cent in FY1998 to 7.5 per cent in
FY2012. The IT–BPO sector in India aggregated
revenues of US$100 billion in FY2012, where
export and domestic revenue stood at US$69.1
billion and US$31.7 billion respectively, growing
by over 9 per cent. Aggregate IT software and
services revenue (excluding hardware) is
estimated at USD 88 billion.
<br>
<br>
Software Technology Parks of India (STPI):
STPI centres act as “single-window” in providing
services to the software exporters and incubation
infrastructure to Small and Medium Enterprises
(SMEs). The STP Scheme has been extremely
successful in fostering the growth of the software
industry. The exports made by STP Units have
grown manifolds over the years.
STPI has established new centres including
High speed Data Communication facilities at
Puducherry, Nasik, Thirunelveli, Allahabad and
Kolhapur. STPI is also executing Cyber City
Project of Government of Mauritius. The STPI
Scheme is lauded as one of the most effective
schemes for the promotion of exports of IT and
ITES. The 51 STPI centres that have been set up
since inception of the programme have given a
major boost to IT and ITES exports.
National Informatics Centre (NIC): NIC
provides informatics services for decision support
to government offices/bodies at national, state,
district and block levels. It offers network services
over Ku-band Wireless Metropolitan Area
Network (MANs) and Local Area Networks
(LANs), with NICNET gateway for Internet
resources, facilitating informatics services for
decentralised planning, improvement in
government services, and wider transparency of
national and local governments

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CYBER SECURITY IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

The impact of information communication
technology is being realised day by day in India.
There has been visible introduction of ICT across
the country of one billion plus population. One
of the hallmarks of the fledging ministry was get
Parliament to enact the Information Technology
Act (IT Act) 2000. This Act gave the legal
sanctity to electronic commerce in the country
and also provided for some basic laws and
regulations to address the usage of the internet
medium.
<br>
<br>
<b>National e-Governance Plan (NEGP):</b>
Today the number of internet users in country is
growing rapidly and it would grow much further
as connectivity charges reduce and multilingual
applications become more prevalent and user
friendly. The present efforts to implement the
robust National e-Governance Plan (NEGP) by
the central government will also see a major user
base for internet based application in the country.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>There are quite a few advantages for a
major thrust towards on online regime
that includes e-governance and ecommerce initiatives.</li>
        <li>There would be major impact on bringing
efficiency into the system and also
reducing public corruption.</li>
        <li>The potential of internet to reach the
masses as a medium for information
dissemination in far-flung areas is long
very strong.</li>
        <li>Internet reduces a lot of the transaction
time and costs, as is witness in the real
world and that way it adds to national
productivity and wealth.</li>
        <li>More and more critical systems are
depending on Internet and this helps in
realising many basic requirements of life.</li>
        <li>There is a major social dimension to the
spread of the Internet. There is more social

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Cyber Security Policy 2013</i></strong></div>

On July 2, 2013, the Union Government
released its ambitious National Cyber Security
Policy 2013. The development of the policy was
prompted by a variety of factors, including the
growth of India’s information technology
industry, an increasing number of cyber attacks
and the country’s “ambitious plans for rapid
social transformation.” The policy sets forth 14
diverse objectives that range from enhancing the
protection of India’s critical infrastructure, to
assisting the investigation and prosecution of
cyber crime, to developing 500,000 skilled
cybersecurity professionals over the next five
years.
To accomplish these objectives, the policy
details numerous action items for the Indian
government, including:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Designating a national agency to
coordinate all cybersecurity matters;</li>
        <li>Encouraging all private and public
organizations to designate a Chief
Information Security Officer responsible
for cybersecurity;</li>
        <li>Developing a dynamic legal framework
to address cybersecurity challenges in the
areas of cloud computing, mobile
computing and social media;</li>
        <li>Operating a National Critical Information
Infrastructure Protection Center;</li>
        <li>Promoting research and development in
cybersecurity;</li>
        <li>Enhancing global cooperation in
combatting cybersecurity threats;</li>
        <li>Fostering education and training
programs in cybersecurity;</li>
        <li>Establishing public and private partnerships
to determine best practices in cybersecurity.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Information Board</i></strong></div>

The National Information Board is the
highest policy making body for cyber security
and is was set up in the year 2002 and is chaired
by the National Security Adviser. The NIB acts
as the highest policy formulation body at the level
and periodically reports to the cabinet committee
on security of the Government of India, headed
by the Prime Minister. The NIB consists of 21
members most of them are secretaries of the
government of India of various ministries. Two
organizations support the NIB directly. The
National Technology Research Organisation
(NTRO) to provide technical cyber security and
intelligence and the National Security Council
Secretariat (NSCS) for coordinating cybersecurity activities across the country, covering
both the public and private sectors.
<br>
<br>
Directly below the NIB are the Information
Infrastructure Protection Centre, followed by
state cyber police stations and the Computer
Followed by state sectoral-level CERTS. Many
of the states are actively considering setting up
cyber police stations and cyber labs.
The NIB has entrusted the National Security
Council Secretariat (NSCS) with the role of
working on cyberspace security. Again the
(NISCC) within its organisation is there to
provide necessary inputs to NIB for its
functioning.
The role of the DIT under NOCIT is also
significant. It acts as the public interface of the
government with the general public and the
international community as far as IT Policies in
India is concerned. The DIT’s role in the internet
governance efforts of the UN is also laudatory,
as it has also stressed the need for securing the
cyberspace. Some of the relevant initiatives and
strategies of DIT over the years have been:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Promotion of the internet and provision
of IT infrastructure.</li>
        <li>Development of the IT Act legislation and
the proposed amendments.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Computer Emergency Response Team</i></strong></div>

The Indian Computer Emergency Response
Team (CERT-In) is a government-mandated
information technology (IT) security
organization. The purpose of CERT-In is to
respond to computer security incidents, report
on vulnerabilities and promote effective IT
security practices throughout the country. CERTIn was created by the Indian Department of
Information Technology in 2004 and operates
under the auspices of that department.
According to the provisions of the
Information Technology Amendment Act 2008,
CERT-In is responsible for overseeing
administration of the Act. Basically CERT is a
normative term and it is based everywhere. For
India it is called as CERT-In. CERT organizations
throughout the world are independent entities,
although there may be coordinated activites
among groups. The first CERT group was formed
in the United States at Carnegie Mellon
University.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Computer Immunology</i></strong></div>

On a microscopic scale, biology resembles
computing: bases and genes correspond to bits
and bytes, based on certain rules. Conversely,
on a macroscopic scale, computing resembles
biology: the internet is like a vast ecosystem
where all kinds of digital organisms thrive.
The application of computing in biology, in
the genome era, is well known. There is, however,
traffic in the other direction as well. A US digital
security company, Sana Security of San Mateo,
California, has devised a way to use
immunological principles to spot computer
security breaches. Sana’s idea is based on the
ability to mimic the natural immune systems to
differentiate “self” from “non-self”.
Once installed, the Sana system monitors the
behaviour of specific programs running on a
computer, such as remote - login, web, mail and
database servers. Most attacks take advantage
of the flaw in these programs to gain 
unauthorized access to a computer over the course of a
day a so, the Sana’s Primary Response builds up
a profile of “normal” activity by looking at the
patterns of system cells, just as an immune system
builds up a profile of “self”.
<br>
<br>
Any significant deviation from this profile is
then regarded as an attack. When an attack is
detected, Primary Response can block all file
access associated with the program under attack
and prevent new programs from being launched.
In addition, it also gathers forensic data, such as
file-access details to work out what happened.
This approach has many advantages.
Intrusion - detection system, the popular
alternative to primary response, have a
reputation of crying wolf. They generate, for
instance, thousands of alerts every month. In
that event, it is indeed difficult to distinguish a
genuine attack from a false alarm. In contrast,
Primary Response tends to generate only a
handful of false alarms a month. The other
advantage is that Primary Response is not
“knowledge based”. That is, it does not rely on
assumptions about the nature of an attack. It
works by distinguishing normal “self” from
abnormal “non-self” behaviour.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONICS &
COMPUTER NETWORK IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

Electronics System: The manufacture of
radio receivers in the early 1950s heralded the
beginning of electronics industry in India. Since
then considerable progress has been made and
the industry’s range now extends from
manufacture of consumer and professional
grade electronic components to the design and
development of sophisticated equipment for
aerospace and defence applications.
The country is now gearing itself to meet the
challenge of the electronics revolution during the
rest of the decade. From a predominantly
consumer oriented industry electronics had
diversified to include advanced systems
governing computers, controls and
instrumentation besides telecommunication
using advanced technology in integrated circuits.
<br>
<br>
The country entered the Large Scale
Integrated (LSI) circuits/ Very Large Scale
Integrated (VLSI) circuits’ era in March 1984
with the trial production of the pulse dialer chip
by the public sector Semiconductor Complex
Limited (SCL). With an outlay of Rs 500 million
the plant has contemporary facilities to fabricate
the latest types of silicon chips.
In the longer perspective the task force on
LSI/VLSI had formulated as a goal the need to
achieve one-micron capability of research and
development to enable the fabrication of one
million components of a chip by 1990. The major
elements of this programme include the setting
up of a centre of excellence to provide a major
thrust in research on process technology
establishing a number of decentralized design
centres both to implement the silicon foundry
concept and to develop Computer Aided Design
(CAD) facilities for VLSI.
The state-owned, Bharat Electronics Limited
(BEL), which produced the integrated circuits
in 1971, has manufactured over 50 types of
bipolar ICS so far. These include 20 types of TTL
version and the remaining the linear type for
application in TV, AM/FM radio, multiplexing
applications and voltage regulators, besides, it
has fabricated a prototype watch chip with LSI
capability while BEL has a vertical integrated
facility covering design mask making wafer
fabrication assembly and testing up to the level
of MSI. SCL is building up a comprehensive
production level and R & D base up to the level
LSIs/VLSIs.
<br>
<br>
Besides there are several other organisations
in the industrial and R & D sectors having
strengths of various degrees in some or all
segments of the technology. These include
Central Electronics Engineering Research
Institute at Pilani, Tata Institute of Fundamental
research, Bombay and Indian Telephone
Industries, Bangalore. In the academic sector,
Indian Institute of Technology at Bombay, Delhi,
Kanpur, Kharagpur and Madras have got fairly
extensive facilities.
Computer Systems: As regards computer
systems, the state owned Electronics Corporation
of India Limited (ECIL) has made a significant
contribution in manufacturing computer systems
for example, 332 bit computer system. 332 has
been developed and manufactured indigenously.
ECIL has also demonstrated the system for its
remote graphic capability. The company has
“developed special purpose hardware and
software for a number of applications such as
telephone directory enquiry, airlines flight data
recording, criminal report generation of police
and message switching.
<br>
<br>
Recognizing the important role of telemetric
and allied technologies which provide means for
communication with the masses the Government
has set up a “Centre for Development of
Telematics” (C-DOT) to develop digital electronic
switching systems.
<br>
<br>
<b>NICNET:</b> As a forerunner the Electronics
Department has taken up a project on teletext
in cooperation with the Ministry of information
and Broadcasting. Through this network certain
information of public relevance are to be
transmitted along with Doordarshan
transmission. The software required for data
creation updating and maintenance is being
developed by the National Information Centre
(NIC) of the Department of Electronics on an
indigenous Computer. NIC provides computer
based management information system services
and related support facilities to various ministries,
departments and other offices of the
government. It has developed a star-type
computer network (NICNET) which links up 16
micro-computers and 20 interactive terminals
located in different offices in Delhi. The CDC
Cyber 170/730 system procured with assistance
from UNDP serves as the central node of this
network. The NIC Computer system is now
operational round the clock.
<br>
<br>
For the first time in the country the NIC has
developed computerized information based on
bibliographic data available from the
International Patent Documentation Centre
(INPADOC), Vienna. The system creates
information and multiplied index directory files
which facilitate faster and efficient retrieval of
patent documents according to the International
Patent classification code, date and year of
publication and title of the document. These
bibliographic information can be obtained
interactively or in a batch mode.
In a step towards data processing NIC is
setting up the INDONET, which is an integrated
information management and distribution data
processing facility spanning the entire country.
Under the project a computer network is being
set up in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and
Hyderabad. It will provide local computing
facilities to small and medium sectors, highly
specialised software in areas of engineering
designs, structural analysis, and management
sciences. The professional organisation may share
this sophisticated diversified system for
developing software for export.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LATEST WORLD’S TRENDS</i></strong></div>

While Artificial Intelligence enthusiasts are
grappling with the problems of making
computers more intelligent and creative, what
has been happening to computer technology in
general? In the recent past, major thrust has been
in making computers smaller, cheaper and more
robust. Advances in microelectronics technology
have made it possible to achieve all these three
objectives at the same time.
<br>
<br>
It is quite clear that even the most user
friendly computer is at present so difficult to use
for most people. Our normal mode of interacting
with people involves a lot of hand waving. We
leave many things unsaid, taking advantage of
shared context and shared presuppositions. Life
would become impossible if instructing another
person requires specifying everything to the
minute detail, explicitly taking into account all
possible contingencies but this is precisely what
computers demand and what computer
programming is all about.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indian Scene</i></strong></div>

How has computer technology transformed
the Indian scene in the last few years? After a
confused, hesitant and uncertain start the
transformation has certainly speeded up and
become visible in the last decade. At one level,
there is the official view of what has been
achieved. At the level of ordinary person at least
a handful of computer applications have made
a visible and high impact. By far the most
important of these in undoubtedly the
computerization of railway reservation for the
more effluent, computerized air reservation and
computerization of checking formalities at the
airports have certainly made air-travel less of a
hassle. Most hotels have computerized their
operations. Sales computerization in
departmental stores and supermarkets are
rapidly becoming the norm. Postal services,
banks, hospitals, and government transaction
with the ordinary public are yet to transform
themselves significantly through the use of
information technology.
<br>
<br>
Information technology (that is the
integrated use of computers and communication) is the basic needed to support the
service sector. For the ordinary citizen
improvement of services of all kinds is an
essential pre-requisite to improving the quality
of life but it is a pity that purposeful beginning
made in the early 80’s to use information
technology to upgrade the quality of life in India
have been allowed to drift and languish for want
of committed government leadership.
India pioneers in innovations aimed at
making the lives of common people easier at an
affordable price and Aakash is the step in that
direction. Aakash world's cheapest internet
device was conceived under the Human
Resources and Development Ministry's National
Mission on Education through Information and
Communication Technology (NME-ICT) to
provide students a device that could be used as
an E-book reader, to access online streaming
course material and web based research. Under
NME-ICT, the government intends to deliver 10
million tablets to post-secondary students across
India. This is a bold step in popularising
computer interfaced science experiments in
India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TELECOMMUNICATION SECTOR FIBRE OPTICS</i></strong></div>

In the field of fibre optics, India is now poised
to become the first developing country to make
use of fibre optics-the new technology of
transmitting information with beams of light to
solve many problems being faced in
telecommunications industry and medicine.
It is a new technology that has enormously
increased man’s capacity to move words,
pictures and data from place to place. Simply,
telephone conversations, television broadcasts,
computer data or any other message can be
translated into light wave and sent through glass
wires instead of the conventional technique of
translating them into electrical impulses and
sending them through copper wires. The
information, transmitted through optical fibres,
is in digital form as pulses of light. Tiny strands
of very pure glass, as thin as a human hair, can
carry up to 8000 simultaneous telephone calls
in a core just 1/200 millimetre across.
Fibre optics is the use of very fine transparent
fibres of glass with the purpose of transmitting
light. Light passes along the fibres by a series of
total internal reflections. In fact, it is a system
for transmitting light through hair flexible rods
(i.e., fibres) made of transparent glass or plastic.
Applications: One familiar use of the fibre
is in ornamental displays (i.e., lighting trees), but
more important is their use in examining interior
organs of the body and as economical substitutes
for telephone cables.
<br>
<br>
Medical instruments using fibre optics are
named according to the part of the body they
are designed to examine, e.g., bronchoscope
(bronchial tubes), cystoscope (bladder),
gastroscope (stomach), and sigmoidoscope
(lower large intestine). In all of these, a bundle
of fibres transmit light from an outside lamp to
illuminate the part of the body being examined.
Another bundle of several thousand fibres has
an objective lens at one end and an eyepiece lens
at the other. The objective lens forms an image
of the body part. This image is transmitted, point
by point, through the fibres to the eyepiece lens,
which magnifies the image.
For telephone cables, glass fibres are used in
place of copper wires. A pair of hair-thin glass
fibres can carry several thousand conversations
at one time, replacing several hundred wires
within a cable-an enormous saving in space and
money. The telephone message, first converted
by a laser apparatus from electrical currents to
pulses of light are transmitted through the glass
fibre, and are then converted back to electrical
form at the far end. There they are sorted out
and sent on to their receiving destinations. Glass
fibres are also used for high-density phone lines
between major cities and for cross-channel
cables. Since glass fibre is electrically a nonconductor, it is not affected by electromagnetic
interference. They can be used in high explosives
as well as high-voltage environment as they are
immune to thunderstorms, lightning or large
electrical motors.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Photonic Band Gap making a Revolution</i></strong></div>

A team of scientists in the United Kingdom
developed a revolutionary super-effective optical
fibre that guides the light through a central hole,
which can dramatically upgrade the powercarrying capacity of optical fibres into the multikilowatt region. This fibre technology is the
world’s first multi-kilowatt single mode fibre.
Till now, a solid optical fibre can carry limited
raw laser power and at very high power, the
glass simply cannot cope with the intense fields
and is torn apart. However, with the
development of new optical fibres having a large
hole in the middle that potentially permits the
transmission of huge amounts of energy, the
problem has been solved. Traditionally, optical
fibres carry light through a glass core covered
by a cladding which prevents the light from
leaking out.
<br>
<br>
In recent years, two new types of optical
fibres have revolutionised this dynamic field,
bringing with them a wide range of novel optical
properties. These new fibres, known collectively
as microstructured fibres, can be made entirely
from one type of glass as they do not rely on
dopants for guidance. Instead, the cladding
region is peppered with many small air holes,
that run the entire fibre length. These fibres are
typically separated into two classes, defined by
the way in which they guide light:
n Holey fibres, in which the core is solid
and light is guided by a modified form of
total internal reflection as the air holes
lower the effective refractive index of the
cladding relative to that of the solid core.
n Photonic band-gap fibres, in which
guidance in a hollow core can be achieved
via photonic band-gap effects.
<br>
<br>
<b>Optical-fibres in India:</b> In India, over 22
research institutions are engaged in various
system aspects of optical fibres, communication
fibres and associated material technology. The
Telecommunication Research Centre in Delhi
has developed terminal equipment for a 120-
telephone channel system. The Centre for
Development of Telematics (C-DOT) has
developed a 128-line digital switching system.
The Indian Institute of Technology, New
Delhi has a facility for testing fibres and engaged
in perfecting already existing measurement
techniques and trying to develop new methods
to characterise fibres (pulse dispersion, refractive
index, profile measurement, etc.)
The Defence Solid State Physics Laboratory,
Delhi has succeeded in fabricating the galliumarsenide lasers, while CSIO is developing a
machine for drawing plastic-coated silica fibres.
Research and development, and measurement technique related to characterisation and
evaluation of communication grade fibre are
being done at the Indian Institute of Technology,
Delhi, and Central Scientific Instrument
Organisation (CSIO), Chandigarh. Research in
the field of launching optical signals and
detection of signals with imported sources is
going on in several institutions of the country.
In India, the first optical fibre communication
system was set up in Pune, connecting Shivaji
Nagar and Cantonment Exchanges. Buried two
metres underground, the glass fibre imported
from Japan provided 120 telephone channels and
has been functioning without any fault since
1979. The Hindustan Cables Ltd. has started
manufacture of optic fibre cables at its Naini,
factory in Allahabad.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Optical Fibre Network</i></strong></div>

<b>The Department of Telecommunications
(DoT)</b> on July 22, 2011 cleared creation of a
‘National Optical Fibre Network' (NOFN) with
an investment of Rs.20,000 crore that would
provide broadband connectivity to all village
panchayats in three years. The Telecom
Commission has approved the project that will
be funded through the Universal Service
Obligation (USO) Fund. The project will be
completed by 2014-15 through a special purpose
vehicle (SPV). The funding for the broadband
network will come from the USO fund, the USO
fund has a balance of Rs 16,000 crore.
NFON will also help the government
implement its various e-governance initiatives
such as e-health, e-banking and e-education,
facilitating inclusive growth. NOFN will enable
effective and faster implementation of various
mission mode e-governance projects amounting
to Rs.50,000 crore initiated by the Department
of Information Technology as well as delivery of
a whole range of electronic services by the private
sector to citizens in rural areas.
Once completed, the optic fibre network will
help bring various electronic and Internet-based
initiatives of the government to the people living
in the remotest corner of the country. The
broadband project will initially be executed by
Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and other PSUs
like RailTel.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bharat Broadband Network Limited
(BBNL)</b> was established in pursuit of a high-level
policy declaration of ‘broadband for all’ by the
central government in 2009. BBNL would
implement National Optical Fibre Network
(NOFN), which is expected to open up the
gateway to rural development, by facilitating
implementation of the e-Government projects in
the social sectors like education, health, social
security, employment guarantee, financial and
banking services, all fostering inclusive growth
for rural India. It is further expected that this
would also provide a great fillip to private sector
for providing other services in the remote places
on a viable business model which is hitherto nonexistent.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Global Market</i></strong></div>

The global optical cable market posted 10 per
cent growth in 2012 with a stronger growth
forecasted in 2013. China now accounts for half
of global cabled-fibre deployments. The massive
cable deployments in China's FTTx projects and
wireless infrastructure were key drivers in the
global cable market's double-digit growth last
year. Other markets, Europe and North
America, saw a decline in growth due to
ongoing economic uncertainty and the spending
cycles for publicly financed broadband network
projects. Nevertheless, world optical cable
demand increased to 235 million fibre-km in
2012. China's growth in 2012 was approximately
20 per cent, and the forecast is for comparable
growth this year. Australia, India, Mexico,
Russia, and South Africa are other key markets
poised for 2013 growth. Fibre-to-the-Premises
(FTTP), Fibre-to-the-Home (FTTH), and 
Fibre-tothe-Building (FTTB) applications are some of the
key factors driving the demand for fibre optic
cables industry worldwide.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GPON Technology</i></strong></div>

In a move that would give the much-needed
push to broadband penetration in the country,
the Centre for Development of Telematics (CDoT) recently transferred indigenouslydeveloped Gigabit Passive Optical Network
(GPON) technology to seven telecom equipment
manufacturers, including private players. The
GPON technology is a pivotal component
required for broadband connectivity over optical
fibre.
<br>
<br>
The cost-effective GPON will prove to be a
game-changer technology for India. It can be
used to provide triple play (voice, video and
data). The present GPON standards specify 2.5
Gbps (Gigabit per second) downstream and 1.25
Gbps upstream data capability to customer
premise. Apart from urban areas, especially
multi-dwelling units, the large data carrying
capability is important for Indian villages too
where prevailing low literacy levels will
necessitate information with greater graphic and
audio content for better dissemination. It will
give a boost to broadband connectivity across
India.
<br>
<br>
Besides, voice telephony, high speed Internet
access and IPTV, the C-DOT GPON has
provision to carry cable TV signal too, all on a
single optical fibre. Another important
advantage of GPON is that it can carry
information from a central office to subscribers
up to 60 km away without needing any
intermediate repeaters thus doing away with the
requirement of power, shelter and upkeep
services at the intermediate locations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WI-MAX TECHNOLOGY</i></strong></div>

A new wireless technology, Wimax, can cost
effectively bring high speed internet services to
rural areas. With backers like Intel Corporation
and Fujitsu, the technology is promising. But
Indian companies seem to be intent on
introducing the technology in only urban
markets.
Advantage: Telecommunication companies
have always said that it is too expensive to lay
high-speed internet cables in villages because the
profits are much lesser than the expenses. Both
Wimax and its processor wi-fi use radio waves
to broadcast internet signals, thus removing the
need to use cables. Whereas wi-fi could only
broadcast signals upto a hundred metres away
from the transmission towers, Wimax technology
can transmit signals upto three kilometers away
and it supports speeds five times faster than what
its counterpart (wi-fi) does.
Wimax Forum: Reliance Infocomm Limited,
Sify Limited and Tata Teleservices Limited - the
leading telecom players of India are part of the
Wimax Forum, a global consortium of
companies involved in promoting the
technology. These companies are planning to
start pilot trials of Wimax in India very soon.
Utility: A few companies, such as Chennai
based n-Logue Communications Private Limited,
have endeavoured to bring in the information
revolution to rural India. N-Logue has set up
kiosks providing Internet services in several
villages of Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil
Nadu; villages have used this service to get
medical consultations and establish a link with
agricultural experts. More such projects are
required to make the villagers realise the benefits
of the Internet, thereby generating demand.
Experts hope that rural India might make it to
the telecommunication industry’s agenda by
2005, when Wimax will be launched in the
market.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WIFI</i></strong></div>

WiFi stands for the wireless fidelity, is a
wireless networking technology used across the
globe. WiFi became very popular because once
base station is there, any number of desktops or
laptop computers can be connected to broadband
service without the need of any cables or
installing extra phone lines. It mainly refers to
using radio frequencies and/ or infrared waves.
The main purpose of Wi-Fi is to hide
complexity by enabling wireless access to
applications and data, media and streams.
The main advantages of the Wi-Fi are :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Make access to information easier.</li>
        <li>Ensure compatibility and co-existence of device.</li>
        <li>Eliminate cabling and wiring.</li>
        <li>Eliminate switches, adapters, plugs, pins and connectors.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

It allows LANs (Local Area Networks) to be
deployed without cabling for client devices,
typically reducing the costs of network
deployment and expansion. Space where cables
cannot be run, such as outdoor areas and
historical buildings, can host wireless LANs.
A Wi-Fi enabled device such as a PC, game
console, mobile phone, MP3 player or PDA can
connect to the Internet when within range of a
wireless network connected to the Internet. The
coverage of one or more interconnected access
points called a hotspot can comprise an area as
small as a single room with wireless-opaque
walls or as large as many square miles covered
by overlapping access points. Wi-Fi technology
has served to set up mesh networks.
<br>
<br>
In addition to restricted use in homes and
offices, Wi-Fi can make access publicly available
at Wi-Fi hotspots provided either free of charge
or to subscribers to various providers.
Organizations and businesses such as airports,
hotels and restaurants often provide free
hotspots to attract or assist clients. Enthusiasts
or authorities who wish to provide services or
even to promote business in a given area
sometimes provide free Wi-Fi access.
Wi-Fi also allows connectivity in peer-to-peer
(wireless ad-hoc network) mode, which enables
devices to connect directly with each other. This
connectivity mode can prove useful in consumer
electronics and gaming applications.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Comparison with Wi-Fi</i></strong></div>

WiMAX provides services analogous to a
cellphone, Wi-Fi is more analogous to a cordless
phone. Wi-Fi is a shorter range system, typically
hundreds of metres, generally used by an end
user to access their own network. Wi-Fi is low
cost and is generally used to provide Internet
access within a single room or building. For
example, many coffee shops, hotels, railway
stations and bus stations contain Wi-Fi access
points providing access to the Internet for
customers.
<br>
<br>
Wireless Routers which incorporate a DSLmodem or a cable-modem and a Wi-Fi access
point, often set up in homes to provide Internetaccess and inter-networking to all devices
connected (wirelessly or by cable) to them. One
can also connect Wi-Fi devices in ad-hoc mode
for client-to-client connections without a router.
Wi-Fi allows LANs to be deployed without
cabling for client devices, typically reducing the
costs of network deployment and expansion.
Wireless network adapters are also built into
most modern laptops.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BI-FI</i></strong></div>

Recently, researchers from Stanford
University are harnessing the key attributes of a
virus 'M13' to develop the first biological Internet
or 'Bi-Fi' by creating a mechanism to send genetic
messages from cell to cell. The system greatly
increases the complexity and amount of data that
can be communicated between cells and could
lead to greater control of biological functions
within cell communities. Bio-engineering
researchers have parasitised the parasite and
harnessed M13's key attributes — its nonlethality and its ability to package and broadcast
arbitrary DNA strands — to create the biological
Internet or 'Bi-Fi'.
<br>
<br>
The Stanford University revealed that
Biological Internet could lead to biosynthetic
factories in which huge masses of microbes
collaborate to make more complicated fuels,
pharmaceuticals and other useful chemicals,
including the regeneration of tissue or organs in
future.
The virus 'M13' is a package of genetic
messages. It reproduces within its host, taking
strands of DNA - strands that engineers can
control - wrapping them up one by one and
sending them out encapsulated within proteins
produced by M13 that can infect other cells. The
M13-based system is essentially a communication
channel. It acts like a wireless Internet connection
that enables cells to send or receive messages,
but it does not care what secrets the transmitted
messages contain.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BROADBAND</i></strong></div>

Broadband could be defined as an always
on connection that is able to support various
interactive services and has the capability of a
minimum download speed of 256 kbps or
kilobits per second. High-speed internet is also
commonly called broadband internet. To put that
in context, an average telephone line through
which we dial into the internet theoretically gives
a speed of 33.3 kbps, though actual speeds may
be far lesser. An affordable broadband access to
the Net would allow a PC to be used as a TV/
music system. One can watch a downloaded
movie or listen to an older-goldie track or merely
get the latest quotes for one’s stock portfolio.
The major types of broadband include DSL,
cable, satellite, fibre-optic and mobile broadband.
DSL: Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) is
broadband internet delivered over copper phone
wires. The lines are split into two frequencies:
one for data and one for voice. Traditional DSL
speeds range from 768 Kbps to as fast as 7 Mbps-
-but must be located within 2 miles of the phone
company's central office for optimal speed.
Fibre: Fiber-optic broadband is a broadband
internet delivered over fibre-optic lines--these use
light to transmit data signals at far faster speeds
than traditional copper wires or coaxial cables.
Cable: Cable broadband internet delivers
data at broadband speeds over the same cable
used to deliver television data. Basic cable
internet speeds range from 6 Mbps to 18 Mbps,
while more advanced cable internet can reach
speeds of 75 Mbps and more. Cable Internet
speeds can be affected by users within the same
vicinity using the same cable connection.
Satellite: Satellite broadband uses orbiting
satellites to transmit and receive broadband data.
Satellite broadband is primarily used in areas
where terrestrial broadband technologies like
DSL, fibre and cable are otherwise unavailable.
Speeds for satellite broadband are comparable
to traditional DSL, ranging from 768 kbps to 5
Mbps--but data speeds can be affected by
changes in the weather and satellite position.
Mobile Broadband: Mobile networks are a
wireless broadband technology accessible via
3G/4G/LTE enabled cellphones and smart
devices like ebook readers. Speed differs between
carriers and can be affected by user location and
carrier coverage. The fastest wireless technology,
LTE, offers maximum theoretical download
speeds of up to 150 Mbps.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORKS (WLANS)</i></strong></div>

A wireless LAN is a flexible data communication system implemented as an extension to,
or as an alternative for, a wired LAN within a
building or campus. Using electromagnetic
waves, WLANs transmit and receive data over
the air, minimising the need for wired
connections. Thus, WLANs combine data
connectivity with user mobility, and through
simplified configuration enable movable LANs.
Wireless LANs frequently augment rather
than replace wired LAN networks - often
providing the final few metres of connectivity
between a backbone network and the mobile
user. The power and flexibility of wireless LANs
finds applications both in the office as well as in
home environments. It can also be used in
consulting and sales, manufacturing and
warehousing, corporate office, retail
applications, education and research, trading
and banking and also healthcare.
<br>
<br>
Benefits of wireless LANs over traditional
wired network:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobility</li>
        <li>Installation speed and simplicity</li>
        <li>Installation flexibility</li>

‘3G’ MOBILE TECHNOLOGY
‘3G’ or bugs free third generation cellular
technology will satisfy all ‘bandwidth-hungry
applications’ such as full-motion video, video
salient conferencing and full Internet access.</li>
        <li>The major advance in 3G systems is
moving from speech and low rate data
transmission to medium and high speed
data for video (TV) transmission and
Internet searching.</li>
        <li>The 3G mobile systems will increase the
data rate by 200 times.</li>
        <li>They will improve audio quality, marking
a total change in telephone usage from
exclusively voice to predominantly data
services.</li>
        <li>A 3G user can see the other user on his
display screen.</li>
        <li>While transmitting video images and data,
the user need simply push a button to
talk with image receiver.</li>
        <li>Film clips can be seen clearly and
instantly.</li>
        <li>There is hardly any jumping or slow
motion display.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In Europe, the US and most parts of Asia
are embracing 3G technologies but in India it is
in initial stage and some telecom operators are
providing the 3G services. After more than eight
years of wireless usage, the country still does not
have a clear-cut policy for allocating frequencies,
a vital element in the introduction of any wireless
technology. The World Bank recognised India’s
lack of progress in this regard and forked out a
huge grant to modernise the frequency allocation
systems. Progress is taking place but at a slow
pace.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>4G TECHNOLOGY</i></strong></div>

4G is the fourth-generation cellular
communication system that operates on Internet
technology using various wired and wireless
networks. It combines applications and
technologies like Wi-Fi and WiMax, so that
highest throughput and lowest cost wireless
network is possible, providing high quality, high
security and any kind of services, anytime,
anywhere to the users. In simple language, it
provides MMS, multimedia and video
applications in mobile or wireless format. The
main features of 4G are:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The 4G technology is to provide interactive
services like video conferencing, Wireless
Internet, Multimedia Messaging service,
Video chat, mobile TV, High definition TV
content and needless to say, voice and
data services, anytime and anywhere.</li>
        <li>There will be high network capacity, high
speed data transfer rate at any two points
in the world, seamless connectivity and
global roaming.</li>
        <li>No new infrastructure is needed to be
installed, as 4G will be interoperable with
existing wireless standards, dynamically
sharing and utilizing the already existing
network resource.</li>
        <li>It will have the feature of smelling the
background of the other person on the
phone. If someone is cooking something
and he/she wants you to smell it, he/she
would be able to do that.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>How 4G Works?</i></strong></div>

4G wireless networks use two types of
addresses for communication between two
devices, for example a computer and a cell
phone. Each node will be assigned a 4G-IP
(Internet Protocol) address, which will be formed
by a permanent home IP address and a dynamic
care-of address that will represent the phone’s
actual location. When a computer using Internet
wants to communicate with a cell phone in the
wireless network, the computer will send a
packet to the 4G-IP address of the cell phone.
Then a directory server on the cell phone’s home
network will forward this packet to the cell
phone’s care-of address through a mobile IP. The
directory server will also inform the computer
of the cell phone’s care-of address (the real
location), so that the next packet can be sent to
the cell phone directly.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Benefits of 4G</i></strong></div>

The advanced applications of 4G systems will
primarily be location-based services. 4G location
applications would utilize visualized, virtual
navigation schemes that would support a remote
database containing graphical representations of
streets, buildings and other physical
characteristics of a large area. Thus, the benefits
will include:
<br>
Tele-geoprocessing: It is a combination of
Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and
Global Positioning Systems (GPS), working
together in a high-capacity wireless mobile
system. Using this, public safety will be enhanced
by reading the environment of even a remote
place and understanding the problems of the
concerned area.
<br>
Virtual Navigation: The database can be
accessed by a subscriber in a moving vehicle
equipped with the appropriate wireless device,
to know about the roads and locations in
advance.
<br>
Tele-medicine: A paramedic assisting a
victim of a traffic accident in a remote location
would be able to access medical records (eg. xray sheet) and establish a video conference so
that a remotely-based surgeon could provide
“on-scene” assistance.
<br>
Crisis-management Applications: In case of
natural disasters, where the entire
communications infrastructure is in disarray,
restoring communication quickly will be
essential. Using 4G both limited and complete
communication capabilities, including Internet
and video services, would be set up in a matter
of hours.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bluetooth Technology</i></strong></div>

Bluetooth is a short range, wire free, secure
and international standardized wireless
technology that provides wireless
communication system between the Bluetooth
enabled devices in a short ranged network.
Bluetooth technology is a short range wireless
technology that was developed by the
collaboration of mobile phones and IT companies
such as Nokia, Intel, Toshiba, Ericsson and IBM.
Bluetooth develops short range wireless
connections between the laptops, handheld PCs,
wireless communication devices and mobile
phones. Bluetooth is only available to the
personal area networks in an office or a home
network. It reduces the usage of power as
compared to the Wi-Fi. Bluetooth is an
international standardized technology that is
used for the wireless communication between
the Bluetooth held devices such as mobile phones,
digital camera, laptops, desktop computers,
keyboard, mouse, MP3 players, video cameras
and other devices.
<br>
<br>
Bluetooth is free technology and it is
provided by the mobile phone operators who are
having the capability of GSM and CDMA
technology. Bluetooth uses radio-waves
frequency as a medium and is suitable for the 1,
10 and 100 metres distance. Every Bluetooth
enabled device such as mobile phones, laptops,
digital cameras; video games consoles have builtin microchip.
Bluetooth uses radio-waves that operate at
2.4 GHz bands. The personal computers must
have built-in dongle in them to use the Bluetooth
technology. Bluetooth is also used to transfer the
files from the mobile phones or PDA devices to
the computers. Also, in a meeting if you want to
share the digital business cards among the
participants of the meeting you use Bluetooth to
transfer the files. Microsoft Windows XP with
the service pack 2 has the built-in support for
the Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth defines the
wireless standards to maintain the secure data
communication.
<br>
<br>
The master Bluetooth device can
communication with the seven other Bluetooth
enabled devices. Different devices support
different standards of the Bluetooth technology.
The research on the advanced Bluetooth is in
progress for the Bluetooth version 3.0 to provide
the high speed connections.
Bluetooth technology also provides support
for the VOIP technology. The Bluetooth headset
provides the wireless extension to the Bluetooth
device. A typical Bluetooth device consist of RS
transceiver, protocol stacks and base bands and
it does not require to install the additional drivers
to use the Bluetooth technology and it can
connect all the office peripheral such as
computer with printer, computer with scanner
and computer with laptop. Among the other
advantages of the Bluetooth technology is the
automatic synchronization of the desktops,
mobile phones and other Bluetooth held devices.
Another popular use of the Bluetooth is in the
cars and automotives. The most commonly
Bluetooth held devices are mobile phones,
personal computers, laptops, headsets, access
points, car kits, speaker phone, streaming video,
MP3 players, SIM cards, Push-2-talk, PDA and
digital camera.
<br>
<br>
By this technology, mobile data can be used
in the different applications. It provides the speed
of 1-2 Mbps. Bluetooth’s small microchip can be
built in the devices and it can also be used as the
external adapters and used for the different
network commu-nication devices. Bluetooth
enabled devices can change their frequency very
rapidly so they can be saved from the external
interference. Bluetooth enabled devices have built
in security features and they use pin code and
128 encryption. If the two wireless devices follow
the Bluetooth standards they can communicate
with each other without any external devices or
wires. More enhancements are in progress in this
technology to provide the most robust, state-ofthe-art, high speed and secure connections to the
mobile users.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Applications of Bluetooth:</i></strong></div>

n Wireless control and communication
between a mobile phone and a handsfree headset.
n Wireless networking between PCs in a

n Two seventh-generation game consoles,
Nintendo’s Wii and Sony’s PlayStation 3,
use Bluetooth for their respective wireless
controllers.
n Dial-up internet access on personal
computers or PDAs using a data-capable
mobile phone as a modem.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CDMA</i></strong></div>

Code division multiple access (CDMA) is a
channel access method utilized by various radio
communication technologies. It should not be
confused with the mobile phone standards called
CDMA 1 and CDMA2000 (which are often
referred to as simply “CDMA”), which use
CDMA as an underlying channel access method.
One of the basic concepts in data
communication is the idea of allowing several
transmitters to send information simultaneously
over a single communication channel. This
allows several users to share a bandwidth of
different frequencies. This concept is called
multiplexing. CDMA employs spread-spectrum
technology and a special coding scheme (where
each transmitter is assigned a code) to allow
multiple users to be multiplexed over the same
physical channel. By contrast, time division
multiple access (TDMA) divides access by time,
while frequency-division multiple access
(FDMA) divides it by frequency. CDMA is a form
of “spread-spectrum” signalling, since the
modulated coded signal has a much higher data
bandwidth than the data being communicated.
An analogy to the problem of multiple access
is a room (channel) in which people wish to
communicate with each other. To avoid
confusion, people could take turns speaking (time
division), speak at different pitches (frequency
division), or speak in different languages (code
division). CDMA is analogous to the last example
where people speaking the same language can
understand each other, but not other people.
Similarly, in radio CDMA, each group of users
is given a shared code. Many codes occupy the
same channel, but only users associated with a
particular code can understand each other.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TELECOM SERVICES IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

In the field of communications, from
essentially a telegraph network in late forties, the
Indian telecommunication network facility has
grown significantly over the years with the
acquisition, adaptation and indigenous
development of newer technologies.
The country has now developed the
necessary capability to manufacture her own
sophisticated materials and equipment, for
example, telephone instruments, digital
telephones, key telephones and microwave and
line systems. The major areas in the plan of
Indian Telephone Industries (ITI) relate to digital
telephone subscriber apparatus and
instrumentation, telemetrics and powerline
carrier communication systems, and integrated
communication systems.
Today, the network provides for nationwide
dialing, enabling speech transmission, long
distance links through satellites and fairly
efficient switching systems like the electronic
stored programme controlled (SPC) switching
systems.
<br>
<br>
The ITI is the main national organisation
providing hardware for the network. Specialised
communication equipment needed for defence,
power administration, railways, ONGC, and
other organisations are met by ITI, BEL and ECIL.
Even remote towns can be connected to the
national telephone network with the help of the
most advanced digital integrated local-cumtrunk exchange developed by the ITI, Bangalore
in collaboration with the TRC.
Computers in Telecom Services:
Computers have been introduced to modernise
business and consumer services in the large
telephone system. The first phase of the project
in operation involved ‘directory enquiry service’.
The facility is being extended to cover commercial
billing fault analysis and fault control traffic
accounts.
<br>
<br>
The National Centre for Software
Development and Computing Techniques
(NCSDCT) in Mumbai has provided the R &D
and human resources base for Indian software
development and exports.
Inmarsat: It stands for International
Maritime Satellite founded in 1979. INMARSAT
organisation has more than 80 countries as its
members with London as its headquarters that
provides worldwide satellite communications for
maritime, aeronautical and mobile land users.
INMARSAT operates a satellite each in the
Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean region. The
Vikram Land Earth Station, which was
commissioned on May 31, 1992 at Arvi, about
85 km from Pune and became operational on
July 11, 1992, is the 37th such station in the
INMARSAT family. Besides the satellites and the
land earth stations (LES), the INMARSAT system
also has mobile earth stations with the satellite
communications terminals located on ships,
trucks, etc. The Vikram LES is providing shoreto-ship and ship-to-shore telephone, telex, fax,
etc. Maritime INMARSAT terminals have a
special feature that automatically generates and
sends distress messages to rescue coordination
centres.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COMMUNICATION AND BROADCASTING</i></strong></div>

Under the liberalised licensing regime, the
whole area of telecom and broadcasting
equipment was delicensed and emphasis was
given to promotional activities for attracting
foreign investments, exports, private telecom
network, decentralization of telecom services,
and technology development. These measures
are expected to bring a sea change in national
telecommunication scenario and make India
internationally competitive. On July 16, 2013, the
Union Government decided to liberalise the
foreign direct investment (FDI) regime further.
In the telecom sector, FDI limit hiked under the
automatic route to 49 per cent and 49 to 100 per
cent under the FIPB route.
<br>
<br>
As a result of the liberalisation, a large
number of proposals were received from Indian
and foreign companies to manufacture switching
equipment, transmission equipment, and twoway radio communication equipment. Siemens,
Ericsson, and Fujitsu were selected for the
manufacture of large capacity digital exchanges.
To promote faster growth of telecom
services, a decision has been taken to allow State
Governments for setting up Telecom Networks
in the industrial estates with access to DoT lines.
Accordingly, State Governments are making
proposals to develop telecom infrastructure in
the States.
A number of new thrust areas and gap areas
were identified for development in telecom and
broadcasting sector. Electronics Development
and Research Centre (ERDC), Pune of the DoE
undertook the indigenous development of lowcost Amateur Radio, Citizen Band Radio and
Data Radio suitable for rural applications. There
are about 200 companies in the country
manufacturing telecom and broadcast
equipments.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL TELECOM POLICY 2012</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IPR IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

Major changes to Indian Copyright Law
were introduced in June 1994. This has made
the Indian Copyright law, one of the toughest
in the world. The amendments to the Copyright
Act in June 1994 included the definition of
Computer Program. The Copyright (Amendment) Act 1994, clearly explains the rights of
copyright holder, position on rentals of software,
the rights of the user to make backup copies and
the heavy punishment and fines on infringement
of copyright of software. At present officers of
these government agencies, NASSCOM officials,
police and various other law enforcement officers
of Government of India are committed to enforce
copyright laws and eradicate the menace of
software piracy. Raids jointly facilitated by
NASSCOM and Business Software Alliance with
active cooperation from law enforcing
authorities over last one year at some of the major
metro cities have already had salutary effect.
 To protect the intellectual property rights
(IPR) of software companies, apart from cracking
down on piracy, the government has also made
several policies to actively discourage piracy.
Authorized sellers of imported software are
allowed to reproduce software in India and sell
it without import duty. Local software
manufacturers are exempt from excise taxes.
Other incentives include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Depreciation on IT products allowed at
60% pa, taking into cognizance the high
rate of obsolescence of such products.</li>
        <li>Exemption of withholding tax on interest
on ECBs is proposed to be extended to
the IT sector as well. This will reduce cost
of borrowings for IT companies through
the ECB route.</li>
        <li>100% customs duty exemption on all
software used in the IT sector.</li>
        <li>Extension of 80HHE Tax benefit to the
supporting developers. This will enable
supporting developers to enjoy tax
concessions, similar to the supporting
manufacturer’s concept in manufacturing
sector.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The Copyright (Amendment) Act 2012
passed by Parliament has come into effect
declaring authors as owners of the copyright,
which cannot be assigned to the producers as
was the practice till now. It will now become
mandatory for broadcasters - both radio and
television - to pay royalty to the owners of the
copyright each time a work of art is broadcast.
It bans people from bringing out cover versions
of any literary, dramatic or musical work for five
years from the first recording of the original
creation. The law also seeks to remove
operational difficulties and address newer issues
related to the digital world.
<br>
<br>
<b>Limited Protection to Some Internet
Intermediaries:</b> There are two new provisions,
which provide some degree of protection to
'transient or incidental' storage of a work or
performance. Section 52(1)(b) allows for the
transient or incidental storage of a work or
performance purely in the technical process of
electronic transmission or communication to the
public, hence applying primarily to Internet
Service Providers (ISPs), VPN providers, etc.
Section 52(1)(c) allows for transient or incidental
storage of a work or performance for the
purpose of providing electronic links, access or
integration, where such links, access or
integration have not been expressly prohibited
by the right holder, unless the person responsible
is aware or has reasonable grounds for believing
that such storage is of an infringing copy. This
seems to make it applicable primarily to search
engines, with other kinds of online services being
covered or not covered depending on one’s
interpretation of the word 'incidental'.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COMPUTER FUNDAMENTALS</i></strong></div>

Computer is an electronic device that can
count, save and solve complex problems with
high accuracy and speed.
n Input: The source data entered into a data
processing system.
n Central Processing Unit: The Arithmetic
Logic Unit (ALU) and Control Unit (CU)
together are termed as the Central
Processing Unit. It is the brain of any
computer system. All calculations and
comparisons are made inside the CPU.
n Control Unit: The part of Central
Processing Unit which directs the
sequence of operating, interprets and
coded instruction and sees to the execution
of program instruction.
n Arithmetic Logic Unit: The part of CPU,
which performs the arithmetical and
logical operations.
n Storage: The storage or primary section
of computer consists of the devices used
to store the information. Example:
Magnetic cores, RAM chips, etc.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Output: The finished result of processing
by a system.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Classification of Computer</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Analog Computer: Computers that
measure physical quantities e.g. pressure,
temperature, voltage etc. They are used
mainly for scientific and engineering
purpose.</li>
        <li>Digital Computer: Computer that counts
and accepts letters and numbers through
various input devices. It can be used in
various applications.</li>
        <li>Hybrid Computer: The features of analog
and digital machines are combined to
create a hybrid computing system.</li>
        <li>Mainframe Computers: Computers with
high capability but less powerful and
cheaper than supercomputers. These are
suited for big organizations to manage
high volume of applications e.g. MEDHA,
Sperry DEC, IBM, HP, ICL etc.</li>
        <li>Mini Computers: Relatively fast and small
and inexpensive computer with somewhat
limited input/output capabilities. The first
popular minicomputer was the PDP-8,
launched in 1965.</li>
        <li>Micro Computers: Full-fledged computer
system that uses micro processor as their
CPU. These are also called personal
computer system.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Computer Devices</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
    <li>Input Devices: These are used for
transferring user command or data to the
computer. e.g.- Keyboard, Mouse, Light
pen etc.</li>
    <li>Keyboard: The keyboard is one of the
most common input device for computers.
The layout of the keyboard is like that of
the traditional QWERTY typewriter,
although there are some extra command
and function keys provided for.</li>
    <li>Mouse: Mouse is a handy device which
can be moved on a smooth surface to
simulate the movement of cursor that is
desired on the display screen.</li>
    <li>Light pen: This is a pen shaped pointing
device which can be used to select an
option by just pointing at it, or drawing
figures directly on the screen and moving
the figures around.</li>
    <li>Scanners: It facilitates capturing of the
information and storing them in graphic
format for displaying back on the
graphical screen.</li>
    <li>Output Devices: Peripherals used to
output results to the user. e.g.- Printers,
VDU (Visual Display Unit)</li>
    <li>Printers: Output devices are used to
produce hard copy of computer output
that is readable by humans.</li>
    <li>Ink Jet Printer: A printing device that
uses a nozzle and sprays ink into paper to
form the appropriate characters. The typing
speed range from 50 cps above 300 cps.</li>
    <li>Laser Printer: A very high speed printer
that uses a combination of laser beam and
electro-photographic techniques to create
printed outputs at a speed in excess of
13,000 lines per unit. Speed can range
from 10 pages a minute to about 200
pages per minute.</li>
    <li> Floppy Disk: Popular magnetic device for
small computer introduced by IBM in
1972. It is flexible and has a plastic jacket
coated with iron oxide material. Data and
information stores in the disks as a
magnetic and non-magnetic spots. It is a
non erasable disc used for storing
computer data.</li>
    <li>Programming Language: Computer
programming is the name given to the ‘art’
of writing a programme in a programming
language, which is a higher-level language.
In a binary-coded digital computer, the
machine language is made of Os and 1s to
relieve the programme in the difficult lowlevel machine language, several hundreds
of easier high level programming language
have been developed, such as, FORTRAN,
BASIC, COBOL, PASCAL, C, C++ etc.</li>
    <li>Memory: The data, which are stored in a
computer, are called its memory. A
computer’s memory has actually two
memories-one permanent, and the other
temporary.
<br>
<br>
(i) ROM (Read Only Memory): ROM is
permanent in nature. Neither you nor the
computer has any control over the
information in ROM. Here, the
manufacturer has placed special data that
can be used, but not erased or changed.
<br>
(ii) RAM (Random Access Memory): RAM
handles all input, each electronic switch
storing one bit. The more RAM a
computer has, the more information it can
store. However, it presents a special problemit works only as long as electric current
flows through it. Without a current, all
the stored information is wiped out.</li>
    <li>Speed: Computer speeds are measured in
terms of million instructions per second
(MIPS), which reflects the number of
instructions the processor at the heart of
computer can perform.</li>
    <li>Mass Storage: Information can be stored
permanently on magnetic tape on a floppy
disc, a thin flexible disc coated with
magnetic particles, or on a hard disc. These
media store bits (zeros and ones) as
magnetic strips running in either one
direction (signifying O) or the other
(signifying 1). Mass storage device can then
retrieve (read) the data, change it, and again
store (write) it onto tape or disc.</li>
    <li>IP Telephony: Internet Protocol Telephony
encompasses many different ways of
transmitting voice, fax and related services.
IP stands for low cost or even free voice
calls. On the other voice IP (Vo IP) is much
more than Internet Telephony for the core
network operators, local exchanges and
corporate enterprises.</li>
    <li>Global System for Mobile (GSM): The
Global System for Mobile (GSM) is a
worldwide dominant system that originally
evolved as a pan-European digital standard,
and built a base in the US and Canada at
a rapid pace. GSM uses Time Division
Multiple Access (TDMA). TDMA is not a
spread spectrum technology. It uses a
narrow band that is 30 KHZ wide and 6.7
milliseconds long. This is split times-wise
into slots. Each conversation gets the radio
for part of the time.</li>
    <li>Code-Division Multiple Accesses
(CDMA): The Code-Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) technology, also known as
digital mobile technology, came into the
picture after the entry of the GSM. CDMA,
due to its technological superiority, is
presently the biggest challenger to GSM. In
CDMA, the data is digitized and spread
over the entire available bandwidth, unlike
the narrow band of TDMA. Multiple calls
are overlaid on each other on the channel,
with each assigned a unique sequence code.
The data is then reassembled at the receiver’s
end. The battery life of CDMA handsets is
longer than that of analogue phones, with
a talk time of three to four hours, and up
to two-and-a-half weeks of standby time.</li>
    <li>Digital Signature: Digital Signature is extra
data appended to a message which identifies
and authenticates the sender and the data
using public key encryption. The signature
is issued by the control of certifying
authorities. Not many companies are willing
to apply for CA (certifying authority). The
government had stipulated that a CA
should have a minimum paid up capital of
Rs. 5 crore and a net worth of Rs. 50 crore.</li>
    <li>PAGING: It provides a one-way wireless
communication to the wandering users. In
this system, the messages are sent to the
subscribers, which consist of small receiver.</li>
    <li>Electronic Mail (E-Mail): E-mail involves
non-interactive communication of
information between the sender and a
receiver. The information may be in the form
of text or data image or voice message.</li>
    <li>FAX: Fascimile transfer of messages, i..e.,
FAX is used for transmission of weather
charts, engineering drawings, and even
handwritten notes.</li>
    <li>Voice Mail: If someone wants to enjoy the
benefits of a telephone, without actually
owning one, he should subscribe to voice
mail.</li>
    <li>Electronic Data Interchange (EDI): It
enables usually a customer and supplier to
exchange routine documents, such as,
purchase orders and invoices using standard
electronic forms and their own computers,
linked through a service provider.</li>
    <li>Video Conferencing: Video conferencing or
Electronic conferencing allows persons
sitting in different parts of the city, country
or world to meet face-to-face without
actually being there. This is possible with
the help of special cameras attached to
computers. The images are digitalised and
bounced to the place to a person’s choice
by means of a modem attached to the
computer.</li>
    <li>Video Tex: It is the generic name of systems
which transmit text and graphic information
stored in the computer database via the
telephone network for display on a
television screen. The user indicates the
information he would like from the database
and the computer sends it to the user.</li>
    <li>Virtual Reality: It enables a person to enter
the world to three-dimensional (3-D)
computer-aided image. It is not like any
computer graphic. In fact, it accords
multiple sensory information, sight, sound
and touch in an effort to make the situation
realistic.</li>
    <li>DTH Transmission: The Direct to Home
(DTH) services are all set to make an entry
in the Indian homes in the near future. In
DTH, the move from C-Band to Ku-Band
means that DTH providers would be in a
position to offer up to 100 channels. They
would also offer value-added services like
interactive media, tele-banking, teleshopping, satellite telephony, video-ondemand.</li>
    <li>Liquid Crystal Display: Thanks to the new
developments in Liquid Crystal Display
(LCD) technology, the curved television
screen - known as cathode ray tube - may
give to a flat screen that can be hung on a
wall like a painting. Presently, LCDs are
used in a wide range of applications,
including computer monitors, televisions,
instrument panels, aircraft cockpit displays,
and signage. They are common in consumer
devices such as video players, gaming
devices, clocks, watches, calculators, and
telephones.</li>
    <li>Multi-media: Multi-media means
integration of two or more media elements.
It is one of the most recent information
technologies that is becoming popular
world-wide due to its multi-dimensional
approach and uses.</li>
    </ul>
