<h3>Robotics Technology</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTRODUCTION</i></strong></div>

The word “robot” originates from the Czech
word for forced labour, or serf. It was introduced
by playwright Karel Capek, whose fictional
robotic inventions were much like Dr.
Frankenstein’s monster — creatures created by
chemical and biological, rather than mechanical,
methods. But the current mechanical robots of
popular culture are not much different from
these fictional biological creations.
Robotics technology is developing at a rapid
pace, opening up new possibilities for
automating tasks and enriching the lives of
humans. From the automobile assembly line to
automatic home, vacuum cleaners, robotics has
become part of our world.
<br>
<br>
Robotics is the branch of engineering science
and technology that deals with the design,
manufacture, operation, and application of
robots. Robotics is related to electronics,
mechanics, and software.
According to the “Robot Institute of
America,” 1979, “A robot is defined as a
reprogrammable, multifunctional manipulator
designed to move material, parts, tools, or
specialized devices through various programmed motions for the performance of a variety
of tasks.” A robot is described as a machine
designed to execute one or more tasks repeatedly,
with speed and precision. There are as many
different types of robots as there are tasks for
them to perform.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PAST & FUTURE OF ROBOTS</i></strong></div>

First-generation robots date from the 1970’s
and consists of stationary, nonprogrammable,
electromechanical devices without sensors.
Second-generation robots were developed in the
1980’s and could contain sensors and
programmable controllers. Third-generation
robots were developed between approximately
1990 up to the present. These machines can be
stationary or mobile, autonomous or insect type,
with sophisticated programming, speech
recognition and/or synthesis, and other
advanced features.
<br>
<br>
Fourth-generation robots are in the researchand-development phase, and include features
such as artificial intelligence, self-replication, self
assembly, and nanoscale size (physical
dimensions on the order of nanometers, or units
of 10 -9 meter).
A few advanced robots are called androids
because of their superficial resemblance to
human beings. Androids are mobile, usually
moving around on wheels or a track drive
because most robots legs are unstable and
difficult to engineer. The android is not
necessarily the end point of robot evolution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Asimov</i></strong></div>

Asimov is generally credited with the
popularization of the term “Robotics” which
was first mentioned in his story “Runaround”
in 1942. But probably Isaac Asimov’s most
important contribution to the history of the robot
is the creation of his ‘Three Laws of Robotics’:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>A robot may not injure a human being,
or, through inaction, allow a human being
to come to harm.</li>
        <li>A robot must obey the orders given to it
by human beings except where such
orders would conflict with the First Law.</li>
        <li>A robot must protect its own existence as
long as such protection does not conflict
with the First or Second Law.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Asimov later adds a “Zeroth law” to the list:
Zeroth law: A robot may not injure
humanity, or, through inaction, allow humanity
to come to harm, unless this would violate a
higher order law.
<br>
<br>
In 1959, John Minsky started the Artificial
Intelligence Laboratory at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT).This was funded
by Rockefeller Foundation. This gave impetus to
the field of robotics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PARTS OF ROBOT</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Arm</i></strong></div>

The ‘Robotic Arm’ of an industrial robot with
six joints closely resembles a human arm — it
has the equivalent of a shoulder, an elbow and
a wrist. Typically, the shoulder is mounted to a
stationary base structure rather than to a
movable body. This type of robot has six degrees
of freedom, meaning it can pivot in six different
ways. A human arm, by comparison, has seven
degrees of freedom. Your arm’s job is to move
your hand from place to place. Similarly, the
robotic arm’s job is to move an end effector from
place to place. You can outfit robotic arms with
all sorts of end effectors, which are suited to a
particular application.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Controller</i></strong></div>

Digital computer is major controller of a
robot. The robot’s computer controls everything
attached to the circuit. To move the robot, the
computer switches on all the necessary motors
and valves. Most robots are reprogrammable —
to change the robot’s behaviour, you simply write
a new program to its computer. The actuators
are all wired to an electrical circuit. The circuit
powers electrical motors and solenoids directly,
and it activates the hydraulic system by
manipulating electrical valves. The valves
determine the pressurized fluid’s path through
the machine. To move a hydraulic leg, for
example, the robot’s controller would open the
valve leading from the fluid pump to a piston
cylinder attached to that leg. The pressurized
fluid would extend the piston, swiveling the leg
forward. Typically, in order to move their
segments in two directions, robots use pistons
that can push both ways.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sensors</i></strong></div>

Sensors are the instruments that measure
position, force, temperature, etc. Not all robots
have sensory systems, and few have the ability
to see, hear, smell or taste. The most common
robotic sense is the sense of movement — the
robot’s ability to monitor its own motion. A
standard design uses slotted wheels attached to
the robot’s joints. An LED on one side of the
wheel shines a beam of light through the slots to
a light sensor on the other side of the wheel.
When the robot moves a particular joint, the
slotted wheel turns. The slots break the light
beam as the wheel spins. The light sensor reads
the pattern of the flashing light and transmits
the data to the computer.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>End EffectorsEnd Effectors</i></strong></div>

End Effector is like human palm and fingers.
We can outfit robotic arms with all sorts of end
effectors, which are suited to a particular
application. One common end effector is a
simplified version of the hand, which can grasp
and carry different objects. Robotic hands often
have built-in pressure sensors that tell the
computer how hard the robot is gripping a
particular object. This keeps the robot from
dropping or breaking whatever it’s carrying.
Other end effectors include blowtorches, drills
and spray painters.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TYPES OF ROBOTS</i></strong></div>

Broadly there are two types of robots:
Robots on Earth or Industrial Robots:
Typical industrial robots do jobs that are difficult,
dangerous or dull. They lift heavy objects, paint,
handle chemicals, and perform assembly work.
They perform the same job hour after hour, day
after day with precision. They don’t get tired and
they don’t make errors associated with fatigue
and so are ideally suited for performing repetitive
tasks. The major categories of industrial robots
by mechanical structure are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Cartesian Robot/Gantry Robot: Used for
pick and place work, application of
sealant, assembly operations, handling
machine tools and arc welding. It is a
robot whose arm has three prismatic
joints, whose axes are coincident with a
Cartesian coordinator.</li>
        <li>Cylindrical Robot: Used for assembly
operations, handling of machine tools, spot
welding, and handling of die casting
machines. It’s a robot whose axis form a
cylindrical coordinate system.</li>
        <li>Spherical/Polar Robot: Used for handling
of machine tools, spot welding, die
casting, fettling machines, gas welding
and arc welding. It’s a robot whose axis
form a polar coordinate system.</li>
        <li>SCARA Robot: Used for pick and place
work, application of sealant, assembly
operations and handling machine tools.
It’s a robot which has two parallel rotary
joints to provide compliance in a plane.</li>
        <li>Articulated Robot: Used for assembly
operations, die casting, fettling machines,
gas welding, arc welding and spray
painting. It’s a robot whose arm has at
least three rotary joints.</li>
        <li>Parallel Robot: One use is a mobile
platform handling cockpit flight
simulators. It’s a robot whose arms have
concurrent prismatic or rotary joints.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>APPLICATIONS OF ROBOTS</i></strong></div>

Robots are used for the following reasons:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Repetitive tasks that robots can do 24/7.</li>
            <li>Robots never get sick or need time off.</li>
            <li>Robots can do tasks considered too
dangerous for humans.</li>
            <li>Robots can operate equipment to much
higher precision than humans.</li>
            <li>May be cheaper over the long run.</li>
            <li>May be able to perform tasks that are
impossible for humans.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
 
<b>Industrial Robots are used in</b>
<ol>
    <ul>
    <li>General materials handling</li>
            <li>Welding industries</li>
            <li>Inspection</li>
            <li>Improving productivity by increasing per
capita production</li>
            <li>Laboratory applications</li>
            
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Exploration</b>
Robots are used in space missions. In 2002
NASA launched the MER-A “Spirit” rover
destined for Mars.
Robots in the Antarctic Exploration
Researchers from the Thayer School of
Engineering at Dartmouth College have built a
robot designed to do research in Antarctica. This
robot is a general purpose mobile platform that
can carry various instruments and travel in polar
temperatures.
<br>
<br>
<b>Exploring Volcanoes:</b> Volcanologists have
identified that a volcano exploration robot
should be able to carry out a number of key
operations, the most important being the ability
to:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>approach an active volcanic vent</li>
        <li>collect samples of volcanic eruption
products</li>
        <li>collect other physical and chemical data</li>
        <li>survey close to vent openings</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Medical Field</b>
Robots are critical to the medical field where
extreme precision and delicacy is necessary, and
the margin for error is slim.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In the Field of Surgery: Because robots
are able to perform major operations while
only making small incisions, patients get
many benefits: lessened trauma, fewer
infections, decreased healing time, and a
faster discharge from the hospital. Robots
are used to perform heart surgery without
opening patient’s chests.</li>
        <li>In Medical Education: Robots are
currently used to test medical students.
Pregnant humanoid robots, for instance,
prepare students for various birth
complications.</li>
        <li>In Hospital Administration: Robots are
also affecting the way hospitals are run
and medications distributed. They make
sure hospital visits are shorter and the risk
of infection minimized.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Robots in Space</b>
Space-based robotic technology at NASA falls
within three specific mission areas: exploration
robotics, science payload maintenance, and onorbit servicing. Related elements are terrestrial/
commercial applications which transfer
technologies generated from space telerobotics
to the commercial sector and component
technology which encompasses the development
of joint designs, muscle wire, exoskeletons and
sensor technology.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEW DEVELOPMENT IN ROBOTICS</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Modular Robots</i></strong></div>

Modular robots are a new breed of robots
that are designed to increase the utilization of
the robots by modularizing the robots. Modular
robots are capable of adapting their morphology
to tasks and environment, which makes them
more versatile, flexible and robust compared to
fixed-bodied ones. Most current systems lack
mechanical flexibility when increasing the
number of modules due to hard building blocks
(modules) and highly rigid connection
mechanisms. Although this design guarantees
controllability and stability, it minimizes
flexibility. In order to improve adaptation to
environmental changes, softness on the module
level might be beneficial.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nanorobots</i></strong></div>

Nanorobotics is the emerging technology
field of creating machines or robots whose
components are at or close to the microscopic
scale of a nanometer (10 -9 meters). Also known
as "nanobots" or "nanites", they would be
constructed from molecular machines.
Nanobots have been popular staples in
science fiction for some time, and have
experienced periods of relative popularity
among futurist communities. Although they
have been created in a biological context, no
actual mechanical nanobots have yet been
created, but they remain an area of active
research and hold a great deal of promise for a
number of fields. So far, researchers have mostly
produced only parts of these complex systems,
such as bearings, sensors, and synthetic
molecular motors. Possible applications include
micro surgery (on the level of individual cells),
utility fog, manufacturing, weaponry and
cleaning.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</i></strong></div>

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the area of
computer science focusing on creating machines
that can engage on behaviours that humans
consider intelligent. The ability to create
intelligent machines has intrigued humans since
ancient times and today with the advent of the
computer and 50 years of research into AI
programming techniques, the dream of smart
machines is becoming a reality. Researchers are
creating systems which can mimic human
thought, understand speech, beat the best
human chess player, and countless other feats
never before possible. Find out how the military
is applying AI logic to its hi-tech systems, and
how in the near future Artificial Intelligence may
impact our lives.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Approaches to AI</i></strong></div>

Initially, researchers thought that creating an
AI would be simply writing programs for each
and every function an intelligent person
performs. As they went on with this task, they
realized that this approach was too shallow.
Even simple functions like face recognition,
spatial sense, pattern recognition and language
comprehension were beyond their programming
skills.
<br>
<br>
They understood that to create an AI, they
must delve deeper into natural intelligence first.
They tried to understand how cognition,
comprehension, decision-making happen in the
human mind. They had to understand what
understanding really means. Some went into the
study of the brain and tried to understand how
the network of neurons creates the mind. Thus,
researchers branched into different approaches,
but they had the same goal of creating intelligent
machines.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Neural Networks</i></strong></div>

This is the bottom up approach. It basically
aims at mimicking the structure and functioning
of the human brain, to create intelligent
behaviour. Researchers are attempting to build
a silicon-based electronic network that is
modelled on the working and form of the human
brain. Our brain is a network of billions of
neurons, each connected with the other.
At an individual level, a neuron has very little
intelligence, in the sense that it operates by a
simple set of rules, conducting electric signals
through its network. However, the combined
network of all these neurons creates intelligent
behaviour that is unrivaled and unsurpassed. So
these researchers created network of electronic
analogues of a neuron, based on Boolean logic.
Memory was recognized to be an electronic
signal pattern in a closed neural network.
How the human brain works is, it learns to
realize patterns and remembers them. Similarly,
the neural networks developed have the ability
to learn patterns and remember. This approach
has its limitations due to the scale and complexity
of developing an exact replica of a human brain,
as the neurons number in billions. Currently,
through simulation techniques, people create
virtual neural networks. This approach has not
been able to achieve the ultimate goal but there
is a very positive progress in the field. The
progress in the development of parallel
computing will aid it in the future.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Expert Systems</i></strong></div>

This is the top down approach. Instead of
starting at the base level of neurons, by taking
advantage of the phenomenal computational
power of the modern computers, followers of the
expert systems approach are designing
intelligent machines that solve problems by
deductive logic. It is like the dialectic approach
in philosophy.
<br>
<br>
This is an intensive approach as opposed to
the extensive approach in neural networks. As
the name expert systems suggest, these are
machines devoted to solving problems in very
specific niche areas. They have total expertise in
a specific domain of human thought. Their tools
are like those of a detective or sleuth. They are
programmed to use statistical analysis and data
mining to solve problems. They arrive at a
decision through a logical flow developed by
answering yes-no questions.
Chess computers like Fritz and its successors
that beat chess grandmaster Kasparov are
examples of expert systems. Chess is known as
the drosophila or experimental specimen of
artificial intelligence.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Applications of AI</i></strong></div>

Artificial Intelligence in the form of expert
systems and neural networks has applications
in every field of human endeavour. They
combine precision and computational power
with pure logic, to solve problems and reduce
error in operation. Already, robot expert systems
are taking over many jobs in industries that are
dangerous for or beyond human ability. Some
of the applications divided by domains are as
follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Heavy Industries and Space</i></strong></div>    
        
Robotics and Cybernetics have taken a leap
combined with artificial intelligent expert
systems. An entire manufacturing process is now
totally automated, controlled and maintained by
a computer system in car manufacture, machine
tool production, computer chip production and
almost every high-tech process. They carry out
dangerous tasks like handling hazardous
radioactive materials. Robotic pilots carry out
complex manoeuvering techniques of unmanned
spacecrafts sent in space. Japan is the leading
country in the world in terms of robotics research
and use.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Finance</i></strong></div>    
        
Banks use intelligent software applications
to screen and analyze financial data. Softwares
that can predict trends in the stock market have
been created which have been known to beat
humans in predictive power.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Computer Science</i></strong></div>    
        
Researchers in quest of artificial intelligence
have created spin offs like dynamic
programming, object oriented programming,
symbolic programming, intelligent storage
management systems and many more such
tools. The primary goal of creating an artificial
intelligence still remains a distant dream but
people are getting an idea of the ultimate path
which could lead to it.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Aviation</i></strong></div>    
        
Airlines use expert systems in planes to
monitor atmospheric conditions and system
status. The plane can be put on auto pilot once a
course is set for the destination.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Weather Forecast</i></strong></div>  
        
Neural networks are used for predicting
weather conditions. Previous data is fed to a
neural network which learns the pattern and
uses that knowledge to predict weather patterns.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Swarm Intelligence</i></strong></div>    
        
This is an approach to, as well as application
of artificial intelligence similar to a neural
network. Here, programmers study how
intelligence emerges in natural systems like
swarms of bees even though on an individual
level, a bee just follows simple rules. They study
relationships in nature like the prey-predator
relationships that give an insight into how
intelligence emerges in a swarm or collection
from simple rules at an individual level. They
develop intelligent systems by creating agent
programs that mimic the behavior of these
natural systems.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Robots and Artificial Intelligence</i></strong></div>

Like the term “robot” itself, artificial
intelligence is hard to define. Ultimate AI would
be a recreation of the human thought process —
a man-made machine with our intellectual
abilities. This would include the ability to learn
just about anything, the ability to reason, the
ability to use language and the ability to
formulate original ideas. Roboticists are nowhere
near achieving this level of artificial intelligence,
but they have had made a lot of progress with
more limited AI. Today’s AI machines can
replicate some specific elements of intellectual
ability.
<br>
<br>
Computers can already solve problems in
limited realms. The basic idea of AI 
problemsolving is very simple, though its execution is
complicated. First, the AI robot or computer
gathers facts about a situation through sensors
or human input. The computer compares this
information to stored data and decides what the
information signifies. The computer runs
through various possible actions and predicts
which action will be most successful based on
the collected information. Of course, the
computer can only solve problems, it’s
programmed to solve — it doesn’t have any
generalized analytical ability. Chess computers
are one example of this sort of machine.
Some modern robots also have the ability to
learn in a limited capacity. Learning robots
recognize if a certain action (moving its legs in a
certain way, for instance) achieved a desired
result (navigating an obstacle). The robot stores
this information and attempts the successful
action the next time it encounters the same
situation. Again, modern computers can only do
this in very limited situations. They can’t absorb
any sort of information like a human can. Some
robots can learn by mimicking human actions.
In Japan, Roboticists have taught a robot to
dance by demonstrating the moves themselves.
Some robots can interact socially. Kismet, a
robot at M.I.T’s Artificial Intelligence Lab,
recognizes human body language and voice
inflection and responds appropriately. Kismet’s
creators are interested in how humans and
babies interact, based only on tone of speech and
visual cue. This low-level interaction could be
the foundation of a human-like learning system.
Kismet and other humanoid robots at the
M.I.T. AI Lab operate using an unconventional
control structure. Instead of directing every
action using a central computer, the robots
control lower-level actions with lower-level
computers. The program’s director, Rodney
Brooks, believes this is a more accurate model of
human intelligence. We do most things
automatically; we don’t decide to do them at the
highest level of consciousness.
<br>
<br>
The real challenge of AI is to understand how
natural intelligence works. Developing AI isn’t
like building an artificial heart — scientists don’t
have a simple, concrete model to work from. We
do know that the brain contains billions and
billions of neurons, and that we think and learn
by establishing electrical connections between
different neurons. But we don’t know exactly
how all of these connections add up to higher
reasoning, or even low-level operations. The
complex circuitry seems incomprehensible.INTRODUCTION
