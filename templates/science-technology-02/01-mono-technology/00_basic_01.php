<h3>Mono Technology</h3>

Where the 20th Century was the era of
macro-science, characterized by gigantic
Boeings, roaring Shuttles, draconian Dams,
monstrous Refineries & Power plants, the 21st
Century will be dominated by nano-science,
featured with microscopic precision. Nanotechnology is the design, characterization,
production and application of structures, devices
and systems by controlling shape and size at the
nanoscale. Eight to ten atoms span one
nanometer (nm). The human hair is approximately 70,000 to 80,000 nm thick. Nano-science
is the world of atoms, molecules, macromolecules, quantum dots, and macromolecular
assemblies.
<br>
<br>
With the help of nanotechnology, a large set
of materials with distinct properties (optical,
electrical, or magnetic) can be fabricated. Nanoparticles take advantage of their dramatically
increased surface area to volume ratio. Their
optical properties, e.g. fluorescence, become a
function of the particle diameter. When brought
into a bulk material, nano-particles can strongly
influence the mechanical properties, such as the
stiffness or elasticity. For example, traditional
polymers can be reinforced by nano-particles
resulting in novel materials e.g. as lightweight
replacements for metals. In the coming days one
can clearly visualise the huge applications of
nano-science in different fields as follows:

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>NANO SCIENCE IN INDIA</i></strong></div>
    
Nano-tube Filter: The scientists from
Banaras Hindu University have devised a simple
method to produce carbon nanotube filters that
efficiently remove micro to nano-scale
contaminants from water and heavy
hydrocarbons from petroleum. Made entirely of
carbon nanotubes, the filters are easily
manufactured. The nanotube composition
makes the filters strong, reusable, and heat
resistant, and they can be cleaned easily for
reuse.
<br>
Typhoid Detection Kit: Using the nanosensor, developed by Prof. A.K. Sood of IISc,
Bangalore, a Typhoid Detection Kit has been
developed by DRDE, Gwalior. Typhoid fever
caused by Salmonella typhi is a major health
problem and an important challenge to health
authorities of third world countries due to
unsatisfactory water supply, poor sanitary
conditions, malnutrition, emergence of antibiotic
resistant strains, etc.
<br>
Gas Flow Induced Generation of Voltage
from Solids: Prof AK Sood, Professor of Physics
at IISc and his student Shankar Ghosh have
found that the liquid flow in carbon nano-tubes
can generate electric current. One of the most
exciting applications to emerge from the
discovery is the possibility of a heart pacemaker
- like device with nano-tubes, which will sit in
the human body and generate power from blood.
Instead of batteries, the device will generate
power by itself to regulate defective heart
rhythm.
<br>
Drug Delivery System: A research group
headed by Professor A. N. Maitra of the
University of Delhi has developed 11 patentable
technologies for improved drug delivery systems
using nanoparticles. Four of these processes have
been granted U.S. patents. One of the important
achievements at the initial stage of drug delivery
research was development of a reverse micelles
based process for the synthesis of hydrogel and
‘smart’ hydrogel nanoparticles for encapsulating
water-soluble drugs. This method enabled one
to synthesize hydrogel nanoparticles of size less
than 100 nm diameter.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PROGRAMMES FOR DEVELOPMENT
OF NANO TECHNOLOGIES IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

Support to Nanotechnology Business
Incubator (NBI) at NCL, Pune continued during
the year 2012-13. This NBI has nurtured activities
by 7 start-up companies on items likecomputational modelling of flow and chemical
processes, therapeutic potential of
biotechnologically engineered antibodies, ocular
and maxillofacial implants, and 12 start-up
companies are under incubation presently as
Resident Incubates on items like maxillo-facial
surgery, organic chemical synthesis etc. Support
to other ongoing projects in this category
continued during the year. Significant progress
has been made in these projects.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Centre for Nano Science and Engineering
(CeNSE)</i></strong></div>

The Centre for Nano Science and
Engineering (CeNSE) was established in 2010 to
pursue interdisciplinary research across several
disciplines with a focus on nanoscale systems.
Current research topics include, but are not
limited to nanoelectronics, MEMS/NEMS,
nanomaterials and devices, photonics, nanobiotechnology, solar cells and computational
nano-engineering. Apart from the regular faculty
members at CeNSE, almost 40 faculty members
from different departments at IISc are associated
in the academic and research activities at the
centre. The centre offers PhD programmes in a
wide range of areas, and has close interactions
with the industry.
<br>
<br>
A state-of-the art nanofabrication facility
with a clean room spanning 1400 square meters
is located at the centre. In addition, there are
several characterization labs that cater to
material, electronic, mechanical, chemical and
optical characterization.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Basic Research Promotion</i></strong></div>

25 new individual scientist-centric R&D

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NANO MISSION OF INDIA</i></strong></div>

The Government of India, in May 2007,
approved the launch of a Mission on Nano
Science and Technology (Nano Mission) with an
allocation of Rs. 1000 crore for 5 years. The
Department of Science and Technology is the
nodal agency for implementing the Nano
Mission. Capacity-building in this upcoming area
of research will be of utmost importance for the
Nano Mission so that India emerges as a global
knowledge-hub in this field. For this, research
on fundamental aspects of Nano Science and
training of large number of manpower will
receive prime attention. In addition, the Nano
Mission will strive for development of products
and processes for national development,
especially in areas of national relevance like safe
drinking water, materials development, sensors
development, drug delivery, etc. For this, it will
forge linkages between educational and research
institutions and industry and promote Public
Private Partnerships.
<br>
<br>
The Nano Mission has been structured in a
such fashion so as to achieve synergy between
the national research efforts of various agencies
in Nano Science and Technology and launch
new programmes in a concerted fashion.
International collaborative research efforts will
also be made wherever required.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Objectives</i></strong></div>

The Nano Mission is an umbrella programme
for capacity building which envisages the overall
development of this field of research in the
country and to tap some of its applied potential
for nation’s development. The main objectives
of the Nano Mission are -basic research
promotion, infrastructure development for
carrying out front-ranking research,
development of nano technologies and their
applications, human resource development and
international collaborations. During the year
2012-13, Nano Mission continued to record
expansion in its activities and break new
grounds in promotion of R&D and human
resource development in the field of
nanotechnology. In brief, the objectives of the
Nano-Mission are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Research Promotion: Funding of
basic research by individual scientists
and/or groups of scientists and creation
of centres of excellence for pursuing
studies leading to fundamental
understanding of matter that enables
control and manipulation at the
nanoscale.</li>
        <li>Infrastructure Development for Nano
Science & Technology Research:
Investigations on the nano scale require
expensive equipments like Optical
Tweezer, Nano Indentor, Transmission
Electron Microscope (TEM), Atomic Force
Microscope (AFM), Scanning Tunneling
Microscope (STM), Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption Time of Flight Mass
Spectrometer (MALDI TOF MS),
Microarray Spotter & Scanner etc. For
optimal use of expensive and sophisticated
facilities, it is proposed to establish a chain
of shared facilities across the country.</li>
        <li>Nano Applications and Technology
Development Programmes: To catalyze
Applications and Technology Development Programmes leading to products
and devices, the Mission proposes to
promote application-oriented R&D
Projects, establish Nano Applications and
Technology Development Centres, NanoTechnology Business Incubators, etc.
Special effort will be made to involve the
industrial sector into nanotechnology
R&D directly or through Public Private
Partnership (PPP) ventures.</li>
        <li>International Collaborations: Apart from
exploratory visits of scientists, organization
of joint workshops and conferences and
joint research projects, it is also planned
to facilitate access to sophisticated research
facilities abroad, establish joint centres of
excellence and forge academia-industry
partnerships at the international level
wherever required and desirable.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Organizational Structure</i></strong></div>

The Nano Mission is a Mission-Mode
programme within DST. At the apex level, it is
steered by a Nano Mission Council (NMC). It is
currently being chaired by Professor CNR Rao.
The technical programmes of the Nano Mission
are also being guided by two advisory groups,
viz. the Nano Science Advisory Group (NSAG)
and the Nano Applications and Technology
Advisory Group (NATAG).
<br>
<br>
DST Activities in Nano Science and
Technology: The Nano Mission is the second
phase of DST activities in Nano Science and
Technology. DST, in October 2001, had
launched a modest programme in Nano Science
and Technology, called the Nano Science and
Technology Initiative (NSTI), and the Nano
Mission is the successor of this programme.
Under NSTI, and since May 2007 under the
Nano Mission, DST has supported a number of
activities in Nano Science and Technology. A
brief resume of those programmes is being given
below:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Support for R & D Projects to Individual
Scientists: Around 130 projects have been
supported for individual scientists mainly
working on fundamental scientific aspects
of nanoscale systems. Investigations are
aimed at looking into new and improved
understanding of the relationship between
structure of various nanoscale systems and
their properties using sophisticated
characterization facilities.
Significant results have been reported from
these projects. Extensive studies on
semiconductor nanocrystals have been
undertaken in several projects. As semiconductor
particles exhibit size-dependent properties like
scaling of the energy gap and corresponding
change in the optical properties, they are
considered as technologically important
materials. Several projects have looked into
synthesis of important nanomaterials like CdSe,
ZnO etc. Size-tunable, organic-soluble
industrially important CdS, AlN, GaN and InN
nanocrystals have been prepared by employing
novel solvothermal techniques and some soft
chemical routes. In another project, it has been
reported that flow of various liquids and gases
over a mat of single-walled carbon nanotube
(SWNT) bundles generate electrical signals. This
discovery has several important technological
implications. It may have several applications
in the fields of biotechnology, pharmaceutical
industry, drug delivery, intelligent pneumatic
systems, information technology etc.</li>
        <li>Strengthening of Characterization
Facilities: Research with nanoscale
systems requires sophisticated
characterization facilities which were not
available in our institutions. Realizing this
gap, DST has established an array of
sophisticated equipments such as Optical
Tweezer, Nano Indentor, Transmission
Electron Microscope (TEM), Atomic Force
Microscope (AFM), Scanning Tunneling
Microscope (STM), Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption Time of Flight Mass
Spectrometer (MALDI TOF MS),
Microarray Spotter & Scanner etc. at
various locations in the country.</li>
        <li>Establishment of Centres of Excellence:
Eleven Units/Core Groups on Nano
Science have been sanctioned across the
country. These centres of excellence house
some of the more sophisticated facilities
for sharing with other scientists in the
region and would help in promoting
scientific research on nanoscale systems
in a decentralized fashion.
Seven Centres for Nano Technology focusing
on development of specific applications have
also been established. In addition, a centre of
excellence on Computational Materials Science
has also been established at JNCASR, Bangalore.</li>
        <li>International Collaborative Programmes:
As expected, Nano Science and
Technology has prominently figured in all
S&T cooperation agreements entered into
in recent times. Joint R&D activities are
already taking place with several
countries. For example, with the US,
several projects have been funded on
CNTs in composites, nano-encapsulating
materials, etc. under the DST-NSF
programme. Several Indo-US Workshops
have also been held. With Germany, a
programme on engineered functional
nano-composites has started which would
focus on magnetic properties, magnetic
interactions, gas-solid interactions
including catalysis, etc. Programmes are
also on with Italy, EU and developing
with Taiwan. ARCI, Hyderabad, which
is an autonomous institute of DST has
active programme in nano-material with
institutions in Russia, Ukraine, Japan,
Germany and USA.</li>
        <li>Joint Institution-Industry Linked
Projects and Public Private Partnership
activities: In order to focus the existing
expertise in research and educational
institutions towards developing products
and processes of direct interest to
industries, DST, under the Nano
Programme, has promoted Joint
Institution-Industry Linked Projects and
some other Public Private Partnership
activities in recent times. In many of these
activities, the industrial partners have also
invested financially in the project. These
activities will help us to simultaneously
leverage the scientific knowledge-base
existing in our research and educational
institutions and the commercial vision of
our industry to generate competitive
technologies leading to products and
devices. Six such projects have received
financial support so far.</li>
        <li>Human Resource Development in Nano
Science & Technology: In order to train
and nurture human resource in the area
of Nano Science and Technology, a
number of activities have already been
undertaken; for example, organization of
national and international conferences,
national review meetings and advanced
schools, support for post-doctoral fellowships through JNCASR, Bangalore, etc.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THE FUTURE SCOPE OF
NANOTECHNOLOGY</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Creating better Computing Devices:</b>
Perhaps more than anywhere else, the
promise of nanotechnology is causing
excitement in the computer chip and
memory business for very good reasons:
it would enable computer designers to
break through the Moore’s law. Intel cofounder Dr Gordon Moore predicted that
technology that went into integrated
circuits would roughly double in power
every 12-18 months. That is why the latest
Pentium 4 chip clocking 2.4 gigahertz, is
about 25,000 times faster and packs
25,000 as many transistors on board as
the first ever microchip, the Intel 4004 of
1971. Physicists say: it will take at least
10 years at the most before we are able to
dream up a bigger, better, microchip on
that slab of silicon. And that is where
nano-technology comes in: the ability to
fashion electronic circuits-entire
computers-with atom-length nanowires or
nanotubes, made from carbon rather than
silicon, may allow computer hardware to
progress beyond physical barriers of
Moore’s Law.</li>
        <li><b>Nano Biology:</b> The demand for
environmentally sustainable industrial,
agricultural, aquacultural, and silvicultural technologies is bringing about a
shift from chemical-based solutions to
biological based ones.</li>
        <li><b>Nano Medicine:</b> Nanotechnology would
build fleets of computer- controlled
molecular tools (called nanobots or cell
machines) much smaller than a human
cell and built with the accuracy and
precision of drug molecules. If you get a
cold or have contracted AIDS, you’d just
drink a teaspoon of liquid that contained
an army of molecule-sized nanobots
programmed to enter your body’s cells
and fight viruses.</li>
        <li><b>Nanotechnology and Ecology:</b>
Nanotechnology has the potential of
making our environment cleaner. For
instance, if you make plastic with
nanotechnology, you can feed stocks of
pure elements like carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen and force individual atoms
deliberately into chemical bonds without
intermediate steps that produce all those
environmentally unfriendly waste
products.</li>
        <li><b>Nanotechnology in Agriculture:</b> With
nanotechnology, growing food crops to
feed the hungry and starving would no
longer be a problem. Higher crop yields
could be achieved by intensive greenhouse
agriculture. Plants grown in controlled
environments (with optimal temperature,
CO2, water, nutrients, etc) can grow year
round and produce an order of magnitude
more food per acre than the existing
methods.</li>
        <li>Nanotechnology and Use of Natural
Resources: Rather than felling forests to
make paper, we’d have assemblers
synthesizing paper. Rather than using oil
for energy, we’d have molecule-sized solar
cells mixed into road pavement. With such
solar nanocells, a sunny patch of
pavement of a few hundred square miles
could generate enough energy for a
country of the size of India.</li>
        <li><b>Nano Economy:</b> Nanotechnology will
fundamentally revolutionize most
industries. Assemblers will be able to build
copies of themselves quickly, using
inexpensive materials, little energy, and
no human labour, a single assembler can
be used to make billions.</li>
        <li><b>Nanoweapons:</b> The weapons of the
nanogeneration will not only be much
smaller than today’s, but much deadlier.
Distributed surveillance systems could
quickly identify arms buildups and
offensive weapons deployments, while
lighter, stronger, and smarter materials
controlled by powerful molecular
computers would let us make radically
improved versions of existing weapons.</li>
        <li><b>Nanotechnology in Space Science:</b> Space
transportation costs could be reduced
considerably with nanotechnology.
Comparing structural components made
from titanium versus a diamondoid
composite material, it is estimated that
single stage to orbit transportation costs
would drop (in one scenario) from $16,000
/ kg to $3.54 / kg.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEW DEVELOPMENTS</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bio-Nanotechnology</i></strong></div>

The biological and medical research scientists
have exploited the unique properties of nanomaterials for various applications e.g., contrast
agents for cell imaging and therapeutics for
treating cancer. Biological tests measuring the
presence or activity of selected substances become
quicker, more sensitive and more flexible when
certain nanoscale particles are put to work as
tags or labels. Magnetic nano-particles, bound
to a suitable antibody, are used to label specific
molecules, structures or microorganisms. For
example, gold nano-particles tagged with short
segments of DNA can be used for detection of
genetic sequence in a sample.
The overall drug consumption and sideeffects can be lowered significantly by depositing
the active agent in the morbid region only and
in no higher dose than needed. This highly
selective approach reduces costs and human
sufferings. They could hold small drug molecules
transporting them to the desired location. Some
potentially important applications include
cancer treatment with iron nano-particles or gold
shells.
<br>
<br>
Nanotechnology can help to reproduce or to
repair damaged tissue. This so called “tissue
engineering” makes use of artificially stimulated
cell proliferation by using suitable nanomaterialbased scaffolds and growth factors. Tissue
engineering might replace today’s conventional
treatments, e.g. transplantation of organs or
artificial implants.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chemistry & Environment</i></strong></div>

Chemical catalysis and filtration techniques
are two prominent examples where
nanotechnology already plays a role. The
synthesis provides novel materials with tailored
features and chemical properties e.g. nanoparticles with a distinct chemical surrounding
or specific optical properties. Chemical catalysis
benefits especially from nano-particles, due to
Chronicle IAS Academy [11]
the extremely large surface of volume ratio. The
application potential of nano-particles in
catalysis ranges from fuel cell to catalytic
converters and photocatalytic devices. Catalysis
is also important for the production of chemicals.
A strong influence of nano-chemistry on wastewater treatment, air purification and energy
storage devices is to be expected. Mechanical or
chemical methods can be used for effective
filtration techniques. Nano-porous membranes
are suitable for a mechanical filtration with
extremely small pores smaller than 10 nm.
Nanofiltration is mainly used for the removal of
ions or the separation of different fluids.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Energy</i></strong></div>

The most advanced nanotechnology projects
related to energy are: storage, conversion,
manufacturing improvements by reducing
materials and process rates, energy saving e.g.
by better thermal insulation, and enhanced
renewable energy sources. Nanotechnology can
help to increase the efficiency of Solar light
conversion by specifically designed
nanostructures. The degree of efficiency of
combustion engines is not higher than 15-20 per
cent at the moment. Nanotechnology can
improve combustion by designing specific
catalysts with maximized surface area.
The most prominent nanostructured material
in fuel cells is the catalyst consisting of carbon
supported noble metal particles with diameters
of 1- 5 nm. Suitable materials for hydrogen
storage contain a large number of small
nanosized pores. Many nanostructured
materials like nanotubes, zeolites or alanates are
under investigation. Nanotechnology can
contribute to the further reduction of combustion
engine pollutants by nanoporous filters, which
can clean the exhaust mechanically, by catalytic
converters based on nanoscale noble metal
particles or by catalytic coatings on cylinder
walls and catalytic nano-particles as additives
for fuels.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Information & Communication</i></strong></div>

Current high-technology production
processes are based on traditional top down
strategies, where nanotechnology has already
been introduced silently. The critical length scale
of integrated circuits is already at the nanoscale
(50 nm and below) regarding the gate length of
transistors in CPUs or DRAM devices. In the
modern communication technology, traditional
analog electrical devices are increasingly
replaced by optical or optoelectronic devices due
to their enormous bandwidth and capacity,
respectively. Two promising examples are
photonic crystals and quantum dots.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Consumer Goods</i></strong></div>

Nanotechnology is already impacting the
field of consumer goods, providing products with
novel functions ranging from easy-to-clean to
scratch-resistant. Already in use are different
nano-particle improved products. Nanotechnology can be applied in the production,
processing, safety and packaging of food. A
nanocomposite coating process could improve
food packaging by placing anti-microbial agents
directly on the surface of the coated film.
Nanocomposites could increase or decrease gas
permeability of different fillers as is needed for
different products. They can also improve the
mechanical and heat-resistance properties and
lower the oxygen transmission rate.
The first sunglasses using protective and
antireflective ultrathin polymer coatings are in
the market. For optics, nanotechnology also offers
scratch resistant coatings based on
nanocomposites. The use of nanofibres makes
clothes water and stain-repellent or wrinkle-free.
Textiles with a nanotechnological finish can be
washed less frequently and at lower
temperatures. Nanotechnology has been used to
integrate tiny carbon particles membrane &
guarantee full-surface protection from
electrostatic charges for the wearer.
