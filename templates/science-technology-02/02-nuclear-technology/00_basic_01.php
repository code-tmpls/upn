<h3>Nuclear Technology</h3>

India has a vision of becoming a world leader
in nuclear technology due to its expertise in fast
reactors and thorium fuel cycle. Per capita power
consumption in India is around 400 Kwh/yr,
which is much below the world average
consumption of 2400 Kwh/yr. Thus, massive
increase in the power generation to match the
world average consumption is needed in the
coming years to enhance the overall national
growth rate. The estimated coal deposits in India
is 206 billion tonnes (6% of the world coal
reserves) and the distribution of conventional
energy sources in India is:
<br>
<br>
Coal & Lignite – 68%
<br>
Natural gases - 12%
<br>
Petroleum – 12 %
<br>
<br>
This is far from adequate to meet the
increasing future energy demands. Moreover the
high sulphur and ash content in Indian coal
creates environmental and ecological problems.
Hydel power generation capacity is limited and
depends on erratic monsoon.
India has consciously proceeded to explore
the possibility of tapping nuclear energy for the
purpose of power generation and the Atomic
Energy Act was framed and implemented with
the set objectives of using two naturally
occurring elements Uranium and Thorium
having good potential to be utilized as nuclear
fuel in Indian Nuclear Power Reactors. The
estimated natural deposits of these elements in
India are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Natural Uranium deposits - 70,000 tonnes</li>
        <li>Thorium deposits - 3,60,000 tonnes</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited
(NPCIL) is a Public Sector Enterprise under the
administrative control of the Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE), Government of India. The
Company was registered as a Public Limited
Company under the Companies Act, 1956 in
September 1987 with the objective of operating
the atomic power stations and implementing the
atomic power projects for generation of
electricity in pursuance of the schemes and
programmes of the Government of India under
the Atomic Energy Act, 1962.
<br>
<br>
NPCIL is a MOU signing Company with
DAE. Presently NPCIL is operating twenty
nuclear power plants with total installed
capacity of 4780 MWe. NPCIL has achieved
more than 379 reactor years of safe nuclear
power plant operating experience. NPCIL
operates plants with motto ‘Safety first and
Production next’. The reactor fleet comprises two
Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) and eighteen
Pressurised Heavy Water Reactors (PHWRs)
including one 100 MW PHWR at Rajasthan
which is owned by DAE, Government of India.
Currently it has six reactors under various stages
of construction totaling 4800 MW capacity out
of which one reactor of 1000 MW capacity at
Kudankulam, Tamil Nadu, has attained
criticality on July 13, 2013.
The target since about 2004 has been for
nuclear power to provide 20 GWe by 2020, but
in 2007 the Prime Minister referred to this as
"modest" and capable of being doubled with the
opening up of International cooperation.
However, it is evident that even the 20 GWe
target would require substantial uranium
imports. In June 2009, NPCIL said it aimed for
60 GWe nuclear by 2032, including 40 GWe of
PWR capacity and 7 GWe of new PHWR
capacity, all fuelled by imported uranium. This
2032 target was reiterated late in 2010 and
increased to 63 GWe in 2011. But in December
2011 Parliament was told that more realistic
targets were 14,600 MWe by 2020-21 and 27,500
MWe by 2032, relative to present 4780 MWe and
10,080 MWe when reactors under construction
were on line in 2017.
<br>
<br>
The XII Plan envisages start of work on eight
indigenous 700 MW Pressurised Heavy Water
Reactors (PHWRs), two 500 MW Fast Breeder
Reactors (FBRs), one 300 MW Advanced Heavy
Water Reactor (AHWR) and eight Light Water
Reactors of 1000 MW or higher capacity with
foreign technical cooperation. These nuclear
power reactors are expected to be completed
progressively in the XIII and XIV Plans. The
power generation increased by 23 percent
during the year 2011-12, 32455 Million KWh as
against 26472 Million KWh during the year
2010-11. The net export increased by 24 percent
during the year 2011-12, 29123 Million KWh as
against 23533 Million KWh during the year
2010-11.
The Nuclear Power Corporation of India Ltd
(NPCIL) is responsible for design, construction,
commissioning and operation of thermal nuclear
power plants. Its funding model is 70% equity
and 30% debt financing. However, it is aiming
to involve other public sector and private
corporations in future nuclear power expansion,
notably National Thermal Power Corporation
(NTPC). NTPC is largely government-owned,
and the 1962 Atomic Energy Act prohibits
private control of nuclear power generation.
The two Tarapur 160 MWe Boiling Water
Reactors (BWRs) built by GE on a turnkey
contract before the advent of the Nuclear NonProliferation Treaty were originally 200 MWe.
They were down-rated due to recurrent
problems but have run well since. They have been
using imported enriched uranium and are under
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
safeguards. However, late in 2004 Russia
deferred to the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group and
declined to supply further uranium for them.
They underwent six months refurbishment over
2005-06, and in March 2006 Russia agreed to
resume fuel supply. In December 2008 a $700
million contract with Rosatom was announced
for continued uranium supply to them.
The two small Canadian (Candu) PHWRs
at Rajasthan nuclear power plant started up in
1972 and 1980, and are also under safeguards.
Rajasthan-1 was down-rated early in its life and
has operated very little since 2002 due to ongoing
problems and has been shut down since 2004 as
the government considers its future. Rajasthan2 was restarted in September 2009 after major
refurbishment, and running on imported
uranium at full rated power.
<br>
<br>
The 220 MWe PHWRs (202 MWe net) were
indigenously designed and constructed by
NPCIL, based on a Canadian design. The
Kalpakkam (MAPS) reactors were refurbished
in 2002-03 and 2004-05 and their capacity
restored to 220 MWe gross (from 170). Much of
the core of each reactor was replaced, and the
lifespans extended to 2033/36. Kakrapar unit 1
was repaired and upgraded in 2009, as was
Narora-2.
Following the Fukushima accident in March
2011, four NPCIL taskforces evaluated the
situation in India and in an interim report in July
made recommendations for safety improvements
of the Tarapur BWRs and each PHWR type. The
report of a high-level committee appointed by
the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB)
was submitted at the end of August 2011, saying
that the Tarapur and Madras plants needed
some supplementary provisions to cope with
major disasters. The two Tarapur BWRs have
already been upgraded to ensure continuous
cooling of the reactor during prolonged station
blackouts and to provide nitrogen injection to
containment structures, but further work is
recommended. Madras needs enhanced flood
defences in case of tsunamis higher than that in
2004. The prototype fast breeder reactor (PFR)
under construction next door at Kalpakkam has
defences which are already sufficiently high,
following some flooding of the site in 2004.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NUCLEAR PROGRAMME</i></strong></div>

The Tata Institute of Fundamental Research
(TIFR), which came up in 1945, provided the base
and the structure for organising the early efforts
for India’s nuclear energy programme. Hence,
it is also referred to as the ‘cradle of Indian
nuclear power programme.’
The horrors of the nuclear holocaust
unleashed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki were
followed by a new vista of atoms for peace, of
nuclear power generation, transformations in
agriculture and medical diagnostics and therapy
for using atomic Science & Technology. It’s in
this context that in April 1948, the Atomic
Energy Bill was enacted with the primary
objective to develop, control and use atomic
energy for peaceful purposes, a clear departure
from the policy followed by the nuclear powers,
often forgotten or ignored by the international
community. India under the leadership of
Jawaharlal Nehru was dedicated to the peaceful
uses of atomic energy but it couldn’t wish away
the lurking threat posed by nuclear weapons,
and so per force Indian option for nuclear
weapons was kept open. For both areas peaceful
applications and the weapon option, Dr. Homi
Bhabha, the architect of India’s nuclear
programme, had a clear strategic vision and
priorities.
<br>
<br>
Subsequently, India’s Atomic Energy
Commission was set up on 10 August, 1948
under the Chairmanship of Dr. Bhabha with the
sole objective of formulation and implementation
of the governmental policy relating to the
development of nuclear power in India. In fact,
India was among the first eight countries of the
world to have an Atomic Energy Commission.
The next step was the establishment of the
Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) with
Bhabha as its Secretary in August 1954, the
objectives of which, inter alia included:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Proper use of the latest technologies for
the development of nuclear power.</li>
        <li>To ensure nuclear power generation
against global economic competition by
exploiting natural resources.</li>
        <li>Establishment of nuclear power reactors
and safe use of radioactive substances.</li>
        <li>Production of nuclear power for meeting
the defence requirements of India.</li>
        <li>To understand the role of nuclear power
in economic development.</li>
        <li>To carry out programmes on isotopes and
radiation technology.</li>
        <li>To support basic research in nuclear
energy and other frontier areas of science.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Thus, India directed its nuclear power
programme for attaining self -reliance on a broad
front which comprised mineral exploration and
mining, extraction of uranium and zirconium,
designing and fabricating reactor control
systems, production of heavy water, making
radio isotopes and promoting their use in
agriculture, medicine, etc., safety of nuclear
power reactors and monitoring the radiation level
for ensuring a safe limit.
Key milestones of Nuclear Programme:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Rajasthan Atomic Power Station,
Rawatbhata in Rajasthan, is India’s first
nuclear park.</li>
        <li>Narora Atomic Power Station is Asia’s
first nuclear power plant to obtain ISO14001 accreditation for its environment
management system.</li>
        <li>Kakrapar Atomic Power Station was the
first Indian nuclear power plant to
undergo a peer review by an international
team of experts from the World
Association of Nuclear Operators
(WANO). All other Indian nuclear power
stations are also peer reviewed by WANO.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>N-POWER POLICY OF INDIA</i></strong></div>

In the beginning of the Eighth Plan, it was
aimed to produce 10,000 MW of power by 2000,
to increase the nuclear power share in total
power production. In order to achieve the above
objective, the Central Government established
Nuclear Power Corporation to coordinate
various nuclear power organisations, in 1989.
But, it was unlikely to achieve this objective,
particularly after the disintegration of USSR, and
then the target was reduced to 9000 MW.
However, still it was not possible in the near
future. Indian scientists have planned to achieve
the above target in future through the
development of three generations of nuclear
reactors:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>1st Generation Nuclear Reactors: These
are the pressurized Heavy Water reactors
with the capacity of 235 HW each and
use natural uranium as fuel. Plutonium is
the by-product.</li>
        <li>2nd Generation Nuclear Reactors: These
are planned to be the fast breeder reactors
with the capacity of 500 HW each, and
use Plutonium, a by-product of the first
generation reactors, as the fuel.</li>
        <li>3rd Generation Nuclear Reactors: These
are also planned to be the fast breeder
reactors. This generation reactors will use
fuel derived from second generation
reactors and convert more Thorium into
Uranium-233. So, the plan is to use vast
Thorium deposits found in India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

India has established 1st generation nuclear
reactors at Tarapur, Kalpakkam, Narora and
Rawatbhata. Other two reactors of this grade
are located at Kakrapar (Gujarat) and Kaiga
(Karnataka). The first generation reactors have
reached commercial stage. The generation of
power from nuclear energy began in India in
1969 with the commissioning of first atomic
power station at Tarapore (TAPS).
<br>
<br>
The second generation reactor has
commenced with the successful operation of the
Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR) named
KAMINI (Kalpakkam Mini Reactor) in 1985 at
the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research
(IGCAR) at Kalpakkam in Tamil Nadu.
The Kalpakkam reactor is the world’s first
fast-breeder reactor. The reactor has successfully
used the mixed uranium - plutonium carbide
fuel, hitherto untried elsewhere. Progress has
also been made in the third generation reactor
with the successful development of a U-233
based fuel. Work has commenced on the design
of an Advanced Heavy Water Reactor which
will make the use of thorium in power
generation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chief Features of FBTR</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The nuclear chain reaction in the uranium
fuel in a thermal reactor is sustained by
slowing down the neutrons by a
moderator. The chain reaction in FBTR is
sustained by fast neutrons. The number
of neutrons released per fission is more
compared to that of thermal reactor. The
extra neutrons are available for absorption
in uranium-238 to transform it to fissile
plutonium-239.</li>
        <li>In a thermal reactor typically only about
1-2 per cent of the natural uranium is
utilized whereas in FBTRs, the utilization
is increased 60 to 70 times.</li>
        <li>Considering the nuclear and heat transfer
properties of various possible coolants,
Sodium has been universally accepted as
the coolant for FBTRs. In Thermal reactors
water is used as a coolant.</li>
        <li>The radioactivity released to the
atmosphere and the radiation dose
received by the operating personnel in
FBTRs has been much less compared to
the water control reactors.</li>
        <li>FBTR is based on the design of the
Rhapsodic reactor, France.</li>
        <li>The fuel used to FBTR is mixed carbide of
plutonium and natural uranium. The
carbide fuel has higher breeding ratio due
to its higher density and thermal
conductivity.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Why India Prefers Fast Breeders :</b> A fast
breeder reactor (FBR) breeds more fuel than it
consumes that is it produces more plutonium than
it consumes while generating power. For a
uranium scarce country like India, it is an
attractive technology. Plutonium produced in
the thermal reactors as spent fuel is ideally
suitable as the fuel material for use in the FBR
due to its high fission neutron yield. Since the
number of neutrons produced in plutonium
fission is high, it helps to produce more
plutonium from uranium (U-238) used as a
blanket surrounding the fuel core of the FBR. FBR
also consumes less uranium and that too very
effectively. While the thermal reactors exploit
only 0.6 per cent of uranium, a FBR utilises 70-
75 per cent of it. Thus, it leaves less radioactive
waste to dispose of. In fact, many scientists in
India prefer FBRs for this reason.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT</i></strong></div>

The Atomic Energy Commission, set up in
1948, is responsible for formulating the policy
for all atomic energy activities in the country.
The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) is the
executive agency for implementing the atomic
energy programme. There are three public sector
undertakings under the administrative control
of DAE:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Indian Rare Earth’s Limited (IREL) which
has set up the Orissa Sands Complex
(OSCOM) at Chhattarpur for enhancing
Rare Earth’s production.</li>
        <li>Uranium Corporation of India Limited
(UCIL) with mines at Jaduguda in
Jharkhand</li>
        <li>Electronics Corporation of India Limited
(ECIL) which manufactures electronic
instruments and equipment for nuclear as
well as non-nuclear users.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Nuclear Power Corporation of DAE is
responsible for design, construction and
operation of nuclear power stations. Presently,
Nuclear Power Corporation is operating 20
nuclear power reactors, including 18 PHWRs
and 2 Boiling Water Reactors (BWR), with an
installed capacity of 4,780 MW; six nuclear
power reactors with an aggregate capacity of
4,800 MW are under different stages of
construction. The Nuclear Fuel Complex (NFC)
at Hyderabad fabricates nuclear fuel for the
power reactors. NPCIL indigenously scaling up
the capacity of PHWRs from 220 MW to 700 MW
and attaining and sustaining over 90%
availability factor. NPCIL Power Stations are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tarapur Atomic Power Station (TAPS)</li>
        <li>Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS)</li>
        <li>Madras Atomic Power Station (MAPS)</li>
        <li>Kaiga Generating Station</li>
        <li>Narora Atomic Power Station (NAPS)</li>
        <li>Kakrapar Atomic Power Station (KAPS)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

There are three research reactors in operation
at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre at
Trombay. These are: APSARA (one MW
swimming pool reactor), CIRUS (40 MW thermal
reactor) and DHRUVA (100 MW thermal
reactor). A mini pool 30 KW reactor KAMINI,
containing Uranium -233 fuel is in an advanced
stage of construction at Kalpakkam. Plutoniumfuelled fast reactor PURNIMA-I was built at
Trombay in 1972. Later in 1984, it was modified
as a homogenous reactor PURNIMA-II which
uses Uranium-233 fuel in the form of a solution.
<br>
<br>
PURNIMA-III is the modified form of
PURNIMA-II to test the KAMINI core.
PURNIMA-III is a zero-energy reactor and is the
world’s first experimental research reactor to use
Uranium-233 as fuel.
The Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic
Research (IGCAR) at Kalpakkam carries out
research and development pertaining to latest
reactor technology. The major facility at the
centre is the indigenously constructed 40 MW
and 13 MW Fast Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR).
The FBTR is a major step in the country’s nuclear
power programme. It has paved the way for
using our vast thorium resources. The Centre for
Advanced Technology was set up in 1984 at
Indore to spearhead research in high technology
fields such as fusion, lasers and accelerators. The
country’s first heavy ion accelerator of medium
energy capacity called, ‘Pelletron’ has become
fully operational at the TIFR. Pelletron is based
on a tandem Van De Graff accelerator with 14
million volts terminal voltage.
<br>
<br>
The Atomic Energy Regulatory Board
(AERB), set up in 1985, carries out regulatory
and safety functions as envisaged under the
Atomic Energy Act-1962. It lays down safety
standards, and frames rules and regulations in
regard to regulatory and safety requirements.
The Fast Breeder Test Reactor with a design
capacity of 40 MW thermal and 13 MW electrical
power, attained its first criticality on October 18,
1985 at the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic
Research (IGCAR), Kalpakkam. The fuel used
in FBTR is a mixed carbide of plutonium and
natural uranium, the proportion of the latter
being 30 per cent. Such a composition is being
used for the first time in the world. The
technology for the fabrication of the fuel was
developed at the Radio-metallurgy Division of
BARC. The next step after FBTR is to design and
construct a Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor
(PFBR) of 500 MW capacity. The 500 MW size
of reactor has been selected to match the size of
coal fired thermal power stations and PHWRs.
The PFBR will be cooked by sodium as in the
case of FBTR, but it will use the pool-type concept
which is more favoured in recent times due to
better safety and more operating experience.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RESEARCH CENTRES</i></strong></div>

MWe proto-type has been completed and the
same is undergoing review.
<br>
<br>
Centre for Advanced Technology (CAT),
established in Indore in 1984, focuses its research
on lasers, accelerators, high vacuum technology
and cryogenics. It has set up two synchrotron
Radiation Sources (INDUS - 1 & INDUS -2) and
developed versatile lasers such as 70 W and 400
W carbon dioxide lasers for industrial, medical
and research applications. The Variable Energy
Cyclotron Centre (VECC) at Kolkata is a national
facility for advanced research in nuclear physics,
nuclear chemistry, production of novel medical
isotopes and study of radiation damage in reactor
materials. The Seismic Activity Monitoring
Station at Gauribidanur near Bengaluru helps
in detection and identification of underground
nuclear explosions anywhere in the world.
Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced
Technology (RRCAT) was established in May,
1984 by the Department of Atomic Energy, India
to expand the activities carried out at Bhabha
Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Mumbai, in
two frontline areas of science and technology
namely Lasers and Accelerators. Since then, the
centre has rapidly grown into a premier institute
for research and development in lasers,
accelerators and their applications.
<br>
<br>
<b>Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre (VECC)</b>

Central Region).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIAN RESEARCH REACTORS</i></strong></div>

There are seven Research Reactors working
in the country named as: Apsara, Cirus, Kamini,
Purnima I, Purnima II, Purnima III and Zerlina.
India’s first research reactor, APSARA, a 1 MWe
‘swimming pool’ type, built indigenously,
became operational at Trombay in 1956,
heralding a novel nuclear age in Asia. ZERLINA,
a zero energy tank type research reactor was built
indigenously in 1961. CIRUS, a tank type reactor
of 40 MWe was commissioned at Tarapur in
1960 with the assistance of Canada, for
engineering experimental work with facilities for
materials testing and radioisotope production.
Moreover, with the commissioning of PURNIMA
I & PURNIMA II respectively in 1972 and 1984,
India achieved an important milestone in its ‘fast
reactor’ programme. DHRUVA, an indigenous
tank type 100 MWe reactor went into operation
in 1985 for research in advanced nuclear physics
and for isotope production. PURNIMA III, also
a tank type reactor of 1 MWe attained criticality
on 9 November, 1990. The sole objective of this
reactor is to conduct mock up studies for Kamini
reactor.
<br>
<br>
The construction of KAMINI (Kalpakkam
Mini Reactor) in 1996 marks an important land
mark in India’s endeavour at mastering uranium
-233-based nuclear fuel. Designed on the basis
of Rapsody reactor of France, it is the only
reactor in the world which uses U-233 as fuel. It
will be mainly used to study the highly
radioactive fuel elements which are discharged
from FBTR at Kalpakkam. This will help in the
development of high performance plutonium
fuel elements for the proto-type FBR to be built
in the next century. It is also called the ‘Zero -
Power’ reactor as the amount of electricity
produced (40 MWe) is consumed by the reactor
itself for research purposes. The design for India’s
next generation of reactors, called Advanced
Heavy Water Reactors (AHWRs), which will
employ thorium-based fuel, has already been
prepared.
BARC has developed comprehensive
technology for industrial operations in fuel
reprocessing and waste management.
Reprocessing plants are operational in Trombay
and Tarapur. The first fuel reprocessing plant at
Trombay is based on hot - cell technology. A
comprehensive waste management technology
for handling and safe disposal of all types of
waste, generated in nuclear industries, has been
perfected by the centre. It has also undertaken
the recent studies of high-energy-density systems.
<br>
<br>
BARC has been able to develop a plasma - based
aerosol generator and also achieved plasma
coatings of alumina on carbon steel moulds.
Moreover, BARC has also been working on the
pulsed electron beam system and has developed
Kilo Ampere Linear Injector (KALI - 5000) which
finds applications in high power microwave
generation and pulsed intense neutron source.
BARC has undertaken an extensive
programme on laser cooling and trapping of
atoms. Very recently, it has been able to develop
the atom laser, which uses coherent beam of
massive bosons. The objectives of this programme
are two-fold: first, to study the ultra-high
resolution spectrospectry for fundamental
physics experiments and second, experiments
leading to Bose - Einstein condensation.
Following the global interest in fabricating high
temperature superconducting materials, BARC
has succeeded in synthesising a single phase
superconducting compound of bismuth-leadcalcium-strontium and copper oxide with a
temperature equivalent to 120K.
India’s tokamak, Aditya, was installed in
1989 at the Institute of Plasma Research in
Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad. It is an indigenous
effort, which can generate plasma at 5 million
degree Celsius. The discoveries made by Aditya
in plasma research and edge turbulence have
had an impact on the world fusion research
programme.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BHAVINI</i></strong></div>

The Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) in
its Golden Jubilee Year has set up its fifth public
sector unit -Bharatiya Nabhikiya Vidyut Nigam
Limited (BHAVINI). BHAVINI is a wholly
owned Enterprise of Government of India under
the administrative control of the Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE) incorporated on 22nd
October 2003 as Public Limited Company. It
was incorporated under the Companies Act
1956, with an authorized share capital of Rs.
5000 crore, BHAVINI is responsible for the
construction and commissioning of the country’s
first 500 MWe Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) project
at Kalpakkam, Tamil Nadu and to pursue
construction, commissioning, operation and
maintenance of subsequent Fast Breeder Reactors
for generation of electricity in pursuance of the
schemes and programmes of Government of
India under the provisions of the Atomic Energy
Act,1962. It is a forerunner of commercial fast
breeder power reactors in the country and in this
regard, it marks a major step in the country’s
efforts to ensuring energy security through the
use of atomic energy.
<br>
<br>
BHAVINI is currently constructing a
500MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor (PFBR)
at Kalpakkam. The PFBR is the forerunner of the
future Fast Breeder Reactors and is expected to
provide energy security to the country. The PFBR
is being built with the design and technology
developed at the Indira Gandhi Centre for

Kalpakkam. The four other PSUs under the
Department are Nuclear Power Corporation of
India Ltd. (NPCIL), Electronics Corporation of
India Ltd. (ECIL), Indian Rare Earths Ltd. (IREL)
and Uranium Corporation of India Ltd. (UCIL).
The engineering design and technical
expertise for BHAVINI will be drawn from the
Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research
(IGCAR), which has accumulated over two
decades of experience in fast breeder reactor
technology. NPCIL, which will take 5% of the
equity in the new company, will provide the
expertise for project management to enable
timely construction and commissioning of the
project. NPCIL is at present operating 20 nuclear
power reactors and setting up 3 more at different
locations in the country.
When completed, PFBR would produce
electricity through recycle of plutonium and
depleted uranium recovered from the spent fuel
of Pressurized Heavy Water Reactors being
operated by NPCIL.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>URANIUM FUEL CYCLE</i></strong></div>

DAE’s Nuclear Fuel Complex at Hyderabad
undertakes refining and conversion of uranium,
which is received as magnesium diuranate
(yellow cake) and refined. The main 400 t/yr
plant fabricates PHWR fuel (which is
unenriched). A small (25 t/yr) fabrication plant
makes fuel for the Tarapur BWRs from imported
enriched (2.66% U-235) uranium. Depleted
uranium oxide fuel pellets (from reprocessed
uranium) and thorium oxide pellets are also
made for PHWR fuel bundles. Mixed carbide fuel
for FBTR was first fabricated by Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC) in 1979.
Heavy water is supplied by DAE’s Heavy
Water Board, and the seven plants are working
at capacity due to the current building
programme.
<br>
<br>
A very small enrichment plant - insufficient
even for the Tarapur reactors - is operated by
DAE’s Rare Materials Plant at Ratnahalli near
Mysore. Some centrifuge R&D is undertaken by
BARC.
Fuel fabrication is by the Nuclear Fuel
Complex in Hyderabad, which is setting up a
new 500 t/yr PHWR fuel plant at Rawatbhata
in Rajasthan, to serve the larger new reactors.
Each 700 MWe reactor is said to need 125 t/yr
of fuel. The company is proposing joint ventures
with US, French and Russian companies to
produce fuel for these reactors.
Reprocessing: Used fuel from the civil
PHWRs is reprocessed by Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC) at Trombay, Tarapur
and Kalpakkam to extract reactor-grade
plutonium for use in the fast breeder reactors.
Small plants at each site were supplemented by
a new Kalpakkam plant of some 100 t/yr
commissioned in 1998, and this is being extended
to reprocess FBTR carbide fuel. Apart from this
all reprocessing uses the Purex process. Further
capacity is being built at Tarapur and
Kalpakkam, to come on line by 2010. India will
reprocess the used fuel from the Kudankulam
reactors and will keep the plutonium.
<br>
<br>
In 2003, a facility was commissioned at
Kalpakkam to reprocess mixed carbide fuel using
an advanced Purex process. Future FBRs will also
have these facilities co-located.
The PFBR and the next four FBRs to be
commissioned by 2020 will use oxide fuel. After
that it is expected that metal fuel with higher
breeding capability will be introduced and 
burnup is intended to increase from 100 to 200 GWd/t.
Under plans for the India-specific safeguards
to be administered by the IAEA in relation to
the civil-military separation plan several fuel
fabrication facilities will come under safeguards.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Uranium Resources in India</i></strong></div>

India's uranium resources are modest, with
102,600 tonnes U as reasonably assured
resources (RAR) and 37,200 tonnes as inferred
 resources in situ (to $260/kgU) at January 2011.
In February 2012, 152,000 tU was claimed by
DAE. Accordingly, India expects to import an
increasing proportion of its uranium fuel needs.
In 2013 it was importing about 40% of uranium
requirements.
<br>
<br>
Mining and processing of uranium is carried
out by Uranium Corporation of India Ltd
(UCIL), a subsidiary of the Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE). The Company is having
its mining operations at Bagjata, Jaduguda,
Bhatin, Narwapahar, Turamdih underground
mines and Banduhurang opencast mines and
upcoming mining projects at Mohuldih in East
Singhbhum district of Jharkhand and at
Tummalapalle mining project in Andhra
Pradesh and Gogi mining project at Karnataka.
It has two processing plants at Jaduguda and
Turamdih and an upcoming milling project at
Tummalepalle in Andra Pradesh. KPM opencast
mining and milling project at Meghalaya is in
the pipeline.
Plans were announced to invest almost US$
700 million to open further mines in Jharkhand
at Banduhurang, Bagjata and Mohuldih; in
Meghalaya at Domiasiat-Mawthabah (with a
mill) and in Andhra Pradesh at LambapurPeddagattu (with mill 50km away at Seripally),
both in Nalgonda district.
In Jharkhand, Banduhurang is India’s first
open cut mine and was commissioned in 2007.
Bagjata is underground and was opened in
December 2008, though there had been earlier
small operations 1986-91. A new mill at
Turamdih in Jharkhand, with 3000 t/day
capacity, was commissioned in 2008. The
Mohuldih underground mine of Jharkhand has
been developed as a modern underground mine
and was commissioned by Chairman &
Managing Director, UCIL on 17th April 2012.
UCIL now operates six underground mines and
one openpit mine in the state of Jharkhand in
addition to an underground mine in Andhra
Pradesh.
<br>
<br>
In Andhra Pradesh there are three kinds of
uranium mineralisation in the Cuddapah Basin,
including unconformity-related deposits in the
north of it. The northern Lambapur-Peddagattu
project in Nalgonda district 110 km southeast of
Hyderabad has environmental clearance for one
open cut and three small underground mines
(based on some 6000 tU resources at about
0.1%U) but faces local opposition. In August
2007 the government approved a new US$ 270
million underground mine and mill at
Tummalapalle near Pulivendula in Kadapa
district, at the south end of the Basin and 300
km south of Hyderabad, for commissioning has
been initiated. A further northern deposit near
Lambapur-Peddagattu is Koppunuru, in Guntur
district.
In Meghalaya, close to the Bangladesh
border in the West Khasi Hills, the DomiasiatMawthabah mine project (near Nongbah-Jynrin)
is in a high rainfall area and has also faced
longstanding local opposition partly related to
land acquisition issues but also fanned by a
campaign of fear mongering. For this reason, and
despite clear state government support in
principle, UCIL does not yet have approval from
the state government for the open cut mine at
Kylleng-Pyndeng-Shahiong (also known as
Kylleng-Pyndengshohiong-Mawthabah and
formerly as Domiasiat) though pre-project
development has been authorised on 422 ha.
India's Forest and Environment Ministry has
given clearance to the UCIL to start uranium
mining in Meghalaya. UCIL has earmarked an
investment of $229-million to develop the
uranium reserves in Meghalaya. However, the
environmental approval in December 2007 for
a proposed uranium mine and processing plant
here and for the Nongstin mine has been
reported. There is sometimes violent opposition
by NGOs to uranium mine development in the
West Khasi Hills, including at Domiasiat and
Wakhyn, which have estimated resources of 9500
tU and 4000 tU respectively. Tyrnai is a smaller
deposit in the area. The status and geography of
all these is not known. The clearance comes
despite decades of opposition to uranium
exploration and mining in the province by locals
claiming to be victims of radiation and toxic
waste resulting from exploratory drillings by
UCIL. However, plans for an opencast mine to
extract the mineral from the West Khasi Hills
have been hanging fire since 1992 on fears of
radiation and environmental hazards.
<br>
<br>
However, India has reserves of 290,000
tonnes of thorium - about one quarter of the
world total, and these are intended to fuel its
nuclear power programme for a longer-term.
In September 2009 state-owned oil company
ONGC proposed to form a joint venture with
UCIL to explore for uranium in Assam.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Uranium Imports</i></strong></div>

By December 2008, Russia's Rosatom and
Areva from France had contracted to supply
uranium for power generation, while
Kazakhstan, Brazil and South Africa were
preparing to do so. The Russian agreement was
to provide fuel for PHWRs as well as the two
small Tarapur reactors, the Areva agreement was
to supply 300 tU.
In February 2009 the actual Russian contract
was signed with TVEL to supply 2000 tonnes of
natural uranium fuel pellets for PHWRs over ten
years, costing $780 million, and 58 tonnes of lowenriched fuel pellets for the Tarapur reactors.
The Areva shipment arrived in June 2009. RAPS2 became the first PHWR to be fuelled with
imported uranium, followed by units 5 & 6 there.
In January 2009 NPCIL signed a
memorandum of understanding with
Kazatomprom for supply of 2100 tonnes of
uranium concentrate over six years and a
feasibility study on building Indian PHWR
reactors in Kazakhstan. Under this agreement,
300 tonnes of natural uranium was to come from
Kazakhstan in the 2010-11 year. Another 210 t
would come from Russia. A further agreement
in April 2011 covered 2100 tonnes by 2014. In
March 2013 both countries agreed to extend the
civil nuclear cooperation agreement past 2014.
In September 2009 India signed uranium
supply and nuclear cooperation agreements with
Namibia and Mongolia. In March 2010 Russia
offered India a stake in the Elkon uranium
mining development in its Sakha Republic, and
agreed on a joint venture with ARMZ Uranium
Holding Co. In 2013 negotiations for a bilateral
supply treaty with Australia were to commence.
In July 2010 the Minister for S&T reported
that India had received 868 tU from France,
Russia & Kazakhstan in the year to date: 300 tU
natural uranium concentrate from Areva, 58 tU
as enriched UO2 pellets from Areva, 210 tU as
natural uranium oxide pellets from TVEL and
300 tU as natural uranium from Kazatomprom.
As of August 2010 the DAE said that seven
reactors (1400 MWe) were using imported fuel
and working at full power, nine reactors (2630
MWe) used domestic uranium.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

The long-term goal of India’s nuclear
programme has been to develop an advanced
heavy-water thorium cycle. The first stage of this
employs the PHWRs fuelled by natural uranium,
and light water reactors, to produce plutonium.
Stage 2 uses fast neutron reactors burning
the plutonium to breed U-233 from thorium. The
blanket around the core will have uranium as
well as thorium, so that further plutonium
(ideally high-fissile Pu) is produced as well as
the U-233.
<br>
<br>
Then in Stage 3, Advanced Heavy Water
Reactors (AHWRs) burn the U-233 from stage 2
and this plutonium with thorium, getting about
two thirds of their power from thorium.
In 2002 the regulatory authority issued
approval to start construction of a 500 MWe
prototype fast breeder reactor at Kalpakkam and
is in an advanced stage of completion,
construction by BHAVINI. The unit is expected
to be operational in 2013, fuelled with uraniumplutonium oxide (the reactor-grade Pu being
from its existing PHWRs). It will have a blanket
with thorium and uranium to breed fissile U233 and plutonium respectively. This will take
India’s ambitious thorium programme to stage
2, and set the scene for eventual full utilisation
of the country’s abundant thorium to fuel
reactors. Six more such 500 MWe fast reactors
have been announced for construction, four of
them by 2020.
So far about one tonne of thorium oxide fuel
has been irradiated experimentally in PHWR
reactors and has reprocessed and some of this
has been reprocessed, according to BARC. A
reprocessing centre for thorium fuels is being set
up at Kalpakkam.
<br>
<br>
Design is largely complete for the first 300
MWe AHWR, though no site has yet been
announced. It will have vertical pressure tubes
in which the light water coolant under high
pressure will boil, circulation being by
convection. A large heat sink - “Gravity-driven
water pool” - with 7000 cubic metres of water is
near the top of the reactor building. In April
2008 an AHWR critical facility was
commissioned at BARC “to conduct a wide
range of experiments, to help validate the reactor
physics of the AHWR through computer codes
and in generating nuclear data about materials,
such as thorium-uranium 233 based fuel, which
have not been extensively used in the past.” It
has all the components of the AHWR’s core
including fuel and moderator, and can be
operated in different modes with various kinds
of fuel in different configurations.
In 2009 the AEC announced some features
of the 300 MWe AHWR – It is mainly a thoriumfuelled reactor with several advanced passive
safety features to enable meeting next generation
safety requirements such as three days grace
period for operator response, elimination of the
need for exclusion zone beyond the plant
boundary, 100-year design life, and high level
of fault tolerance. The advanced safety
characteristics have been verified in a series of
experiments carried out in full-scale test facilities.
Also, per unit of energy produced, the amount
of long-lived minor actinides generated is nearly
half of that produced in current generation Light
Water Reactors. Importantly, a high level of
radioactivity in the fissile and fertile materials
recovered from the used fuel of AHWR, and their
isotopic composition, preclude the use of these
materials for nuclear weapons.
<br>
<br>
At the same time the AEC announced an
LEU version of the AHWR. This will use lowenriched uranium plus thorium as a fuel,
dispensing with the plutonium input. About
39% of the power will come from thorium (via
in situ conversion to U-233, of two thirds in
AHWR), and burn-up will be 64 GWd/t.
Uranium enrichment level will be 19.75%, giving
4.21% average fissile content of the U-Th fuel.
Plutonium production will be less than in light
water reactors, and the fissile proportion will be
less and the Pu-238 portion three times as high,
giving inherent proliferation resistance. The
design is intended for overseas sales, and the
AEC says that “the reactor is manageable with
modest industrial infrastructure within the reach
of developing countries”.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NUCLEAR ENERGY PARKS IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

In line with past practice such as at the 
eightunit Rajasthan nuclear plant, NPCIL intends to
set up five more "Nuclear Energy Parks", each
with a capacity for up to eight new-generation
reactors of 1,000 MWe, six reactors of 1600 MWe
or simply 10,000 MWe at a single location. By
2032, 40-45 GWe would be provided from these
five. NPCIL says it is confident of being able to
start work by 2012 on at least four new reactors
at all four sites designated for imported plants.
The new energy parks are to be:
<br>
<br>
<b>Kudankulam in Tamil Nadu:</b> Three more
pairs of Russian VVER units, making 9200 MWe.
Environmental approval has been given for the
first four. A general framework agreement for
construction of units 3 & 4 was planned to be
signed in mid 2010, with equipment supply and
service contracts soon after, but these were
delayed on account of supplier liability questions,
with India wanting the units to come under its
2010 vendor liability law. In July 2012 Russia
agreed to $3.5 billion in export financing for
units 3 & 4, to cover 85% of their cost. A further
credit line of $800 million is available to cover
fuel supplies. The credit lines carry interest at
4% pa and would be repayable over 14 years
and 4 years respectively, from one year after the
start of power generation. The Indian
government said it expected to take up the credit
offers to the value of $3.06 billion, about 53% of
the $5.78 billion estimated total project cost. In
March 2013 cabinet approved construction of
units 3 & 4, and site work began.
<br>
<b>Jaitapur in Maharashtra:</b> An EUR 7 billion
framework agreement with Areva was signed
in December 2010 for the first two EPR reactors,
along with 25 years supply of fuel. Environmental approval has been given for these, and
site work was planned to start in 2011 with a
view to 2013 for construction. In July 2009 Areva
submitted a bid to NPCIL to build the first two
EPR units, which will have Alstom turbinegenerators, accounting for about 30% of the total
EUR 7 billion plant cost. The site will host six
units, providing 9600 MWe. Areva now hopes
to obtain export credit financing and sign a
contract which would put the first two units on
line in 2020 and 2021. In 2013 negotiations
continued and the government said it expected
the cost of the first two units to be 1,20,000 crore
($21 billion).
<br>
<br>
Mithi Virdi in Gujarat will host up to six
Westinghouse AP1000 units built in three
satages. NPCIL says it has initiated pre-project
activities here, with groundbreaking in 2012. A
preliminary environmental assessment for the
whole project was completed in January 2013.
Westinghouse signed an agreement with NPCIL
in June 2012 to launch negotiations for an early
works agreement which was expected in a few
months. The first stage of two units is due on
line in 2019-20, the others to 2024.
Kovvada in Andhra Pradesh will host six
GE Hitachi ESBWR units. GE Hitachi said in June
2012 that it expected soon to complete an early
works agreement with NPCIL to set terms for
obtaining approval from the Government for the
project. Site preparation is under way, and a
preliminary environmental assessment is being
prepared.
Haripur in West Bengal to host four or six
further Russian VVER-1200 units, making 4800
MWe. NPCIL says it has initiated pre-project
activities here, with groundbreaking planned for
2012. However, strong local opposition led the
West Bengal government to reject the proposal
in August 2011, and change of site to Orissa state
has been suggested.
<br>
<br>
Kumharia and Gorakhpur in the
Fatehabad district in Haryana is earmarked for
four indigenous 700 MWe PHWR units and the
AEC had approved the state's proposal for a 2800
MWe nuclear power plant.
 Bargi or Chuttka in Madhya Pradesh is
also designated for two indigenous 700 MWe
PHWR units.
At Markandi (Pati Sonapur) in Orissa there
are plans for up to 6000 MWe of PWR capacity.
NUKE COMMAND
Formalizing the country’s nuclear command
and control structure, India’s cabinet on January
4, 2003 decided to place ultimate control of the
country’s nuclear forces in the hands of a
political council chaired by then Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee. It took more than four and
a half years after declaring itself a nuclear
weapon power, to make public a set of political
principles and administrative arrangement to
manage its arsenal of atomic weapons. The
Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) met to
review progress in implementing India’s nuclear
doctrine, the state of readiness of its strategic
forces and the procedures for their command
and control.
<br>
<br>
Through the CCS statement the government
has tried to share information on some key
aspects of its nuclear weapons management
with the Indian public and the world. Although
the broad outline of India’s nuclear doctrine was
known for a while, the nature of its command
and control over the atomic arsenal had
remained unclear.
<br>
<br>
<b>N-Command Structure:</b> The government
accounted the formation of “Nuclear Command
Authority” (NCA) which will be solely
responsible for ordering a nuclear strike. The
NCA will have two bodies: Political council and
Executive council.
<br>
<b>Political Council:</b> Political council is the sole
body, which can authorize the use of nuclear
weapon. It represents the civilian leadership. As
the first among equal, the Prime Minister will
symbolically have his finger on the nuclear
button. An alternative chain of command has
also been approved to take charge in case the
command chain is disturbed in any way. It has
not been made public besides the Prime Minister,
as the chairperson, the political council will also
be represented by the Home Minister, the
Defence Minister, the Foreign Minister and the
Finance Minister.
<br>
<b>Executive Council:</b> The executive council
chaired by the National Security Advisor to the
Prime Minister, will provide inputs for decision
making by the National command Authority and
execute the directives given to it by the Political
council. The real strength of the council has not
been announced by the Cabinet Committee on
Security.
<br>
<br>
The cabinet committee also approved the
appointment of a “Commander-in-chief,
strategic forces command” who would be
responsible for the administration of the nuclear
force. It will be the custodian of all nuclear
weapons and delivery systems. It will also
formulate the strategy for retaliation and advise
the chiefs of staff committee and actually fire the
nukes. A senior officer of the Indian Air Force is
expected to be nominated to the post. Once the
“chief of staff committee” receives inputs from
the strategic forces command, it will provide
military advice to the political council of the
nuclear command authority through the
executive council. The final decision has to be
made by the leader (Prime Minister) in his
individual capacity based on military advice,
especially when one is going to act only in
retaliation.
The security committee expressed
satisfaction with the overall preparedness of its
arsenal and reiterated the decision to limit India’s
capability to a “credible minimum deterrent” and
the commitment to use nuclear weapons only in
retaliation. India also reaffirmed that it would
not use the weapons against non-nuclear
weapon powers. Against nuclear weapon
powers, its strategy would remain on the policy
of “No-first use”. India is committed not to use
nuclear arms first in any conflict, but only in
retaliation for a nuclear attack against it or its
forces. But in the event of a major attack
involving chemical or biological weapons, India
reserves the right to use nuclear weapons.
The nuclear draft doctrine was released by
the National Security Advisory Board set up after
May 1998 tests, in August 1999. The
announcement has confirmed the essence of that
draft as official policy. The only new element in
the doctrine is the interesting caveat it has
introduced to its No-first use posture. The United
States has retained a similar option to prevent
nations with chemical and biological weapons
from assuming that the use of these weapons of
mass destruction will not invite a nuclear
response. While India has consciously chosen not
to use nuclear weapons first, it warned potential
adversaries that the nuclear retaliation to a first
strike will be massive and designed to inflict
unacceptable damage.
<br>
<br>
<b>Alternative N-Command:</b> India has more
than one alternative nuclear command structure
in place. In the event of a surprise attack, these
alternative command authorities will be in
position to take retaliatory action. An alternative
command puts the final touch to India’s nuclear
deterrent. If an enemy knows that such a
command exists, but does not know where they
are; this will deter a surprise attack.
India may have two or three alternative
command structures. Both the location and
nature of the command will remain a secret. This
will never be disclosed. The succession ladder of
various officials had also been worked out.
During the Kargil war and mobilization crisis,
India had made adequate preparation on the
nuclear front and could have retaliated if there
had been any need.
<br>
<br>
The civil chain of command has also not been
made public. In a setting in which the Prime
Minister who has been vested with the sole
authority over the nuclear button, is unable to
function, conventional nuclear command and
control hierarchy demands that the next in the
line of succession be identified. In the US, for
instance, where the President has authority over
the nuclear button, the structure identifies 16
others in the line of succession.
India has also full-fledged delivery system.
There are multiple agencies tasked with
responsibility on nuclear issues. Some of these,
like the Department of Atomic Energy are Civil
and some, like the Army’s 333 Missiles Group,
are military. India’s Prithvi and Agni missiles and
its Mi ranges and Sukoi-30 fighter bombers are
nuclear capable. A sea based nuclear deterrent
will be ready once India has submarine-launched
cruise missile.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIAN NUCLEAR DRAFT</i></strong></div>

The acquisition of an advanced nuclear
weapon capability also necessitated the
formulation of a nuclear draft. It was in this
context that the Indian Nuclear Draft was
released by National Security Advisory Board of
India on 17 Aug. 1999. This document prepared
on India’s nuclear doctrine was designed for
informal public debate, details regarding the
configuration of nuclear forces and targeting
schemes flowing from the broad framework.
The prime objective of India is to achieve
economic, political, social, scientific and
technological developments within a peaceful
and democratic framework. It considers India’s
security as an integral component of its
development process. The notion adheres firmly
to its continued commitment to certain principles
- (a) to restrict the purpose of nuclear weapons
to credible minimum deterrence against nuclear
weapons only and not visualizing use of these
weapons in nuclear scenario and (b) to have
commitment to a policy of ‘no first use’.
The draft earnestly seeks to enhance the
credibility of India’s nuclear deterrence and
acquire adequate retaliatory capability.
Deterrence requires that India maintains: (a)
sufficient survivable and prepared nuclear force;
(b) robust communication & control system; (c)
effective intelligence; (d) comprehensive
planning and training for operations; (e) the will
to employ nuclear forces and weapons. Special
focus is to be given to ensure nuclear safety and
improvement in R&D programmes to sustain
technological advancements. India will focus on
developing a strong disaster control system and
continue to strive for making a nuclear-free
world. In a nutshell, India’s nuclear doctrine
firmly adheres to a tolerant defensive policy as
well as explicitly reflects its nuclear prowess. The
doctrine is indicative of the endurance, tolerance,
strength and greatness of a nuclear India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NUCLEAR POWER VISION</i></strong></div>

The vision 2020 document of 2000 and the
Tenth Five-Year Plan (2002-2007) say nuclear
power is India’s insurance for energy security.
“Aggressively build capabilities and capacity in
nuclear power to progressively raise its share in
India’s fuel mix,” according to the Tenth Five
Year Plan that advocated for more nuclear
energy. To achieve this, it suggested partial
privatisation of nuclear power generation and
market financing for projects.
India would need 500,000 MW of power by
2050. It has a vast coal reserve, but there are
doubts whether all of it can be mined. The
country’s hydrocarbon resources won’t last long
and it will become even more dependent on
imports. India would have harnessed all its
hydroelectricity resources by 2050, and 
nonconventional energy is unlikely to be 
costeffective. A mix of all these resources could help
but DAE feels that nuclear energy is the only
solution, which can fill the gap between
demands and supply. The government agrees
and has decided to cut the estimated 70 per cent
contribution of coal-based power to 62 per cent
by 2020 and compensate the shortfall through
nuclear stations. The government wants that by
2050 nuclear reactors supply 25 per cent of
India’s total power production. The DAE is sure
that it can generate 10,000 MW of nuclear power
by 2010 and 20,000 MW by 2020. Its confidence
is based on an indigenous technology, which
recycles spent fuel of thermal nuclear reactors
to get plutonium for FBRs. The Nuclear Power
Corporation says it will generate 1,300 MW
during the Tenth Five Year Plan and 4,660 MW
during Eleventh Plan to make up for the first
10,000 MW target within the next six years.
<br>
<br>
Three-stage nuclear energy programme aims
at generating 20,000 MW of electricity by 2020.
The programme will begin by using scarce
uranium in the first stage to thorium in the third
stage by 2020.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Stage-I: Twenty-one pressurized heavy
water reactors using natural uranium to generate
10,000 MW of power by 2010.</li>
        <li>Stage-II: Fast breeder reactors (FBRs) will use
plutonium extracted from spent uranium fuel of
Stage-I to generate 10,000 MW by 2020, which
means 12.5 per cent of India’s electricity need.</li>
        <li>Stage III: Advanced heavy water reactors
to use plutonium and new fuel of thorium.
India’s 3,00,000 tonnes of thorium supposed to
produce electricity for 400 years.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION</i></strong></div>

As per the current definition, Nuclear
proliferation includes, apart from acquisition of
nuclear weapons, the acquisition of fissionable
materials like plutonium and enriched uranium
and also the ability to produce them.
Nuclear proliferation can be accomplished
in two ways, horizontal and vertical. If nonnuclear regions or states become nuclear powers,
it is the case of horizontal proliferation. A nuclear
power state when goes on adding to its nuclear
arsenal, the case is of vertical proliferation. The
emphasis on horizontal proliferation totally
ignoring vertical proliferation has been the real
cause of confrontation between the nuclear
haves and have-nots.
<br>
<br>
In order to check the horizontal proliferation
nuclear haves devised various inspection and
control mechanisms based on bilateral accord.
But this was not enough as the fear that nations
may strop around and buy their materials from
states that imposed the least control and even
no controls prompted them to establish
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to
preserve the “long term and safe” foreign

        <li>An agreement between the agency and
the recipient country regarding control
provisions.</li>
        <li>A design of the nuclear facilities under

        <li>Provision of records.</li>
        <li>Reports to the agency based upon the

        <li>Onsite inspection by the agency.
Structural weaknesses of the NPT
<br>
(a) The imbalance in the distribution of
obligations and benefits between the
nuclear weapon powers and the non nuclear
weapon states.
<br>
(b) The omission of any reference to the
vertical proliferation in the treaty.
<br>
(c) The technological denials embodied in the
discriminatory provisions regarding
safeguards (Art. III), right to peaceful uses
of nuclear energy (Art. IV) and right to
peaceful nuclear explosives PNEs (Art. V).
<br>
(d) The omission of nuclear security
guarantees to non-nuclear weapon states
in the Treaty.
<br>
(e) The fragile UN resolution 225 on nuclear
security guarantee in 1968.</li>

</ol>

Political Instrument Devised by the Super
Powers
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To perpetuate the status quo and the
hierarchical character of the international
system.</li>
        <li>To restrict the nuclear club membership
only to five nuclear weapon powers.</li>
        <li>To establish a clientele relationship
between the nuclear powers and the nonnuclear powers.</li>
        <li>To sharply divide nations into the nuclear

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>N-safety & Regulation</i></strong></div>

The nuclear safety in India is regulated by
an autonomous body, the Atomic Energy
Regulatory Board (AERB) established under
section 27 of the Atomic Energy Act, 1962 on 15
Nov. 1983. Moreover, in recent times, environmental issues have assumed significance mainly
for ensuring sustainable development in all
spheres. The AERB has issued the guidelines
fixing the upper limit for radiation annually
which is 30 mSv. Besides, the BARC has set up a
Health Safety and Environmental Group in the
premises of every nuclear power plant to monitor
radiation.
<br>
<br>
In fact, the AERB together with the Safety
Review Committee for Operating Plants
(SARCOP) is responsible for regulating the safety
standards. In order to deal with nuclear
emergencies, a Crisis Management Group
(CMG) was constituted in 1987, which comprises
members from organisations like NPCIL, BARC,
AERB, HWB (Heavy Water Board) etc. With a
view to managing the crises situation, the DAE
has identified an Exclusion Zone of 1.6 km
surrounding the power station where habitation
has been prohibited. Besides, an area of 16 km
radius around the plant has been identified as
the EPZ.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIA AND NPT</i></strong></div>

After the end of the Second World War, the
world which had experienced the catastrophic
effect of atom bomb embarked on the path not
to have a repetition of nuclear history. After
eighteen years of futile discussions a series of
substantial developments got its origin and its
manifestation came in the form of Partial Test
Ban Treaty, 1963. The process yielded a very
important and relevant treaty in 1968 known as
Non proliferation Treaty or NTP. This treaty
prohibits further spread of nuclear weapons. The
decade of 1970, which was declared as
Disarmament Decade by U.N. had an auspicious
starting by having 43 countries ratifying the
treaty. Thus the treaty came into force on 5
March, 1970. A total of 190 parties joined the
Treaty, with five states being recognized as
nuclear-weapon states: the United States, Russia,
the United Kingdom, France, and China.
The Indian stand is that it has refused to sign
the treaty on the ground that it is discriminatory
and unequal. The official stand of India over the
treaty was in crystal clear manner aircasted by
Mr. K. P. Unnikrishnan in U. N. General
Assembly that India would not subscribe to a
treaty of an attitude that divides the world into
haves and have-nots.
<br>
<br>
The NPT professes for a world where five
countries would have nuclear weapons and rest
of the countries would be devoid of it as the
proliferations of nuclear weapon is prohibited
under the treaty. It tantamounts to nuclear
hegemony creating an inequality in the world
order. India says that it can become a part of
treaty, but first there should be complete
disarmament. Despite several resolutions and
treaties, no substantial development has been
done by NWS (Nuclear Weapon States). It is a
matter of great concern to India’s security, as
we have China and Pakistan as nuclear states.
The government of India is in favour of
expansion of exclusive club of nuclear power by
induction of it. So, NPT has to be genuine to its
goal, either we have a range of states having
nuclear war heads to balance global power or
all the countries of the world adopt a totally
nuclear weapons free world. However, in the
light of recent tests of China and France and
proposed NMD of US and its withdrawal from
ABM 1972, there is not much light of hope.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIA AND CTBT</i></strong></div>

The another very substantial step, to get a
world in which there would be supremacy of
five countries rather than a world free from
nuclear weapon, was taken in June 1995 in
Geneva to adopt the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT). The treaty contains a
comprehensive plan to prohibit nuclear tests. The
treaty comprised 154 countries and verified by
51 countries before a review conference was held
in Vienna in October 1999. The ratification of
America and China is required to get the treaty
into force. But these countries have not yet
ratified it and one of the bizarre points is that
America, that preaches other countries to sign
it, didn’t get it approved by its Senate as they
treated it as against the interest of US security.
Russia signed the treaty on Sep 24, 1996 and
ratified it on Jun 30, 2000.
<br>
<br>
The 44 countries, including five nuclear
powers are considered as having nuclear
capability. Out of 44, 41 countries have signed
it, while 26 countries have ratified it. As of June
2013, 159 states had ratified the CTBT and
another 24 states signed it but not ratified it.
There are 183 signatories of CTBT.
India opposes the treaty on the ground that
it doesn’t speak about destruction of existing
nuclear stockpiles. The treaty doesn’t contain any
time bound destruction programme. So
according to the treaty, disarmament of the
weapons would solely depend on the attitude
of NWS. The recent tests of China, France and
US, underground subcritical tests of Nevada put
a huge question mark on their intention. The
recent development in US Congress and
withdrawal from ABM clearly shows that future
is by no way going to be nuclear free world.
In such a condition India says that her
security concerns demand nuclear power, as we
have in our surrounding nuclear China and
Pakistan. India is willing to have a consensus
over CTBT in country only if some of her
demands are conceded. It demands that India
should be included in the club of NWS and
countries having nuclear arms should go for a
comprehensive programme for disarmament
with specific time bound resolution.
But no proper attention is given to our
demands and India has refused to become a
party of the treaty. The self moratorium imposed
by India is an example of our stand that, our
nuclear programme is only for alternate purpose.
The commitment becomes more authentic with
our proposal of ‘no first use’ which was rejected
by Pakistan.
<br>
<br>
India has been voicing since 1960 in favour
of disarmament and has actively participated in
it. But it is against a global order where some
countries have weapons of mass destruction and
the rest are at their mercy. We aspire for a world
based on equality and respect for each other.
India believes in peace based on cooperation, and
not under the cover of fear.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>India’s Objections</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>No time frame to denuclearize the five

        <li>Treaty allows withdrawal without

        <li>The Treaty is not comprehensive; it bans

    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDO-US NUCLEAR DEAL</i></strong></div>

In the current scenario, the then President
George W. Bush called India a natural partner
of the United States and his Administration
sought to assist India’s rise as a major power. In
July 2005, President Bush and Indian Prime
Minister Manmohan Singh issued a Joint
Statement resolving to establish a global
partnership between their two countries through
increased cooperation on numerous economic,
security, and global issues. In this Joint Statement,
the Bush Administration dubbed India a
responsible state with advanced nuclear
technology and vowed to achieve full civilian
nuclear energy cooperation with India.
The Joint Statement acknowledged that
India’s nuclear programme has both a military
and a civilian component. Both sides agreed that
the purpose was not to constrain India’s strategic
programme but to enable resumption of full civil
nuclear energy cooperation in order to enhance
global energy and environmental security. Such
cooperation was predicated on the assumption
that any international civil nuclear energy
cooperation (including by the US) offered to
India in the civilian sector should, firstly, not be
diverted away from civilian purposes, and
secondly, should not be transferred from India
to third countries without safeguards. These
concepts will be reflected in the Safeguards
Agreement to be negotiated by India with
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Principles which Guided India</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Credible, feasible, and implementable in
a transparent manner;</li>
        <li>Consistent with India’s national security
and R&D requirements as well as not
prejudicial to the three-stage nuclear
programme in India;</li>
        <li>Must be cost effective in its
implementation;</li>
        <li>Must be acceptable to Parliament and
public opinion.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Based on these principles, India will:
Include in the civilian list only those facilities
offered for safeguards that, after separation, will
no longer be engaged in activities of strategic
significance.
<br>
<br>
The overarching criterion would be a
judgement whether subjecting a facility to IAEA
safeguards would impact adversely on India’s
national security.
However, a facility will be excluded from the
civilian list if it is located in a larger hub of
strategic significance, notwithstanding the fact
that it may not be normally engaged in activities
of strategic significance.
A civilian facility would therefore, be one that
India has determined not to be relevant to its
strategic programme.
Taking the above into account, India, on the
basis of reciprocal action by the US, would like
to adopt the following approach:
Thermal Power Reactors: India will identify
and offer for safeguards 14 thermal power
reactors between 2006 and 2014. This will
include the 4 presently safeguarded reactors
(TAPS 1&2, RAPS 1&2) and in addition KK 1&2
that are under construction and other PHWRs,
each of a capacity of 220MW, will also be offered.
Phasing of specific thermal power reactors,
being offered for safeguards would be indicated
separately by India. Such an offer would, in
effect, cover 14 out of the 22 thermal power
reactors in operation or currently under
construction to be placed under safeguards, and
would raise the total installed Thermal Power
capacity by MWs under safeguards from the
present 19% to 65% by 2014.
<br>
<br>
<b>Fast Breeder Reactors:</b> India is not in a
position to accept safeguards on the Prototype
Fast Breeder Reactors (PFBR) and the Fast
Breeder Test Reactor (FBTR), both located at
Kalpakkam. The Fast Breeder Programme is at
the R&D stage and its technology will take time
to mature and reach an advanced stage of
development.
<br>
<b>Future Reactors:</b> India has decided to place
under safeguards all future civilian thermal
power reactors and civilian breeder reactors, and
the Government of India retains the sole right to
determine such reactors as civilian.
Research Reactors: India will permanently
shut down the CIRUS reactor. It will also be
prepared to shift the fuel core of the APSARA
reactor that was purchased from France outside
BARC and make the fuel core available to be
placed under safeguards.
<br>
<b>Upstream facilities:</b>
The following upstream facilities would be
identified and separated as civilian:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>List of those specific facilities in the
nuclear fuel complex, which will be
offered for safeguards.</li>
            <li>The heavy water production plants at
Thal, Tuticorin and Hazira are proposed
to be designated for civilian use. We do
not consider these plants as relevant for
safeguards purposes.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

    <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Downstream facilities:</i></strong></div>

The following downstream facilities would
be identified and separated as civilian.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>India is willing to accept safeguards in
the ‘campaign’ mode in respect of the
Tarapur power reactor fuel reprocessing
plant.</li>
        <li>The Tarapur and Rajasthan away from
reactors’ spent fuel storage pools would
be made available for safeguards with
appropriate phasing.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<b>Research Facilities:</b> India will declare the
following facilities as civilian:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</li>
        <li>Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre</li>
        <li>Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics</li>
        <li>Institute for Plasma Research</li>
        <li>Institute of Mathematics Science</li>
        <li>Institute of Physics</li>
        <li>Tata Memorial Centre</li>
        <li>Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology</li>
        <li>Harish Chandra Research Institute</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These facilities are safeguards-irrelevant. It
is our expectation that they will play a prominent
role in international cooperation.
Safeguards
The United States has conveyed its
commitment to the reliable supply of fuel to
India. Consistent with the July 18, 2005, Joint
Statement, the United States has also reaffirmed
its assurance to create the necessary conditions
for India to have assured and full access to fuel
for its reactors.
<br>
<br>
To further guard against any disruption of
fuel supplies, the United States is prepared to
take the following additional steps:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The United States is willing to incorporate
assurances regarding fuel supply in the
bilateral U.S.-India agreement on peaceful
uses of nuclear energy under Section 123
of the U.S. Atomic Energy Act, which
would be submitted to the U.S. Congress.</li>
        <li>The United States will join India in
seeking to negotiate with the IAEA an
India-specific fuel supply agreement.</li>
        <li>The United States will support an Indian
effort to develop a strategic reserve of
nuclear fuel to guard against any
disruption of supply over the lifetime of
India’s reactors.</li>
        <li>If despite these arrangements, a disruption
of fuel supplies to India occurs, the United
States and India would jointly convene a
group of friendly supplier countries like
Russia, France and the United Kingdom
to pursue such measures as would restore
fuel supply to India.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
In the light of the above understanding with
the United States, an India-specific safeguards
agreement will be negotiated between India and
the IAEA providing for safeguards to guard
against withdrawal of safeguarded nuclear
material from civilian use at any time as well as
providing for corrective measures that India may
take to ensure uninterrupted operation of its
civilian nuclear reactors in the event of disruption
of foreign fuel supplies. Taking this into account,
India will place its civilian nuclear facilities under
India-specific safeguards in perpetuity and
negotiate an appropriate safeguards agreement
to this end with the IAEA. This plan is in
conformity with the commitments made to
Parliament.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NUCLEAR POLLUTION</i></strong></div>

It is not only the use of fossil fuels that
pollutes our surroundings; even the use of
nuclear energy gives rise to pollutants and,
hence, pollutes our environment. In fact, the
pollution caused by the use of nuclear energy
from fission process is much more damaging
than the pollution caused by burning fossil fuels.
The fuels like U-235 are radio-active substances,
which keep on emitting some nuclear radiations
all the time.
The dangerous nuclear radiations can enter
into the environment by leakage from nuclear
reactors where fission of U-235 is going on. These
nuclear radiations can damage and cause
irreparable damage to cells and in some cases
even lead to death.
<br>
<br>
The waste material produced during the
various steps of the nuclear energy production
is collectively known as nuclear wastes. These
are harmful nuclear radiations. If these
radioactive wastes are dumped in garbage bins,
they will emit nuclear radiations, and pose a
threat to the life of humans and animals. Also if
they are dumped in rivers or sea, they will
contaminate water and damage aquatic life. So,
there is a great problem of disposal of nuclear
waste.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NUCLEAR WASTE MANAGEMENT</i></strong></div>

No discussion on nuclear power is complete
without consideration of safety and
environmental factors. These are issues of
legitimate concern to the public in the aftermath
of the Chernobyl accident and because of the
alarming scenarios of nuclear power appearing
in the media. More than 99 per cent of the total
radioactivity in the entire nuclear fuel cycle is
generated from the fuel processing plants. To
ensure that this highly radioactive waste stream
does not pose any hazards to the environment,
a three-stage approach has been adopted. First,
the waste will be incorporated in stable and inert
solid matrices. The conditioned waste will then
be placed in canisters and kept in a retrievable
store under cooling and constant surveillance.
Ultimately, the canisters will be stored in suitable
geological media.
<br>
<br>
A waste immobilization plant for
incorporating the high level radioactive wastes
generated from the fuel processing plants is set
up along with the solid storage surveillance
facility of Tarapur. Immobilization involves
verification of radioactive waste, which is coded
at underground disposal. The canisters in storage
will be air-cooked by natural convection and
when the heat and the radioactivity in canisters
decay to desired level, they will be transported
to a suitable geological formation for ultimate
storage. The work on identifying suitable
geological formations for ultimate disposal has
been completed and a graveyard for storage of
nuclear wastes has been established in Trombay.
