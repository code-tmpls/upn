<h3>Defence</h3>

The Supreme Command of the Armed
Forces vests with the President of India. The
responsibility for national defence rests with the
Cabinet. This is discharged through the Ministry
of Defence, which provides the policy
framework and wherewithal to the Armed
Forces to discharge their responsibilities in the
context of the defence of the country. The
Defence Minister is the head of the Ministry of
Defence. The principal task of the Defence
Ministry is to obtain policy directions of the
Government on all defence and security related
matters and communicate them for
implementation to the Services Headquarters,
Inter-Services Organizations, Production
Establishments and Research and Development
Organisations. It is also required to ensure
effective implementation of the Government•fs
policy directions and the execution of approved
programmes within the allocated resources.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Department of Defence Production</i></strong></div>

The Department of Defence Production was
set up in 1962, in the aftermath of the Chinese
aggression to create a self-reliant and selfsufficient indigenous defence production base.
In November, 1965, Department of Defence
Supplies was created to forge linkages between
the civil industries and defence production units.
The two departments were merged in December,
1984 into the Department of Defence Production
and Supplies. The Department of Defence
Production and Supplies has been renamed as
Department of Defence Production w.e.f.
January, 2004.
Since 1962, 39 Ordnance factories have been
set up and two projects, coming up at Nalanda
in Bihar and Korwa in U.P. Their capacities
have been augmented and modernised
selectively keeping in mind the emerging
requirements of the Armed Forces. All the
Ordnance Factories and Defence Public Sector
Undertaking (DPSUs) are engaged in the task
of manufacture of equipment and stores for
Defence Services. The products manufactured
include arms and ammunition, tanks, armoured
vehicles, heavy vehicles, fighter aircraft and
helicopters, warships, submarines, missiles,
ammunition, electronic equipment, earth moving
equipment, special alloys and special purpose
steels. In addition, capacities of civil sectors are
also utilised for the purpose. The following
DPSUs are functioning under the administrative
control of the Department:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL)</li>
        <li>Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)</li>
        <li>Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML)</li>
        <li>Mazagon Dock Ltd (MDL)</li>
        <li>Goa Shipyard Limited (GSL)</li>
        <li>Hindustan Shipyard Limited (HSL)</li>
        <li>Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineers Limited (GRSE)</li>

        <li>Ordinance Factory Board (OFB)</li>
        <li>Mishra Dhatu Nigam Limited (MIDHANI)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In addition, the following organisations are
also associated with the Department of Defence
Production for the technical support:-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA)</li>
        <li>Directorate of Standardisation (DOS)</li>
        <li>Directorate General of Aeronautical Quality Assurance (DGAQA)</li>
        <li>Directorate of Planning & Coordination (Dte. of P&C)</li>
        <li>Defence Exhibition Organisation (DEO)</li>
        <li>National Institute for Research &
Development in Defence Shipbuilding
(NIRDESH)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These Defence Production Units have
become self reliant, progressively. Additional
capacities have been built up and new items have
been productionised. These include the main
battle tank Arjun, the Advanced Light
Helicopter (ALH) and a range of 155 mm
ammunition.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO)</i></strong></div>

Providing a solid base to the national security
system, Defence Research and Development
Organisation (DRDO) was formed in 1958 by
amalgamating Defence Science Organisation
and some of the technical development
establishments. A separate department of
Defence Research and Development was formed
in 1980 which now administers DRDO and its
48 laboratories and establishments. The
Department of Defence Research and
Development formulates and executes
programmes of scientific research, design and
development in the fields of relevance to national
security, leading to the induction of new
weapons, platforms and other equipments
required by the Armed Forces. It also functions
as the nodal agency for the execution of major
development programmes of relevance to
defence through integration of research,
development, testing and production facilities
with the national scientific institutions, public
sector undertakings and other agencies. It
functions under the control of scientific advisor
to Defence Minister who is also Secretary,
Defence Research and Development.
<br>
<br>
<b>Contribution of DRDO:</b> DRDO has made
great strides since 1980 towards making our
armed forces self reliant. On the one hand this
has enabled our Armed Forces to face the arms
export control regimes of advanced countries,
whereas on the other hand, DRDO has
progressively enhanced their combat
effectiveness through development of state-ofthe-art indigenous defence systems. During last
few years, a number of defence systems and
equipments have been productionised. These
include:

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIA'S DEFENCE POLICY</i></strong></div>

The main objectives of India•fs defence
policy are to (a) promote and sustain durable
peace in the subcontinent and (b) equip the
defence forces adequately to safeguard the
territorial integrity of the country against foreign
aggression. In the field of defence research, India
has achieved great success and owing to defence
scientists, India, today is in the short list of some
developed nations of the world who have
capabilities to produce modern defence arsenals.
India is the third largest importer of arms and
equipment in the world.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Integrated Guided Missile Programme</i></strong></div>

The Integrated Guided Missile Development
Program (IGMDP) was formed in 1983 with the
aim of achieving self-sufficiency in missile
development & production and today comprises
of five core missile programs •\the strategic
Agni ballistic missile, the tactical Prithvi ballistic
missile, the Akash and Trishul surface-to-air
missiles and the Nag anti-tank guided missile.
The program has given India the capability to
produce indigenous missiles in other key areas.
By enforcing the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR) to stop supplies of all kinds of
missile material, Western nations are trying to
prevent India from developing these strategic
and tactical missiles. Undaunted by this 
highlevel conspiracy, hats off to all the brilliant
Indian scientists who have toiled so hard, in their
dedicated efforts, that they managed to develop
these missiles.
<br>
<br>
In India IGMDP comprises of following
missiles developed by DRDO:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Surface to surface missile: Prithvi</li>
        <li>Surface to air medium range missile: Akash</li>
        <li>Anti-tank missile: Nag</li>
        <li>Surface-to-air short range missile:
Trishul</li>
        <li>Intermediate range ballistic missile
(IRBM): Agni</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Difference between Cruise Missile and InterBallistic Missile
Cruise missile is an unmanned self-propelled
guided vehicle that sustains flight through
aerodynamic lift for most of its flight path and
whose primary mission is to place a payload on
a target. They fly within the earth•fs atmosphere
and use jet engine technology. These vehicles
vary greatly in their speed and ability to
penetrate defences. These can be classified as:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Subsonic cruise missile</li>
            <li>Supersonic cruise missile</li>
            <li>Hypersonic cruise missiles</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

Ballistic missiles follow ballistic trajectory i.e.
first moves to outer space and then enters earth
atmosphere and strike the target. Ballistic missiles
are categorized according to their range, the
maximum distance measured along the surface
of the earth•fs ellipsoid from the point of launch
of a ballistic missile to the point of impact of the
last element of its payload. These can be classified
as:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Intercontinental Ballistic Missile</li>
        <li>Intermediate-Range Ballistic Missile</li>
        <li>Medium-Range Ballistic Missile</li>
        <li>Short-Range Ballistic missile</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Brief introduction of important missiles</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Prithvi</i></strong></div>
            
<b>Type:</b> Short range, surface-to-surface
battlefield tactical missile.
<br>
<b>Range:</b> 150 km with 1000 kg warhead and
250 km with 500 kg warhead (minimum 40 km)
<br>
<b>Payload:</b> 500-1000 kg
<br>
<b>Warhead:</b> Both conventional and nuclear,
pre-fragmented and bomblets
<br>
<b>Propulsion:</b> Single stage, liquid propellant
<br>
<b>Description:</b> The use of Prithvi is visualized
as phases of preparatory and subsequent phases
of the battle to destroy enemy concentration of
tanks and troops, logistic installations, airfields
and communication facilities. It is difficult to spot
the Prithvi or trace its trajectory and target
because of its supersonic speed and limited flight
time. The missile is extremely accurate (its
circular error probability- CEP- is lower than
most missile of its class) - with a circular accuracy
of 10m. The short-range version is for the Indian
Army and long-range for IAF.
<br>
<br>
The Air Force version, designated as 
the SS250 had a range of 250 km and could carry up
to a maximum of a 500 kg as its payload. By
using boosted liquid propellant to generate more
thrust-to-weight ratio, DRDO has increased the
payload of the SS-250 to 1000 kg. The Prithvi
reportedly has the highest warhead-weight to
overall-weight of any missile in its class.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Agni</i></strong></div>
            
<b>Type:</b> Surface-to-surface, Intermediate
Range Ballistic Missile (IRBM)
<br>
<b>Range:</b> 700 km - 5000 km
<br>
<b>Payload:</b> 500 kg - 1000 kg; Multipurpose.
<br>
<b>Propulsion:</b> Two stage, first stage uses solid
propellant while second stage uses twin liquid
propellant engines.
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Agni is a re-entry technology
demonstrator. It is capable of carrying a
multipurpose payload. One of its unique features
is the heat shield of the re-entry vehicle.
<br>
<b>Tested:</b> First successful test of Agni took
place on 22nd May, 1989. After this test, India
became sixth nation-along with USA, Russia,
France, China and Israel who have tested IRBM.
In April 1999 India tested its Agni-II missile at
Balasore (Odisha) successfully. Range of Agni-
II is more than 2500 km. A shorter variant of
Agni- Agni-1 was successfully test-fired in
January 2002. Its range is about 700 km.
<br>
<br>
<b>Agni-III Missile:</b>
On September 21, 2012 India test-fired the
3000 km range surface-to-surface nuclear
capable Agni-III missile from the Wheelers•f
Island off Odisha coast. Agni-3 is the country•fs
first solid fuel missile that is compact and small
enough for easy mobility and can be easily
packaged for deployment on a variety of surface
and sub-surface platform. Agni-III is an
intermediate-range ballistic missile with a range
of 3,500 km- 5,000 km. The missile•fs Circular
Error Probable (CEP) is within 40 meters range,
which makes it the most sophisticated and
accurate ballistic missile of its range class in the
world. In June 2011, Agni-III has been inducted
into the armed forces and is under-production.
Though the first development trial 
of AgniIII carried out on July 9, 2006 could not achieve
the desired result, subsequent tests conducted on
April 12, 2007, May 7, 2008 and February 7, 2010
from the same base were all successful.
<br>
<br>
<b>Agni-IV Missile:</b>
India test-fired nuclear-capable strategic
missile Agni-IV with a strike range of about 4000
km from a test range off Odisha coast. Agni-IV
missile is one of its kind and represents a
quantum leap in terms of missile technology. The
missile is lighter in weight and has two stages of
solid propulsion and a payload with re-entry
heat shield. The missile, is undergoing
developmental trials by country•fs premier
Defence Research and Development
Organisation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Agni-V Missile:</b>
India successfully test-fired Agni-V missile,
a nuclear-capable missile, with a range of more
than 5,000 km. Agni-V is an intercontinental
ballistic missile developed by the DRDO. 
AgniV missile will be tested twice before end of year
2013 to ensure it is ready for full-scale induction
in the armed forces towards end-2015.
With the launch of Agni-V, India has joined
a small group of countries - up to now only the
nuclear-armed superpowers - with intercontinental range ballistic missiles. The Agni-V
is capable of delivering a single 1.5-ton warhead
deep inside nuclear rival China’s territory. It is
17.5m-tall, solid-fuelled, has three stages and a
launch weight of 50 tons.
<br>
<br>
<b>Agni VI Missile:</b>
DRDO announced the next version of Agni
missile, Agni VI. The new version will be capable
of carrying multiple warheads besides having a
longer range. Agni VI is likely to propel India
into the club of countries having inter-continental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The missile, having a
strike range of 8,000-10,000 km, will also have
the facility of a road launcher. While Agni-V can
carry up to three nuclear warheads, the number
could be double or more than that in case of Agni
VI. It is likely to be a three-stage missile. The trial
may come in mid-2014.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Akash</i></strong></div>
            
<b>Type:</b> Medium range, surface-to-air missile.
<br>
<b>Range:</b> 25 km
<br>
<b>Warhead:</b> Pre-fragmented warhead

<br>
<b>Description:</b> It is totally indigenous missile.
The nodal agency which designed the Akash is
Defence Research and Development Laboratory,
Hyderabad. The weight of Akash is about 700
kg and its length is 5.6 meters. This missile had
better features than its U.S. counterpart ‘Patriot.
It is totally mobile and it can be launched from a
battle tank. The Patriot has thrust only for 12
seconds and then the coasting begins. But Akash
has thrust for 35 seconds.
<br>
<br>
It is a multi-target missile - can target four to
five enemy aircrafts and missiles at a time.
Integrated with the indigenously produced
phased array radar called Rajendra. It is capable
of tracking many targets simultaneously. The
Akash system is comparable to the Patriot system
of the USA. India on May 24, 2012 successfully
test fired its two indigenously-developed 
surfaceto-air •eAkash•f missiles of Air Force version
with a strike range of 25 km from the Integrated
Test Range at Chandipur, Odisha.</li>
        <li>

<b>Type:</b> Third generation, ‘fire and forget, antitank guided missile.
<br>
<b>Range:</b> 4 km
<br>
<b>Warhead:</b> Tandem shaped charges
<br>
<b>Propulsion:</b> Solid propellant motor
<br>
<b>Tested:</b> First time on Nov. 24, 1990
<br>
<b>Description:</b> The missile is being developed
to counter contemporary advances in tank
armour especially the very hard or the reactive
types of armour. The missile is mounted on a
tracked vehicle equipped with Line of Sight
(LOS) radar. The radar detects the target, passes
the information (image coordinates) to the
missile. The missile then aligns its sight with that
of the LOS radar and blasts off.
<br>
<br>
<b>Aerial Version of Nag:</b> DRDO, in
collaboration with HAL has developed an aerial
version of land based anti-tank Nag missile. Nag,
an all weather, fire-and-forget anti-tank missile
is one of the five developed by the DRDO under
the Integrated Guided Missile Development
Programme (IGMDP). The others are Akash,
Trishul, Prithvi, and Agni, Nag which has been
successfully test-fired is the only of its kind
having the range in line of sight-up to four km.
It can cover the 4 km. distance in 20 seconds,
travelling at a speed of 900 km an hour.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Avatar:</i></strong></div>
            
Indian scientists have designed a reusable
space plane called ‘Avatar. This space plane can
launch satellites at extremely low cost. Besides,
it can also take tourists on a ride to space. The
man behind this low profile project is air
commander Raghavan Gopalswami; former
Chairman of Hyderabad based Bharat Dynamics
Limited and a pioneer in liquid propulsion
technology. The project team which designed
this plane included Defence Research
Development Organisation (DRDO) and Cim
Technologies. The unique design of Avatar
enables it to be launched again and again upto
100 times. Besides, it produces its own fuel
during the flight. Judging its popularity,
applications have been filed in patent offices in
the United States, Germany, China and Russia.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trishul</i></strong></div>    
        
<b>Type:</b> Short range, surface-to-air missile
<br>
<b>Range:</b> 300 m to 9 km
<br>
<b>Warhead:</b> A pre-fragmented warhead with
a strike radius of 20m.
<br>
<b>Propulsion:</b> Single, solid composite
propellant
<br>
<b>Tested:</b> The short-range missile, Trishul, was
first tested on 5th June, 1989. The supersonic
surface-to-air missile could hit targets both in the
air and on land within a distance of 300 meters
to 9 km. The solid fuel propelled Trishul has a
capacity to carry 15 kg of warhead and has been
developed to cater to the needs of all the three
defence services. The three meter long missile,
having a diameter of 200 cm, is part of the
country’s Integrated Guided Missile
Development Programme.
<br>
<b>Description:</b> It is being developed for all the
three services. The IAF will use it against low
flying aircraft while the Navy will use a modified
version against sea-skimming missiles like the
American Harpoon. The moment the enemy
aircraft is within range, the missile will be
launched, maneuvered into the line of the
tracking beam and guided all the way to the
target. The Air Force version will be simple
except that the version designed for the Navy
will contain an accurate altimeter in its sensor
unit which will enable the missile to skim above
the waves and intercept enemy missiles. The
Trishul has high manoeuvrability and is
powered by a two-stage solid propellant system,
with a highly powered HTBP-type propellant
similar to the ones used in the Patriot.</li>

India on December 21, 2012 successfully test
fired its indigenously developed Astra air-to-air
interceptor missile from a defence base in
Odisha. The beyond-visual-range missile was
tested from the Integrated Test Range (ITR) at
Chandipur, Odisha.
<br>
<br>
The Astra missile uses a terminal active
radar-seeker to find targets and a mid-course
internal guidance system with updates, to track
targets. The on-board ECCM capability allows
it to jam radar signals from an enemy 
surfaceto-air battery, ensuring that the missile is not
tracked or shot down. This indigenous missile is
intended to have performance characteristics
similar to the R-77RVV-AE (AA-12), which
currently forms part of the IAF•fs missile
armoury. The missile is 3.8 metres long and is
said to be configured like a longer version of the
Super 530D, narrower in front of the wings.
Astra uses a HTPB solid-fuel propellant and a
15 kg HE (high-explosive) warhead, activated
by a proximity fuse. The missile has a maximum
speed of Mach 4+ and a maximum altitude of
20 km.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Light Combat Aircraft</i></strong></div>
        
The Government of India in 1984 decided to
establish the Aeronautical Development Agency
(ADA) to manage the Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA) programme. Hindustan Aeronautics
Limited (HAL) was the principal partner with
participation of various DRDO & CSIR
Laboratories.
<br>
<br>
On 22nd January 2009 Light Combat
Aircraft Tejas completed 1000 flights. On 29th
April, 2012, the Naval version of the Light
Combat Aircraft Tejas, made its maiden flight
from the HAL airport in Bangalore. This was a
significant milestone in the history of Indian
Aviation in designing a naval variant of a fighter
aircraft. On 22nd February, 2013, the LCA took
part in the Iron Fist Exercise in Pokhran,
Jaisalmer and on 31st March, 2013, the Tejas
Light Combat Aircraft, LSP-8 accomplished its
maiden flight from HAL airport.
LSP 8: After having received the Flight

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Brahmos Missile</i></strong></div>

It is a cruise missile, jointly developed by
India and Russia under an agreement signed in
1998. It has a range of 290 km and can deliver
payload of 300 kg over 3 times the speed of
sound. It can effectively engage targets from an
altitude as low as 10 metres and has a top speed
of Mach 2.8, which is about three times faster
than the US-made subsonic Tomahawk cruise
missile.
<br>
<br>
The name Brahmos has been derived from
Brahmaputra and Moskva river of Russia. The
company has established with an authorized
capital of $250 million with 50.5 per cent from
Indian side and 49.5 per cent from Russian side.
BrahMos Aerospace was formed as a joint
venture between DRDO and Military Industrial
Consortium NPO Mashinostroeyenia of Russia.
The missile can be installed on ships, submarines,
aircraft and ground vehicles. BrahMos missiles
are inducted in to the armed forces of India and
Russia and can also be exported to friendly
nations.
Sea and ground-launched versions have
been successfully tested and put into service with
the Indian Army and Navy. The flight tests of
the airborne version will be completed by the end
of 2012.
<br>
<br>
<b>Propulsion:</b> BrahMos is powered by a 
twostage propulsion system. Initial acceleration is
provided by a solid-propellant booster and
supersonic cruise speed is provided by a 
liquidfuelled ramjet system. The air-breathing ramjet
propulsion is more fuel-efficient in comparison
with conventional rocket propulsion. It provides
the BrahMos with a longer range over similar
missiles powered by rocket propulsion.
Two advantages of missile:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>It is highly accurate and can be guided
to the target with the help of on-board
computers.</li>
        <li>It travels at supersonic speed in a seaskimming profile.
Supersonic BrahMos</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

India on May 21, 2013 successfully test-fired
the 290-km range BrahMos supersonic cruise
missile from the Navy’s latest guided missile
frigate INS Tarkash off the Goa coast. The missile
performed the high-level ‘C’ manoeuvre in the
pre-determined flight path and successfully hit
the target. The launch was carried out by the
Navy as part of Acceptance Test Firing (ATF) of
the ship. The vertical launch configuration of the
supersonic missile enhances the stealth
capabilities of the ship as the missiles are under
the deck and not exposed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Brahmos-II</i></strong></div>

A hypersonic version of the missile namely
BrahMos-II is also presently under development
with speed of Mach 5 to Mach 7 to boost aerial
fast strike capability. It is expected to be ready
for testing by 2017. During the cruise stage of
flight the missile will be propelled by a scramjet
airbreathing jet engine.
<br>
<br>
<b>Stealth Technology:</b> It is a technology that
makes an aircraft invisible or less visible to the
radars. It involves superior design of aircraft and
use of advanced materials that makes the surface
of aircraft less reflective and absorbs the
electromagnetic waves produced by Radar.
<br>
<b>Indigenous Air Defence System:</b> An
indigenous DRDO-developed air defence system
with a centralized command, control and
communication structure and linked to several
mission (control) units throughout the country
to detect all incoming missile and enemy aircraft.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>‘Silent’ Radar</i></strong></div>

India has developed low-probability
intercept radar that cannot be detected by an
incoming aircraft and can escape from an antiradiation missile attack. The radar for naval
applications has been developed by Bharat
Electronics Limited (BEL).
This is different in the sense that a normal
radar sends out a warning to incoming air craft
that is being tracked. “The low probability
intercept radar developed by BEL does the
radiation in a special way at a very low level of
power.” Dubbed as “Silent radar”, it can be
saved from anti-radiation missile attack by the
aircraft since it cannot be detected by the aircraft.
The main features of the new radar are: nil
personal hazard, high resolution, fully solid state
and low power consumption.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUPERSONIC INTERCEPTOR
MISSILE OF INDIA</i></strong></div>

India rides new high with successfully
conducting a test of new supersonic interceptor
missile off the Orissa coast, on 22nd November,
2012. India successfully test-fired an
indigenously developed supersonic interceptor
missile, capable of destroying a hostile ballistic
missile, from a test range off the Odisha coast.
India is working towards development of a multilayer Ballistic Missile Defence system. The 'hostile'
ballistic missile, a modified surface- to-surface
'Prithvi', mimicking an incoming enemy weapon,
first lifted off from a mobile launcher from the
launch complex-3 of integrated test range (ITR)
at Chandipur-on-Sea, about 15 km from
Balasore.
<br>
<br>
Within about four minutes, the interceptor,
Advanced Air Defence (AAD) missile positioned
at Wheeler Island, about 70 km from Chandipur,
after getting signals from tracking radars, roared
through its trajectory to destroy the incoming
missile mid-air, in an "endo-atmospheric"
altitude. The interceptor is a 7.5-metre-long
single-stage solid rocket propelled guided missile
equipped with a navigation system, a hi-tech
computer and an electro-mechanical activator.
The interceptor missile had its own mobile
launcher, secure data link for interception,
independent tracking and homing capabilities,
besides sophisticated radars.
The system is in fact slightly better than
Patriot Advanced Capability - (PAC-3) of the US
in terms of interception, altitude and range
against incoming ballistic missiles. The aim and
objective of the exercise was to test the missile’s
ability to provide an air-shield (cover) to
important Indian metros against hostile attacks.
Besides, the missile would be moved closer to the
Indio-Pak and Sino-Indian borders during crisis
or wartime.
<br>
<br>
Missile Technology Control Regime
The MTCR (Missile Technology Control
Regime) grew out of arrangements entered into
in the East-West conventional arms talks of the
1970s. It became a formal but non-treaty
arrangement in 1987 and currently has about
34 members/adherents. Its purpose is to control
the technology and export of items that could
be used to produce a missile capable of carrying
a nuclear warhead. MTCR guidelines apply to
missiles with ranges longer than 300 km. and
payloads greater than 500 kg. The guidelines
incorporate a list of items to be controlled.
However, national export decisions are not
subject to group review or sanctions. Export of
munitions items are denied to non-members with
appropriate assurances from the government of
the importing country. The MTCR originally
formulated by the G-7 nations for restricting
transfer of critical technology classified as
category I (greatest sensitivity) and category II
(least sensitivity). The cryogenic engine
technology falls under category I of the MTCR
list of controlled technologies and the transfer
therefore goes against what the guidelines seek
to prevent and ‘curb’, in the language of MTCR
guidelines, “the dangerous proliferation of
missile technology by non-members”. India is
neither member nor adherent of the MTCR.

        <li><div class="subheading"><strong><i>INS Chakra:</i></strong></div>
        With the induction of Nerpa, rechristened
INS Chakra, into the Indian Navy in April 2012,
India is back in the elite club of nations having
nuclear-powered submarines. INS Chakra is a
Russia-made, nuclear-propelled, hunter-killer
submarine. The Akula Class submarine will
carry conventional weapons. The vessel is armed
with four 533 mm torpedo tubes and four
650mm torpedo tubes. It will be used to hunt
and kill enemy ships. The INS Chakra displaces
about 10,000 tons. It can do over 30 knots - more
than twice the speed of conventional submarines.
It can go upto a depth of 600 metres. It is one of
the quietest nuclear submarines around, with
noise levels next to zero.
<br>
<br>
INS Chakra has been taken on lease from
Russia for 10 years and would provide the Navy
the opportunity to train personnel and operate
such nuclear-powered vessels. In 2004, India had
signed a deal with Russia worth over $900 million
for leasing the submarine. The only other nations
possessing nuclear-powered submarines are -
US, Russia, UK, France and China. India is back
in this elite club after over a decade.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>INS Arihant:</i></strong></div>
            
India reached a milestone with the launch
of the country’s first nuclear submarine, INS
Arihant at Visakhapatnam. Code-named
Advanced Technology Vessel (ATV), the
submarine was launched for sea trials at the
Matsya naval dockyard in Vishakhapatnam.
With the launch, India joined the exclusive club
of US, Russia, China, France and the UK with
similar capabilities. Symbolically the Arihant was
launched on 26th July 2009, the anniversary of
Vijay Diwas (Kargil War Victory Day).
As India has declared “no first use” of
nuclear weapons, the country’s weapons system
must survive a first strike for retaliation.
Therefore, Arihant’s primary weapon is stealth
as it can lurk in ocean depths of half a kilometre
or more and fire its missiles from under the sea.
The induction of ATV will help India to complete
the nuclear weapons triad, as envisaged under
its nuclear doctrine to deliver nuke-tipped
missiles from land, air and sea.
Key facts</li>
        <li>The Rs. 30,000-crore secret nuclear
submarine project was started in the

its ammunition for use in the mountainous
regions, 105 mm Indian field Gun, unguided
rockets for air to ground use. Currently ARDE
is actively engaged in the development of a Fin
Stabilized Armour piercing Discarding Sabot, a
family of small arms with matching ammunition,
a powerful gun for the Main Battle Tank, rapid
fire multi barrel rocket system and several more
weapons. A special explosive bore-hole charge
developed by ARDE has been utilized by the Oil
and Natural Gas Commission in petroleum
exploration. Armament design is a
multidisciplinary effort and for this purposes
ARDE maintains a continuous interaction with
other defence establishments.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BIOLOGICAL AND
CHEMICAL WEAPONS</i></strong></div>

Like a nuclear bomb, a chemical or biological
weapon is a weapon of mass destruction. An
effective attack using a chemical or biological
agent can easily kill thousands of people.
Biological warfare (BW) — also known as
germ warfare — is the deliberate use of diseasecausing biological agents such as bacteria,
viruses, fungi, or biological toxins, to kill or
incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act
of war. Biological weapons are living organisms
or replicating entities (viruses) that reproduce or
replicate within their host victims.
Offensive biological warfare, including mass
production, stockpiling and use of biological
weapons, was outlawed by the 1972 Biological
Weapons Convention (BWC). The rationale
behind this treaty, which has been ratified or
acceded to by 170 countries as of April 2013, is
to prevent a biological attack which could
conceivably result in large numbers of civilian
fatalities and cause severe disruption to economic
and societal infrastructure. Many countries,
including signatories of the BWC, currently
pursue research into the defense or protection
against BW, which is not prohibited by the BWC.
In 1972, the United States signed the
Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention,
which banned the “development, production
and stockpiling of microbes or their poisonous
products except in amounts necessary for
protective and peaceful research.”
A chemical weapon is any weapon that uses
a manufactured chemical to kill people. The first
chemical weapon used effectively in battle was
chlorine gas, which burns and destroys lung
tissue.

Modern chemical weapons tend to focus on
agents with much greater killing power,
meaning that it takes a lot less of the chemical to
kill the same number of people. Many of them
use the sorts of chemicals found in insecticides.
The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
is an arms control agreement which outlaws the
production, stockpiling and use of chemical
weapons. Its full name is the Convention on the
Prohibition of the Development, Production,
Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and
on their Destruction. The main obligation under
the convention is the prohibition of use and
production of chemical weapons, as well as the
destruction of all chemical weapons.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>IAF’S VISION 2020</i></strong></div>

The Indian Air Force (IAF) in its recently held
presentation entitled ‘Vision 2020’ made several
suggestions of strategic importance to the
Government. Primarily it suggested the
formation of a nuclear air command even as it
seeks two front capability and enhanced force
levels in the years to come. The presentation was
path-breaking since it advocated that the
country’s strategic resources be placed under the
nuclear air command because only the IAF had
the required delivery platforms-meaning the
strategic reach aircraft. According to the IAF,
the Army did not need and in fact might not
need a nuclear role because of the incongruity
of tactical nuclear weapons in India’s draft
nuclear doctrine. The third leg of the triad;
nuclear submarine was still beyond the Indian
Navy’s reach. The vision document
recommended that as soon as the ‘Agni’
