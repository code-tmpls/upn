<h3>Energy Resources</h3>

Energy is one of the most important building
block in human development, and, as such, acts
as a key factor in determining the economic
development of all countries. In an effort to meet
the demands of a developing nation, the Indian
energy sector has witnessed a rapid growth.
Areas like the resource exploration and
exploitation, capacity additions, and energy
sector reforms have been revolutionized.
However, resource augmentation and growth
in energy supply have failed to meet the ever
increasing demands exerted by the multiplying
population, rapid urbanization and progressing
economy. Hence, serious energy shortages
continue to plague India, forcing it to rely heavily
on imports.
<br>
<br>
India is the fourth largest consumer of
energy in the world after USA, China and Russia
but it is not endowed with abundant energy
resources. It must, therefore, meet its
development needs by using all available
domestic resources of coal, uranium, oil, hydro
and other renewable resources, and
supplementing domestic production by imports.
High reliance on imported energy is costly
given the prevailing energy prices which are not
likely to soften; it also impinges adversely on
energy security. Meeting the energy needs of
achieving 8 per cent 9 per cent economic growth
while also meeting energy requirements of the
population at affordable prices therefore
presents a major challenge.
Social, economic and scientific developments
are directly linked to the development of energy
resources. However, the present stock of energy
resources of the world is limited and can last
only for a few decades. Moreover most
conventional energy sources are non-renewable.
Hence, mankind is searching new source of
energy and the development of renewable
sources of energy along with the rational use of
existing non-renewable energy and their
conservation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ENERGY SOURCES IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

Energy resources are classified into
conventional and non conventional forms on the
basis of their use. Conventional or nonrenewable sources are those especially coming
from the fossils and which cannot be re-used once
exhausted like coal, petroleum, wood, etc.
However non-conventional or renewable
sources, as the name suggests are inexhaustible
pool of energy, ready at every moment to be used
or re-used like tidal energy, wind energy,
biomass energy, etc.
Establishment of new generation capacity
and reducing cost of power will require action
on many fronts:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Availability of fuel such as coal or natural
gas for new power plants must be assured;</li>
        <li>A national consensus on royalty rates for
fuels and compensation for host states also
needs to be worked;</li>
        <li>Long term finance should be made
available to lower capital charge;</li>
        <li>The presently provided guaranteed rate of
post tax returns for CPSUs should be
lowered to reduce cost of power and
augment resources of state power utilities;</li>
        <li>An efficient inter-state and intra-state
transmission system of adequate capacity
that is capable of transferring power from
one region to another;</li>
        <li>An efficient distribution system which alone
can ensure financially viable expansion;</li>
        <li>Rehabilitation of thermal stations through
R&M to augment generating capacity and
improve PLF;</li>
        <li>Rehabilitation of hydro stations to yield
additional peaking capacity;</li>
        <li>Ensuring use of washed coal for power
generation;</li>
        <li>Harnessing captive capacity to support the
grid.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Coal & Lignite</i></strong></div>    
        
Coal is the mainstay of India’s energy sector
accounting for over 50 per cent of primary
commercial energy supply in 2010–11. This
share will actually increase to 57 per cent over
the next 10 years. The gap between the demand
and the domestic supply of coal has made it
imperative to augment domestic production both
from the public sector and the private sector and
to expedite the reform process for realising
efficiency gains through increased competition
in the sector during the 12th Plan.
An important feature of the 11th Plan was
the attempt to augment domestic coal
production from captive mines. However, the
programme slipped and expected production
from captive blocks fell well short of the
projected target of 104 million tonnes in the
terminal year of the Plan.
<br>
<br>
The target for coal production at the end of
the 11th Plan was initially set at 680 million
tonnes and revised downwards to 630 million
tones at the time of the MTA. The actual
achievement was only 540 million tonnes. Since
demand in the terminal year (2011–12) of the
11th Plan was around 640 million tonnes there
was a large demand–supply gap of 100 million
tonnes which was only partially met by imports.
This adversely affected the coal supplies to end
consumers, particularly the power sector.
It is estimated that out of capacity addition
of 41,894 MW, around 25,000 MW of coal-based
capacity commissioned is being sub-optimally
utilized because of inadequate availability of
domestic coal. The widening gap between
demand and supply has to be met by imports
because of which the share of imports in the total
coal demand is likely to increase.
As on March 31, 2012 the estimated reserves
of coal was around 293.5 billion tones, an
addition of 7.64 billion over the last year. There
has been an increase of 2.67 per cent in the
estimated coal reserves during the year 2011-12
with Madhya Pradesh accounting for the
maximum increase of 5.41 per cent.
<br>
<br>
Coal deposits are mainly confined to eastern
and south central parts of the country. The states
of Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, West
Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and
Madhya Pradesh account for more than 99% of
the total coal reserves in the country.
The estimated reserve of lignite was 41.96
billion tonnes against 40.91 billion tonnes in
2011. The increase in the estimated reserve of
lignite during the year 2011-12 was 1.22 per cent,
Tamil Nadu accounting for the maximum
increase of 2.99 per cent.
Domestic production of coal and lignite
account for two-third of total production of
commercial energy in 2000–01 and is projected
to be about the same in 2021–22. As a percentage
of total consumption of commercial energy, the
share of coal and lignite was projected to increase
to 57 per cent, from a level of 50 per cent in
2000–01.</li>
        <li>Oil and Gas
Petroleum is derived from dead animals that
lived in remote past. Natural gas has also been
produced in the Earth’s crust by similar processes
and this is also a combustible fuel. The
exploitation of oil on a large scale really started
after 1860, the year when the first commercial
well is reported to have come into existence. With
the discovery of oil and its refined products such
as gasoline and diesel, new engines and
machines came into existence and productivity
increased. Indeed, this was a period of the
industrial revolution. Oil and its derived
products are very convenient and versatile as
fuels and can be easily transported.
In India, efforts made by the Oil and Natural
Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Oil India since the
late 1950s have led to the identification of a
number of oil and gas deposits both offshore and
onshore. The onshore fields were mainly
discovered in the Mumbai, Gujarat, Assam and
Arunachal Pradesh; and the offshore fields in
the sea were notably the Mumbai High fields
such as North and South Basin and South Tapti.
Oil and gas has also been discovered in the
Godavari Basin and on the East Coast.
The new exploration strategy places
emphasis on intensive exploration survey and
drilling in order to add to petroleum reserves and
to augment production as early as possible. In
order to meet burgeoning demand for petroleum
products in the country, the Ministry of
Petroleum & Natural Gas has taken several
measures to enhance exploration and
exploitation of petroleum resources including
natural gas and Coal Bed Methane (CBM), apart
from improved distribution, marketing and
pricing of petroleum products.
<br>
<br>
During the financial year 2011-12, crude oil
production was about 38.09 million metric tonne
(MMT), with share of national oil companies at
72.4 per cent. The projected crude oil production
in 2012-13 was about 41.12 MMT which is about
8 per cent higher than the previous year crude
oil production. The increase in crude oil
production is mainly due to higher crude oil
production from Barmer Fields, Rajasthan.
The average natural gas production in the
year 2011-12 was about 130 million metric
standard cubic metre per day (MMSCMD) which
was about 9 per cent lower than the previous
year mainly due to lower production from KG
D6 deepwater block. The projected natural gas
production in 2012-13 is about 118.3 MMSCMD,
which was about 9 per cent lower than the
previous year.
<br>
<br>
The Indian refinery capacity as on August
1, 2012 was 215.08 MMT which was expected
to reach to 218.40 MMT by the end of 2012-13.
Refinery production (crude throughput) during
2011-12 was 211.42 MMT (including crude
throughput by RIL SEZ Refinery). At present,
there are 22 refineries (17 under Public Sector, 3
under private sector and 2 in joint venture) in
India.
Natural gas is emerging as an important
source in India’s commercial energy scene in
view of large reserves of gas that have been
established in the country, particularly, in South
Basin off West Coast of India. Natural gas is also
making significant contribution to the household
sector by way of LPG extracted from associated
gas. About 30 per cent of the country’s output
of LPG comes from this source.
The Dabhol-Bengaluru gas pipeline was
commissioned by GAIL on February 18, 2013.
The 1,000 kms pipeline, built at a cost of Rs. 4,500
crore, will carry gas from Dabhol LNG terminal
into Bengaluru and feed industries in Belgaum,
Dharwad, Gadag, Bellary, Davangere,
Chitradurg, Tumkur, Ramanagram and
Bengaluru.
<br>
<br>
India is highly dependent on import of crude
oil. Both gross and net imports of crude oil have
increased from 11.68 MTs during 1970-71 to
171.73 MTs during 2011-12. There has been an
annual increase of 4.97 per cent during 2011-12
over 2010-11, as the net import increased from
163.60 MTs to 171.73 MTs. Although more than
70% of its crude oil requirements and part of the
petroleum products is met from imports, India
has developed sufficient processing capacity over
the years to produce different petroleum
products so as to become a net exporter of
petroleum products. The import of petroleum
products increased from only 1.08 MT in 1970-
71 to 15.00 MT during 2011-12. However, there
was a decline of 10.82% in import of petroleum
products over the previous year.
Share of oil in total commercial energy
consumption is expected to decline from 37.5 per
cent in 2000–01 to 23.3 per cent in 2021–22, the
share of natural gas and liquefied natural gas
(LNG) is projected to rise from 8.5 per cent to 13
per cent in the same period. The combined share
of oil and natural gas in energy consumption
was 24.7 per cent in 2011–12 and is expected to
be about the same in 2021–22.
<br>
<br>
The estimated reserves of crude oil in India
as on March 31, 2012 stood at 759.59 million
tonnes (MT). Geographical distribution of Crude
oil indicates that the maximum reserves are in
the Western Offshore (44.46%) followed by
Assam (22.71%), whereas the maximum reserves
of Natural Gas are in the Eastern Offshore
(34.73%) followed by Western offshore (31.62%).
There was an increase of 0.29 per cent in the
estimated reserve of crude oil for the country as
a whole during 2011-12. There was an increase
of estimated Crude Oil reserves by 7.09 per cent
in Andhra Pradesh followed by Tamil Nadu
(4.48%).
<br>
<br>
The estimated reserves of natural gas in India
as on March 31, 2012 stood at 1330.26 billion
cubic meters (BCM). In case of Natural Gas, the
increase in the estimated reserves over the last
year was 4.08 per cent. The maximum
contribution to this increase has been from Cold
Bed Methane (11.32%), followed by Tripura
(8.95%).</li>
        <li>Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production
During the year 2011-12, production for
crude oil was 38.09 MMT, which is about 1.08%
higher than the actual crude oil production of
37.684 MMT during 2010-11. Natural gas
production during 2011-12 was 47.559 BCM
against production of 52.219 BCM during 2010-
11 which is lower by 8.92 per cent due to lower
production from KG D-6 basin.
<br>
<br>
The Government of India launched the ninth
bid round of New Exploration Licensing Policy
(NELPIX) and fourth round of Coal Bed Methane
Policy (CBM-IV) during October 2010 to enhance
the Country’s energy security. In addition, in
order to supplement domestic reserves the oil and
gas PSUs have acquired assets abroad, the
production of oil and natural gas of ONGCVIDESH Ltd during 2011-12 was 8.75 MMT of
oil and equivalent gas (MMTOE) from its assets
abroad.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Hydrogen-CNG Fuel Centre</i></strong></div>    
        
The Renewable Energy Ministry on 7th
June,2007 unveiled a Rs 25,000 crore roadmap
to promote use of hydrogen, with an estimated
one million vehicles using it as fuel by 2020 and
the gas being used to fire electricity generation
units for an aggregate 1,000 mw of electricity.
As part of the new initiative, a demonstration
project for setting up a hydrogen dispensing setup at a petrol pump in Delhi has been
sanctioned as a joint venture with Indian Oil
Corporation. The project would enable
dispensing of neat hydrogen and CNG blended
with hydrogen as fuel for vehicles. The station
will have a hydrogen generation capacity using
an electrolyser system and facilities for storing
and dispensing neat hydrogen as well as blended
with CNG in varying ratios. The H-CNG blends
will be used in the modified CNG vehicles and
are expected to further reduce emissions from
such vehicles as compared to when burning only
CNG. The project would also generate
operational experience in handling hydrogen as
an automotive fuel.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NON-CONVENTIONAL
SOURCES OF ENERGY</i></strong></div>

In the long run, new and renewable sources
of energy will be necessary since the reserves of
conventional fuels, such as, oil and coal are
limited in the world and the pressure on their
availability and prices will steadily mount as
demands increase. Even in India, at the current
level of production, coal is expected to last for
only 245 years, oil for 21 years and natural gas
for another 38 years. Such alternate sources of
energy are renewable by nature and have also
the advantage of generally producing energy in
a non-polluting form. Thus, the twin objectives
of energy production and environmental
preservation can both be largely met by recourse
to these renewable forms of energy.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Solar Energy</i></strong></div>
            
The Sun provides us enormous amounts of
energy in the form of solar radiation-energy that
travels in small wave packets called photons,
reaching the surface of the Earth from a distance
of 93 million miles. Radiation energy is released
due to thermo-nuclear fusion going on
continuously in the Sun. The solar energy
reaching per square metre of the Earth’s
atmosphere is called the ‘Solar Constant’ and is
equal to 1.36 KW in 12 hours. The total energy
being received by the atmosphere is about
1.5x1018 KWh per day. It is believed that with
just 0.1% of the 75000 trillion KWh of solar
energy that reaches the Earth, the energy
required by plants can be satisfied. Application
of solar energy can broadly be sub-divided as
follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Conversion of solar energy into heat.</li>
        <li>Conversion of solar energy directly into
electricity.</li>
        <li>Conversion of solar energy to plants,
vegetable or other biological forms and
application of solar energy to convert these
forms into usable forms of fuel. This may
broadly be termed as bio-energy.</li>
        <li>Indirect application of solar energy, such
as, harnessing of winds, waves,
temperature gradients from the ocean, etc.
All of which are the consequences of
incident solar energy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Applications</i></strong></div>

Solar Cooker: Depending upon the type of
cooker, the temperature in the range of 120° to
300°C can be attained. This can save 30-50% of
commonly used cooking fuels like wood, coal,
LPG, Kerosene, etc. The drawback with such
cooker is that the cooker has to be directed
towards the Sun after every 10-15 minutes and
if the automatic devices for such tracking are
provided, the cost increases. In 1982, India
became the first country in the world to start
regular large scale commercial production and
marketing of solar cookers.
<br>
Solar Pond: Solar pond is one of the most
promising technologies in solar energy utilization
for varied purposes. It’s a large-scale solar energy
collector with integral heat energy storage by
various ways, such as, process heating, water
desalination, refrigeration and drying.
Fluids such as water and air become lighter
and rise above when heated. Similarly, when
water is heated by the Sun’s rays, hot water from
the bottom of the pond rises and it reaches the
surface, and loses whatever heat it has gained
to the atmosphere. The result is that the pond
water remains at nearly atmospheric
temperature. To prevent this heat loss by
convection in a solar pond, salt is dissolved in
the bottom layer of the pond. This makes the
water too heavy (i.e. dense) to rise even when
hot, to the surface, and cool. Thus, the solar
energy remains entrapped in the pond.
<br>
<br>
A solar pond consists of three zones — The
top zone or the surface zone is at atmospheric
temperature and has little salt content. The
bottom zone is very hot (100°C) and very salty
with specific gravity of about 1.20. It is this zone
which collects and stores the solar energy in the
form of heat and is, hence, known as storage
zone. Separating these two zones is the gradient
zone that acts as a transparent insulator,
permitting sunlight to reach the bottom zone and
its thermal energy to remain entrapped there.
The useful energy is then withdrawn from the
solar pond in the form of hot brine from the
storage zone.
Solar ponds have three major advantages over
the other solar technologies:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>they have a low cost per unit area.</li>
        <li>they can be constructed over large areas
enabling the diffused solar radiation to
be concentrated on large scale;</li>
        <li>they can supply energy even during the
monsoon season.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
India is the first Asian country to have a solar
pond (6000 sq. metres) in Bhuj, Gujarat. The
project was sanctioned under the National Solar
Pond Programme by the Ministry of Nonconventional Energy Sources in 1987 and
completed in 1993. The Bhuj solar pond has been
designed to supply about 220 lakh KWH of
thermal energy per annum; about 1,25,000 KWH
of electricity per annum; and about 80,000 litres
of potable water per day.
<br>
Solar Water Heaters: This system consists
of Flat-plate solar collector and storage tank. This
system has many applications in the domestic
and industrial sectors. It can provide hot water
for different applications such as in textile
engineering, directly or as boiler feed and in the
hotels and canteens, apart from domestic sector.
Today, such water heaters are being
manufactured by many industrial
manufacturers in India and abroad.
<br>
Solar Desalination: It works on the water
heating principle. It can be used to provide water
for drinking in areas where only salty or brackish
water is available. It can also be used to provide
distilled water needed for batteries and other
applications. About 3 to 4 litres of pure water
can be obtained from one square metre area of
the system per day.
<br>
Solar Air Heaters: It can be used for various
applications like drying of Foodgrains,
vegetables, fruits, wood, etc. Products dried in a
solar dryer are as good, if not better, in quality
and food value as compared to those dried in
conventional dryers. Temperature as high as
130°C can very easily be attained with this simple
system. This hot air can be utilised to dry any
material, such as, wood or agricultural crops,
increasing the speed and efficiency of such drying
several times more than the traditional method
of direct exposure to the Sun. The heated air can
also be used to operate engines.
<br>
Solar Space Conditioning: A number of
solar houses have been built in different
countries of the world with heating systems
comprising of flat-plate collectors and storage
units, proper heat distribution and control
system. Such systems are normally based on
absorption refrigeration cycle. However, the
cooling of residential and office buildings can
also be done by following the solar cooling
process.
<br>
Solar Refrigeration: Utilization of solar
energy for production of low temperature has
been found to be an attractive proposition
because the cooling effect is most needed when
the Sun is shining. Solar cooling is a most required
application for developing countries where
considerable quantity of food produce are
spoiled due to inadequate and improper
processing and lack of storage facilities.
<br>
Solar Stem Generators: This is done by
concentrating the solar radiation using
concentrating collectors like parabolic line
focusing systems, parabolic point focusing
systems or plane reflector central tower systems.
Temperature as high as 3000°C can be achieved.
The steam can be utilised in industry to operate
engines, or to generate power.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Wind Energy</i></strong></div>    
        
Wind energy is the kinetic energy associated
with movement of large masses of air resulting
from the differential heating of the atmosphere
by the Sun. Hence, wind energy is nothing but
the converted form of solar energy. It is estimated
that about 106 to 107 MW of usable power is
continuously available in the Earth’s winds.
Though the total quantity of this resource is
extremely large, it is concentrated in certain
regions, and can vary a great deal with time at
given location. For the utilization of wind energy,
the speed of wind must be between 8 to 22 m
per second. Wind energy is renewable and
possess no major environmental threats.
A total capacity of 18,420 MW has been
established up to December 2012 in the country.
India is now the fifth largest wind power
producer in the world, after China, USA,
Germany and Spain. As per Indian Wind Atlas,
the on-shore wind power potential has been
estimated as 49,130 MW at 50 m height.
<br>
<br>
Wind Energy Conversion: The shaft power
from the wind turbine can be utilized for a wide
variety of purposes, including electricity (AC &
DC generation), direct pumping, direct
mechanical work, etc. The most common wind
turbine system involves a tower mounted multibladed rotor facing into the wind, rotating
around a horizontal axis and turning an electrical
generator or a mechanical gearbox connected to
its axis. The maximum power that can be
extracted from a wind turbine is 59.3 per cent.
<br>
Water Pumping Windmills: Small windmills
with direct mechanical drive matched to a pump
and tank storage are in extensive use in many
parts of the world. These hold significant
potential for pumping water irrigation, drinking
needs, etc. Improved types of soil water pumping
windmills have also been developed in several
countries, including India.
<br>
Wind Electric Conversion Systems: Wind
energy is a high-quality form of mechanical
energy that can be converted into electrical
energy with minimal energy losses. Since the
rotor of a windmill moves periodically, the output
may be obtained in the form of alternating
current either by using a gearbox or fixing the
rotational speed or by allowing speed variations
and transforming the generated electrical power
to the desired frequency, electronically.
Application ranges from small scale use in rural
and remote communities interconnected with
other power plants to large scale generation of
electricity, which is fed into electric utility
network. It can also be used for battery charging
by driving brushless DC generators, to supply
electric power to isolated communities, weather
stations, navigation and communication aids,
etc. A number of countries like Denmark,
Sweden and USA have launched major wind
energy testing programmes in an effort to
integrate large scale wind-generated electric
power into grid power supply. The combination
of wind power system and hydroelectric system
is considered to have high potential. Stored
water can be used in low wind periods.
Favourable wind regimes on islands, coastal
areas and mountain regions could be taken
advantage of in setting up large numbers of wind
turbines.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tapping wind power</i></strong></div>

The Union Ministry of Non-conventional
Energy Sources (MNES) has recently assessed
that the potential of the wind power sector in
India is 45,000 MW, which is more than twice
the earlier estimates (i.e., 20,000 MW). Thus,
India’s potential for using wind power is much
more than was previously thought. Presently,
India occupies the fifth position in the world with
a wind power installed capacity of 18.4 GW.
During the year 2012-13 1,067 MW wind power
projects were commissioned.
<br>
<br>
In order to generate greater wind power, the
domestic wind power-generating sector has to
be more professional. It must not be bogged
down by constraints like weak grids, inadequate
data on winds and incompatibility with
imported infrastructure. 14 States, based on the
guidelines of MNES, have introduced policies,
which entail banking facility, third party sales
of power, etc. MNES is in the process of
preparing a ‘master plan’ for wind power in 10
States, for 80 potential sites. There is no denying
the fact that without imaginative use of wind
power, the energy crunch could not be tackled.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ocean Energy</i></strong></div>    
        
The sea, which is constantly receiving solar
radiations and acts as the world’s largest natural
solar collector, has potential to provide a means
of utilizing renewable energy. It acts not only as
collector, but also has an enormous storage
capacity. Energy from the ocean is available in
several forms such as ocean thermal energy,
wave energy, tidal energy, salinity gradients,
ocean currents, ocean winds and bio-mass.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion</i></strong></div>    

There exists a temperature difference of the
order of 20°C between the warm surface water
of the sea and the cold deep water, and this
natural temperature difference can be used to
generate energy. In one OTEC plant, the warm
water from the surface with the temperature of
24 to 30°C is brought into one pipe and the cold
water at the temperature of about 4 to 8°C is
brought in another pipe in the depth of about
1000 metres. These two pipes are used in
conjunction with fluid such as ammonia,
propane or neon. The warm water evaporates
liquid ammonia into vapour at high pressure and
is made to pass through a turbine which rotates
it and generates electricity. The ammonia vapour
coming out of the turbine is condensed back into
liquid ammonia by cooling it with the cold sea
water brought up from the deep part. The
liquified ammonia is then pumped back to the
evaporator, thus, completing the cycle, which
can then run continuously.
<br>
<br>
Energy from OTEC can be converted into
either electrical, chemical or protein form. These
plants could be combined with energy intensive
industries like ammonia, hydrogen or aluminium
production. Furthermore, OTEC plants can be
combined with aquaculture or desalination for
obtaining fresh water. The cold water from the
deeper sea which is rich in nutrients can be
placed in a lagoon or lake where these nutrients
can help to raise fish, oysters or other types of
biological life.
Being a tropical country, India has the OTEC
potential of about 50,000 MW. The most
promising site identified so far is on the
Lakshadweep Islands where the necessary
geographical conditions for a shore-based OTEC
plant exist. In these islands, the alternative cost
of producing electricity by transporting diesel
from the main land as is being done at present,
is very high. India has also tied up with a USfirm to set up an OTEC Plant in Tamil Nadu.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Wave Energy</i></strong></div>

Movement of large quantities of water up
and down can, in principle, be harnessed to
convert it into usable form of energy, such as,
electricity or mechanical power. Several types
based on flats, flaps, ramps and oscillating air
water columns have been worked upon to
harness wave energy. It is more reliable than the
wind energy because here the fluctuation is less
than the wind. However at present, due to infant
stage of its technology, the cost per unit of energy
converted is high because of the need for special
structures at sea, corrosion problem associated
with the use of sea water and the problem of
transmitting the power onshore.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tidal Energy</i></strong></div>

Tides are created by the combined
gravitational effect of the Earth, the Moon and
the Sun. Though the tide is the universal
phenomenon of the Earth’s sea-water body,
some regions are more favourable for the
establishment of such power plant for the
commercial production of tidal energy. Primary
requirements for the construction of an
installation having a capacity over 200 MW are
(i) an average tide of 5-12 metres; (ii) the
possibility of linkage to a grid in order to
accommodate the variable power output of the
tidal plant; (iii) favourable geographical location
and favourable socio-economic and ecological
conditions. Bulb type turbines as used in
conventional hydro-electric stations have proved
to be reliable for generating power from the tides.
In India, three potential sites have so far been
identified, namely, the Gulfs of Kutch and
Cambay on the west coast in Gujarat and the
Sunderbans along the east coast in West Bengal.
According to the estimates of the Indian
government, the country has a potential of 8,000
MW of tidal energy. This includes about 7,000
MW in the Gulf of Cambay in Gujarat, 1,200
MW in the Gulf of Kutch and 100 MW in the
Gangetic delta in the Sunderbans region of West
Bengal. ‘Central Electricity Authority’ in India
has the overall responsibility for developing it.
A power plant of 600 MW capacity is proposed
to be set up in the Gulf of Kutch.
The Gujarat government is all set to develop
India’s first tidal energy plant. In 2012, the state
government had approved Rs. 25 crore for
setting up the 50 MW plant at the Gulf of Kutch.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>HYDRO ENERGY</i></strong></div>
            
India is blessed with immense amount of
hydro-electric potential and ranks 5th in terms
of exploitable hydro-potential on global scenario.
As per assessment made by CEA, India is
endowed with economically exploitable hydropower potential to the tune of 1,48,700 MW of
installed capacity. Today, about 23 per cent of
the total electric power in the world comes from
hydropower.
<br>
<br>
India is endowed with economically
exploitable and viable hydro potential assessed
to be about 84,000 MW at 60 per cent load factor
(1,48,701 MW installed capacity). In addition,
6780 MW in terms of installed capacity from
Small, Mini, and Micro Hydel schemes have been
assessed. Also, 56 sites for pumped storage
schemes with an aggregate installed capacity of
94,000 MW have been identified. However, only
19.9 per cent of the potential has been harnessed
so far.
<br>
<br>
The total hydro-electric potential in India has
been estimated at about 472x109 kilowatt hours
or 472 terawatt hours normally. But, we have
exploited only a little more than 19 per cent of
the total potential. In addition, it is also estimated
that an annual energy generation of about 25
terawatt could be obtained economically
through mini and micro-hydels, coal drops and
other possible low- head developments. A centre
for the development and demonstration of
alternate small hydro technologies has been set
up at Roorkee University by the Department of
Non-Conventional Energy Sources for
development of newer and more economic
designs of micro-hydel units, water mills and
hydrams. Several field projects in Haryana,
Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Jammu
and Kashmir are being initiated to utilise the
potential availability of canal drops, falls, runoff-river systems, etc.
The National Hydro-Electric Power
Corporation (NHPC) was incorporated in 1975
with the objectives to plan, promote and organise
the integrated development of hydro-electric
power. NHPC Limited presently has an
installation base of 5295 MW from 14
hydropower stations on ownership basis,
including projects taken up in Joint Venture.
Some important hydro-electric power projects
constructed by NHPC are at Salal and Dulhasti
(both in J&K), Tanakpur (Uttarakhand),
Chamera (HP), Baira Siul (HP), Chutak (J&K),
Teesta Low Dam – III (W.Bengal), Sewa - II
(J&K), Teesta - V (Sikkim), Omkareshwar (MP),
Dhauliganga - I (Uttarakhand), Indira Sagar
(MP), Rangit (Sikkim), Uri - I (J&K), and Loktak
(Manipur).
<br>
<br>
NHPC Limited is presently engaged in the
construction of 10 projects aggregating to a total
installed capacity of 4502 MW. Given the
renewed thrust on development of hydro power
in the country, NHPC Limited has drawn up a
massive plan to add over 10,000 MW of
hydropower capacity by the end of XIIth Plan
(year 2017).
<br>
<br>
The National Projects Construction
Corporation (NPCC) was set up in 1957 as a
joint venture of central and state governments
as a construction-contracting agency for the
execution of multipurpose river valley projects,
power projects and other heavy engineering
projects. As a part of diversification plan, the
Corporation proposes to take up the work of
transmission lines also.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>GEOTHERMAL ENERGY</i></strong></div>    
        
Geothermal energy is the exploitation of heat
energy of Earth within 10 km of the Earth’s
upper crust. Geothermal energy can be
processed for generation of power, where the
geothermal fluid has a temperature of 130°C.
Geothermal manifestations are widespread in
India in the form of 340 Hot Springs localities.
Only a few direct utilization schemes have been
launched by various agencies. They are in Puga,
Chhumuthang, Manikaran and Bakreshwar. Of
these, India’s most promising geothermal field
is in Puga valley in Ladakh. There are number
of geothermal wells drilled in the valley.
Tattapani in Madhya Pradesh is another
promising geothermal area in India.
<br>
<br>
Magneto Hydro-dynamics Power
MHD power generation is a method,
whereby thermal energy is directly converted
into electrical energy instead of thermal energy
being converted to mechanical energy and then
to the electrical energy as is done in the power
plants. In this process, coal is burnt to produce
hot and high speed gas which is allowed to pass
over a strong magnetic field and this result in
the direct conversion of thermal energy into
electrical energy. It is capable of achieving net
efficiency of around 60 per cent, while in the
conventional power plants it is only 35 per cent.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bio-Engery</i></strong></div>

Bio-energy includes those processes where
biological forms of matter, such as, plants,
vegetables, enzymes, etc. provide the basis for
energy or its conversion from one form to another
form of energy. The widest use of bio-energy is
in the traditional way, where wood plants and
agricultural matter are directly burnt to provide
heat. Vegetable biomass is a new name for plant
organic matter, wherein solar energy is trapped
and stored through the process of photosynthesis
in which carbon dioxide and water are
transformed and form energy-rich organic
compounds.
<br>
<br>
Biomass covers a wide range of materials,
encompassing all kinds of animal, organic and
synthetic wastes and a special variety of
vegetation-wild grass, shrubs and some plants
and trees, especially cultivated to derive energy
and useful by products and this biotechnology
is one of the oldest manufacturing activities,
having started ever since man learnt to produce
bread, wine, beer and cheese. However, only
recently the process is well understood and
mankind has started to move in the right
direction to make better use of this revolutionary
technology. The major components of biomass
are mainly carbohydrates - sugars, starches and
cellulose - with variable nitrogen and
phosphorous contents. Animals, organic and
synthetic wastes cover the balance components.
There are three basic systems for conversion of
biomass into energy resources.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Combustion Pyrolysis: Chemical
decomposition through high
temperature. (upto 5000°C) in partial
or total absence of air to produce fuel
gas, oil (methanol) and charcoal.</li>
        <li>Biogasification: Anaerobic digestion of
biomass to produce combustible gas
(biogas) comprising of methane,
hydrogen, etc.</li>
        <li>Fermentation: Conversion of sugar and
starch into alcohol to produce ethanol
and solid residual fuel.
The potential of biomass in India is estimated
at 1250 MMTPA which is about one-eightieth
of the global total. Energy available from such a
massive biomass is equivalent to about 300 MMT
of oil.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>ALTERNATIVE FUELS</i></strong></div>    
        
Compressed Natural Gas or CNG is a
cleaner alternative to the liquid petroleum. CNG
is already in use in countries such as the USA,
Japan, Italy, Brazil and New Zealand. In Delhi,
the Supreme Court has directed the operation
of city buses exclusively on CNG fuel mode.The
government on its part launched CNG pilot
project in Delhi as early as 1993. Thanks to this
project, CNG is now available in the NCR and
most cities of the country.
<br>
<br>
CNG is cleaner fuel than the conventional
fuel (petrol and diesel) as far as PM is concerned.
Further, CO, HC and NOX emission for CNG
based car are lower because of the catalytic
converter fitted with them.
Gasohol: It is a mixture of absolute alcohol
and petrol and is being tried as a fuel to run a
car. A programme of 5 per cent blending of
ethanol with petrol is already underway with
effect from November 2006 targeting 20 States
and 4 UTs. Subject to availability, the percentage
of blend can be enhanced to 10 per cent as
specification for petrol with 10 per cent ethanol
blend is already given by the BIS. At present,
the EBP Programme is successfully running in
14 States and three UTs; OMCs have been able
to contract 55.87 crore litres of ethanol against
the requirement of 105 crore litres of ethanol
for 5 per cent blending in the entire notified area.
The Mysore Sugar Company of Madya tried
out a 25:75 proportion mix of absolute alcohol
and patrol for maximum efficiency. A fuel
economy of 3 to 5 per cent has been reported
when gasohol is used as a fuel.
<br>
<br>
Hydrogen: Hydrogen appears to be a
favoured alternative due to its high specific
energy per unit weight, its almost universal
availability as a component of water, good
combustion characteristics and the fact that it is
environment-friendly. The primary combustion
product is water vapour and apart from low
nitric oxide fractions, there are virtually no
harmful exhaust gases, in particular no carbon
monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulates which
are the bane of petrofuel combustion.
From the safety angle, there is however one
major problem with hydrogen, its low density
and high diffusion capacity, which leads to a
high permeation capability through systems
which are normally considered to be gas-tight.
The low density of hydrogen means that it rises
quickly into the atmosphere if proper venting is
done. Today, the technology to make hydrogen
leak-proof components is available. Also any
leakages can be monitored and displayed with
hydrogen sensitive sensors.
<br>
<br>
Hydrogen is being aggressively explored as
a fuel for passenger vehicles. It can be used in
fuel cells to power electric motors or burned in
internal combustion engines (ICEs). It is an
environmentally friendly fuel that has the
potential to dramatically reduce our dependence
on imported oil, but several significant challenges
must be overcome before it can be widely used.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NON-CONVENTIONAL
ENERGY PROGRAMME</i></strong></div>

The need to increase total domestic energy
production in order to reduce import
dependence, combined with the need to move
away from fossil fuels in the longer run in view
of climate change considerations, points to the
need for stronger efforts to increase the supply
of energy from renewables. Union Minister of
New and Renewable Energy, Dr. Farooq
Abdullah has said that India is committed to
increasing the share of renewable power in the
electricity mix to 15 per cent by the year 2020.
He said an action plan has already been
developed that aims at accelerating the
deployment of renewable energy with a target
of around 30 GW of renewable power by 2017.
The potential for renewable power has been
revised upward over time. In the early 80s, India
was estimated to have renewable energy
potential of about 85 GW from commercially
exploitable sources, viz. (i) Wind: 50 GW (at 50
m mast height) (ii) Small Hydro: 15 GW 
(iii) Bioenergy: 20 GW and (iv) solar radiation sufficient
to generate 50 MW/sq. km using solar
photovoltaic and solar thermal energy. These
estimates have since been revised to reflect
technological advancements. Initial estimates
from Centre for Wind Energy Technology
(C-WET) suggest that wind energy potential at
80 metres height (with 2 per cent land
availability) would be over 100 GW. Some studies
have estimated even higher potential ranges up
to 300 GW. The MNRE has initiated an exercise
for realistic reassessment of the wind power
potential, whose results are expected by the end
of 2013.
<br>
<br>
India’s renewable energy installed capacity
has grown from 3.9 GW in 2002-2003 to about
27.3 GW in January 2013. Wind energy has been
the predominant contributor to this growth. It
also accounts for 68% of the installed capacity,
followed by small hydro power (3.55 GW),
biomass power (3.56 GW) and solar power (1.4
GW).
The Indian renewable energy programme
has been in place for a little over two decades
during which period the renewable energy
industry has taken a number of initiatives that
have given a major thrust to the programme.
Way back in 1980, the Government created the
Commission on Additional Sources of Energy
(CASE) under the department of Science and
Technology. In September 1982, the Department
of Non-conventional Energy Sources (DNES)
was set up, and then in July 1992, it grew into a
full fledged Ministry of Non-conventional Energy
Sources (MNES). In 2006, this ministry was
renamed as Ministry of New and Renewable
Energy (MNRE). Interestingly, India is the only
country in the world to have a dedicated ministry
responsible for implementing a non-conventional
energy trajectory in India.
The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
is the nodal Ministry of the Government of India
for all matters relating to new and renewable
energy. The broad aim of the Ministry is to
develop and deploy new and renewable energy
for supplementing the energy requirements of
the country.
<br>
<br>
The Mission of the Ministry is to ensure:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Energy Security: Lesser dependence on oil
imports through development and
deployment of alternate fuels (hydrogen,
bio-fuels and synthetic fuels) and their
applications to contribute towards bridging
the gap between domestic oil supply and
demand;</li>
        <li>Increase in the share of clean power:
Renewable (bio, wind, hydro, solar,
geothermal & tidal) electricity to
supplement fossil fuel based electricity
generation;</li>
        <li>Energy Availability and Access:
Supplement energy needs of cooking,
heating, motive power and captive
generation in rural, urban, industrial and
commercial sectors;</li>
        <li>Energy Affordability: Cost-competitive,
convenient, safe, and reliable new and
renewable energy supply options;</li>
        <li>Energy Equity: Per-capita energy
consumption at par with the global average
level by 2050, through a sustainable and
diverse fuel- mix.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>POLICY ON NON-CONVENTIONAL ENERGY</i></strong></div>

The MNES implements one of the world’s
largest programme on renewable energy. The
programme objectives are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Increase the share of renewables in the
overall installed capacity of power
generation.</li>
        <li>Meet the energy needs of rural and
remote areas for variety of applications.</li>
        <li>Minimise the drudgery and health
hazards faced by rural women in
following the age old practice of cooking
with fuel wood collected from long
distances,</li>
        <li>Extract energy from urban and
industrial wastes, besides ocean,
chemical and geothermal sources.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

According to the Annual Report of the
MNES, the underlying idea of the programme is
not to substitute but supplement the
conventional energy generation in meeting the
basic energy needs of the community at large.
The government started off with
programmes in research and development (R &
D) in all renewable energy technologies with a
view to standardising and ensuring that the
technologies were in a position to deliver reliable
and safe energy. In order to offset partially the
high first cost, the MNES offered incentives by
way of upfront capital subsidy and also interest
subsidy in order to reduce the cost of financing
for renewable technologies by individuals and
the private sector. In addition, 100 per cent
accelerated depreciation was allowed for firms
that invested in RETS.
<br>
<br>
Technical back-up units (TBUS) were set up
in different parts of the country to provide
support to various institutions wanting
additional support on RETs. The TBUs also
undertook promotional programmes and
training for the local agencies working on RETs.
The Indian Renewable Development Agency
(IREDA) was set up to finance exclusively
renewable energy programmes.
The MNES has taken up special programmes
for renewable energy in the north-eastern region
including Sikkim and has earmarked 10 per cent
of the Plan funds for this region towards
enhanced and special subsidies. A special
programme to electrify the Kargil and Ladakh
areas districts with 90% as grant from the centre
is also under implementation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE
GOVERNMENT</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Urja Grams</i></strong></div>    
        
The Department of Non-Conventional
Energy Sources has taken up a programme on
Rural Renewable Energy System (RRES)
designed to make villages self-sufficient in
energy. This system is called Urja Grams, and
are based on local renewable energy sources and
being environmentally benign, could ensure
availability of electric power as well as cooking
energy at the village level and spearhead all
round rural development.
In an Urja Gram, the renewable energy
devices can find their applications to meet the
just energy requirement. For example, a biogas
plant working on locally available animal and
agricultural waste would supply the cooking fuel
and also fuel for lighting or for irrigation
wherever required. Requirement of drying,
cooking, hot water, etc. can be met by Solar
Thermal Systems.
<br>
<br>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Tidal Energy in Sunderbans</i></strong></div>
            
The Union Ministry of Non-conventional
Energy Sources (MNES) has sanctioned a 90 per
cent grant for the Rs.48-crore project in
Sunderbans. The West Bengal government will
meet the remaining cost of this project. The
National Hydroelectric Power Corporation
(NHPC) has been chosen the contractor for the
project, which is being executed by the West
Bengal Green Energy Development Corporation,
the corporate entity which has been formed by
the West Bengal government to commercialize
its renewable energy forays.
<br>
<br>
The Sunderbans project will be a
demonstrative project which may be replicated,
although the Kutch and the Gulf of Cambay in
Gujarat are the only two regions in the country
where there is known potential of this form of
green energy. For the people living in the villages
around the Durgaduani Creek, solar home
lighting systems is the only form of electricity
known, with the slightly better-off burning
gallons of diesel to run polluting generator sets
to draw power. An eight MW capacity has been
created so far for 4.4 million people, who may
never have had any access to electric power since
they stay in remote areas where conventional
power may never reach. Efforts are now on to
bring an additional five million people under this
coverage by 2012.</li>
        <li>Electricity Generation from Human Waste
An electricity generation fuelled by sewage
has been developed. The waste we flush down
the toilet could one day power the lights at home.
A generator does the job of a sewage-treatment
plant at the same time as it breaks down the
harmful organic matter as it generates the
electricity. Harnessing chemical techniques
similar to those the body uses to break down
food, Pennsylvania State’s microbial fuel cell
(MFC) diverts the electrons liberated in the
reaction to produce electrical energy.
The MFC comprises of a sealed 15 cm long
can with a central cathode rod surrounded by a
proton exchange membrane (PEM) which is
permeable only to protons. Sewage processing
plants are needed in developing countries but
they are expensive, as they use too much power.
Producing electricity at the same time will offset
this cost. A slurry of bacteria and undigested
food consisting of organic matter such as
carbohydrates, proteins and lipids are contained
in sewage. In a process that releases electrons,
the bacteria found in sewage treatment works
use enzymes to oxidise organic matter. Normally
the electrons power respiratory reaction in the
bacteria cells, and are combined with oxygen
molecules. The organic waste is broken down
by bacteria that cluster around the anodes as
organic waste is pumped in releasing electrons
and protons with no oxygen to help mop up the
electrons, bacteria’s enzymes transfer them to the
anodes, while the protons migrate through
protons are encouraged to pass through to the
cathode by polarised molecules on the P&M
(Proton exchange membrane) which is
permeable only to protons. There they combine
with oxygen from the air and electrons from the
cathode to produce water. It is this transfer of
electrons at the electrodes that sets up the
voltage between them, enabling the cell to power
an external circuit.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL SOLAR MISSION</i></strong></div>

The Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar
Mission, also known as National Solar Mission,
is one of the eight key National Mission’s which
comprise India’s National Action Plan on
Climate Change (NAPCC). NAPCC was
launched on 30th June 2008 which identified
development of solar energy technologies in the
country as a National Mission. Finally on
January 11, 2010 Government of India approved
National Solar Mission.
<br>
<br>
The Solar Mission recommends the
implementation in 3 stages leading up to an
installed capacity of 20,000 MW by the end of
the 13th Five Year Plan in 2022. It serves twin
purpose:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Long term energy Security</li>
        <li>Ecological Security</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Objective:</b>
 Objective of National Solar Mission is to
establish India as a global leader in solar
energy, by creating the policy conditions for
its diffusion across the country as quickly as
possible. The Mission adopts a 3-phase
<br>
<br>
<b>approach:</b>
<br>
Phase 1: spanning the first year of the 12th Plan
<br>
Phase 2: the remaining 4 years of the 12th Plan
<br>
Phase 3: the 13th Plan
<br>
<br>
The immediate aim of the Mission is to
focus on setting up an enabling environment
 for solar technology penetration in the country
both at a centralized and decentralized level.
Also the Mission anticipates achieving grid parity
by 2022 and parity with coal-based thermal
power by 2030.
The mission targets are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To create an enabling policy framework for
the deployment of 20,000 MW of solar
power by 2022.</li>
        <li>To ramp up capacity of grid-connected
solar power generation to 1000 MW within
three years – by 2013; an additional 3000
MW by 2017 through the mandatory use
of the renewable purchase obligation by
utilities backed with a preferential tariff.
This capacity can be more than doubled –
reaching 10,000MW installed power by
2017 or more, based on the enhanced and
enabled international finance and
technology transfer.</li>
        <li>The ambitious target for 2022 of 20,000 MW
or more, will be dependent on the ‘learning’
of the first two phases, which if successful,
could lead to conditions of grid-competitive
solar power.</li>
        <li>The transition could be appropriately
upscaled, based on availability of
international finance and technology.</li>
        <li>To create favourable conditions for solar
manufacturing capability, particularly solar
thermal power for indigenous production
and market leadership.</li>
        <li>To promote programmes for off grid
applications, reaching 1000 MW by 2017
and 2000 MW by 2022.</li>
        <li>To achieve 15 million sq. meters solar
thermal collector area by 2017 and 20
million sq.mts. by 2022.</li>
        <li>To deploy 20 million solar lighting systems
for rural areas by 2022.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONAL HYDROGEN
ENERGY ROAD MAP</i></strong></div>

Hydrogen holds the promise to provide clean,
reliable and sustainable energy supply for
meeting the growing energy needs for
transportation and power generation in the
coming years. Hydrogen can be used directly as
a fuel for producing mechanical/electrical
energy through internal combustion engines. It
can also be used in fuel cells to generate electricity
for stationary, portable and transport
applications. Hydrogen is environmentally
benign and has the potential to replace liquid
fossil fuels in the future and thereby provide
energy security to India.
Recognizing the importance of hydrogen as
an energy carrier for the future, the Ministry of
New and Renewable Energy, as the nodal
Ministry for this sector, has been implementing
a broad based Research, Development and
Demonstration Programme on Hydrogen Energy
and Fuel Cell Technologies for more than two
decades. In recent years, significant progress has
been reported by several countries, including
India in the development of hydrogen as an
alternative fuel both for automotive and
stationary applications.
<br>
<br>
A National Hydrogen Energy Road Map
(NHERM) was prepared by a Steering Group set
up by the National Hydrogen Energy Board,
under the Chairmanship of Shri Ratan Tata. The
National Hydrogen Energy Road Map was
approved by the National Hydrogen Energy
Board in January, 2006.
The NHERM has identified research,
development and demonstration efforts to be
undertaken in the country for bridging the
technological gaps in different areas of hydrogen
energy, including its production, storage,
transportation and delivery, applications, safety,
codes and standards and capacity building for
the period up to 2020. The Road Map has
emphasised on development of the total
hydrogen energy system, which includes all the
above components of hydrogen energy sector.
Keeping in view the present status of
development of hydrogen energy, the NHERM
has recommended two major initiatives for
promoting the use of hydrogen as a fuel for Green
Transportation (Green Initiative for Future
Transportation-GIFT) and Green Power
Generation (Green Initiative for Power
Generation-GIP).
<br>
<br>
The National Hydrogen Energy Road Map
has visualized that by 2020, one million
hydrogen fuelled vehicles, mostly two and three
wheelers and 1,000 MW aggregate hydrogen
based power generation capacity would be
established in the country. A total investment
requirement of Rs. 25,000 crores has been
projected in the Road Map for creating the
required hydrogen supply infrastructure to
realize the goals of one million vehicles and 1,000
MW power generation capacities by 2020,
including Rs. 1,000 crores for research,
development and demonstration activities. The
Road Map is a public-private partnership driven
process.
Hydrogen is high in energy content as it
contains 120.7 MJ/kg, which is the highest for
any known fuel. However, its energy content
compared to volume is rather low. This poses
challenges with regard to its storage for civilian
applications, when compared to storage of liquid
fossil fuels. When burnt, hydrogen produces
water as a by-product and is, therefore,
environmentally benign. Although no CO2, etc.
are produced if hydrogen is burnt in air, yet NOx
will be formed at high temperatures. One of the
advantages of hydrogen as a fuel is that it can
be used directly in the existing internal
combustion engines and turbines. It can also be
used as a fuel in fuel cells for electricity
generation. Hydrogen applications, besides
industrial application, cover power generation,
transport applications and heat. However, when
compared to other alternatives, use of hydrogen
in transport sector appears to be more beneficial
as it is possible to store hydrogen on-board.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Initiatives Taken So Far</i></strong></div>

The Ministry has supported research,
development and demonstration projects on
various aspects of hydrogen energy including its
production, storage and use as a fuel for
generation of mechanical/thermal/electrical
energy. The application of hydrogen in fuel cells
for power generation has been demonstrated as
a result of initiatives taken by this Ministry.
Hydrogen fuelled small power generating sets,
two wheelers (motor cycles), three wheelers and
catalytic combustion systems for residential and
industrial sectors have also been developed and
demonstrated.
<br>
<br>
A Demonstration Project for setting up of a
Hydrogen Dispensing Station at a petrol pump
in New Delhi has been sanctioned as a joint
project of Ministry of New and Renewable
Energy and Indian Oil Corporation Limited. The
project would enable dispensing of neat
hydrogen and H-CNG blends as fuel for
automotive vehicles. The project was
commissioned in March, 2010. The H-CNG
blends used in the modified CNG vehicles and
are expected to reduce emissions from H-CNG
vehicles, as compared to CNG vehicles. The
project is also generating operational experience
in handling hydrogen as an automotive fuel. HCNG is a vehicle fuel which is a blend of
compressed natural gas and hydrogen, typically
8-50% hydrogen by volume.
The research was initiated by the Ministry
of Petroleum and Natural gas in 2003. A
Hydrogen Corpus Fund (HCF) of Rs 100 crore
was created with contribution from all PSU oil
and gas companies and Oil Industry
Development Board (OIDB). Out of the total
allocated amount of Rs 100 crore to the oil
industry, IOC R&D has utilised Rs 14 crore for
various demonstration projects. This is in
addition to other projects funded by MNRE and
also IOC R&D's own budget. IOCL is all praise
for H-CNG's efficiency.
<br>
<br>
Another project for the introduction of HCNG blends on a trial basis in existing CNG
Vehicles has been undertaken by the Ministry of
New and Renewable Energy jointly with the
Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers
(SIAM). The project is the first public-private
partnership project in this new technology area.
The project aims for the introduction of H-CNG
blend as a fuel on trial basis in buses, cars and
three wheelers. The Indian Oil Corporation is
also participating in this project and the existing
hydrogen dispensing facility set up at its R&D
Centre at Faridabad used for fuelling the
vehicles. Under this project, the engines of the
existing CNG vehicles and fuel injection systems
would be modified. The project aims at
optimizing the H-CNG blend ratio for optimal
vehicle performance and minimal emissions.
Several new R&D Projects in the area of
Hydrogen Energy and Fuel Cell technology have
been sanctioned to Universities, IITs and R&D
organizations and further proposals are in the
pipeline. A National Centre for Hydrogen
Energy and Fuel Cell Technology is being set up
at the Solar Energy Centre Campus of the
Ministry at Gurgaon, Haryana.
<br>
<br>
The National Hydrogen Energy Road Map
had recommended 8 Technology Missions to be
taken up in this area. Work has been initiated
in two of these areas i.e. on the Development of
Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, for which the CGCRI and
BHEL have submitted a joint - R&D project
proposal to the Ministry. A proposal for
accelerated commercialization of PEM Fuel cells
in mission mode is being developed.
In June 2012, to make India a fuel efficient
country by switching to a hydrogen-based fuel
cell economy, the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC)
has developed hydrogen mixed CNG. It is 15-20
per cent more efficient than normal CNG. The
use of Hydrogen-CNG fuel is expected to reduce
carbon monoxide emissions up to 25 per cent,
THC (total hydrocarbon) emissions by 5 per cent
and carbon dioxide emissions by 5 per cent as
compared to CNG, revealed the IOC (R&D),
Faridabad.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BIOFUEL MISSION</i></strong></div>

Karanj (Pongamia pinnata) and Jatropha
(Jatropha curcas) are the two plants India is
emphasizing on for promoting alternative energy
sources, as the country launches a nationwide
biofuel mission.
A committee of experts was set up by the
Federal Planning Commission, which will study
and suggest measures for the promotion of
biofuels development. In a report submitted by
the committee before the commission, the
committee has recommended the government to
launch a countrywide biofuels mission focusing
on encouraging the cultivation of Karanj and
Jatropha. Karanj and Jatropha are two seedbearing, drought-tolerant perennial tree-crops.
The national mission launched in two phases
with one goal:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The objective of the mission is to attain the
goal of 20% blending of biofuels with diesel
and gasoline nationwide.</li>
        <li>Under a first demonstration phase Jatropha
and Karanj plantations would be
established on 400,000 hectares of
government-owned land.</li>
        <li>In the second phase of the
mission, Jatropha will be cultivated on not
less than 11.2 million hectares of
government-owned as well as private land
for increasing biodiesel production.
There’s a requirement of 2.6 million tons
biodiesel in India in order to achieve its goal of
5% blending with fossil fuels.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The Government of India approved the
National Policy on Biofuels in December 2009.
The biofuel policy encouraged the use of
renewable energy resources as alternate fuels to
supplement transport fuels (petrol and diesel for
vehicles) and proposed a target of 20 percent
biofuel blending (both bio-diesel and bio-ethanol)
by 2017. The government launched the National
Bio-diesel Mission (NBM) identifying Jatropha as
the most suitable tree-borne oilseed for bio-diesel
production. The Planning Commission of India
had set an ambitious target covering 11.2 to 13.4
million hectares of land under Jatropha
cultivation by the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan.
The central government and several state
governments are providing fiscal incentives for
supporting plantations of Jatropha and other
non-edible oilseeds. Several public institutions,
state biofuel boards, state agricultural universities
and cooperative sectors are also supporting the
biofuel mission in different capacities.
Biofuels market in India is largely based on
Ethanol - derived from the molasses of sugarcane
- and biodiesel that’s obtained through non edible
oil seeds for example Pongamia and Jatropha.
The primary objectives of the govt. for
encouraging biofuels industry include
environmental factors, plus security and
diversity of energy supply. This is also working
as the key driver for the growth of biofuel
industry in India.
<br>
<br>
Biogas: Biogas is a clean, unpolluted and
cheap source of energy in rural areas. It contains
55 to 70 per cent methane, which is inflammable.
Biogas is produced from cattle dung in a ‘Biogas
Plant’ commonly known as ‘Gobargas Plant’,
through a process called ‘digestion’. The
manurial value of the dung is enhanced in the
process. A biogas plant helps in obtaining both
cooking fuel and enriched manure from the
same quantity of cattle dung. Village sanitation
is also improved. Environmental conditions are
upgraded as the forest cover is protected by
saving fuelwood. Biogas is also used for lighting
purpose. It could also be used for running
engines of small horsepower. Large scale
promotion of biogas plants helps to generate
employment for masons, village technicians and
unskilled workers in rural areas.
<br>
<br>
The National Project for Biogas Development
(NPBD) is being implemented by the Department
of Non-conventional Energy Sources in
co-operation with State Departments, State
Nodal Agencies and Non-Governmental
Agencies. NPBD caters to the promotion of family
type biogas plants. It was started in 1981-82. The
broad objectives of the project are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide energy in a clean and
unpolluted form;</li>
        <li>To produce enriched manure to
supplement the use of chemical
fertilizers;</li>
        <li>To bring improvement in the life of rural
womenfolk and children by relieving
them from drudgery;</li>
        <li>To improve sanitation and hygiene.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Setting up of community and institutional
biogas plants was initiated in 1982-83 to provide
benefits of biogas technology to weaker sections
of society also, who otherwise cannot afford
family type biogas plants. This programme
provides financial assistance upto 90% of the
capital cost of village-based community biogas
plants. Plants set up by Central and State
Government institutions, Co-operatives or Trusts
tied to such bodies are eligible to receive financial
assistance upto 70% of the capital cost.
Biogas production is a clean low carbon
technology for efficient management and
conversion of organic wastes into clean
renewable biogas and organic fertilizer source.
It has the potential for leveraging sustainable
livelihood development as well as tackling local
(land, air and water) and global pollution. Biogas
obtained by anaerobic digestion of cattle dung
and other loose and leafy organic matters/
wastes can be used as energy source for cooking,
lighting and other applications like refrigeration,
electricity generation and transport applications.
Bio-Alternative to Diesel: After introducing
ethanol-blended petrol in selected states, the
centre has now drawn up a Rs. 1,430 crore plan
to make use of oil from the seeds of the Jatropha
plant as a bio-alternative to diesel. The plan,
which is to be implemented with a mission mode
approach, is expected to generate six lakh tonnes
of diesel-quality oil valued at Rs. 1,020 crore per
annum at the end of a gestation period of four
years.
<br>
<br>
For the purpose of the project, Jatropha
plantations would be raised in an area of four
lakh hectares spread over eight states- Andhra
Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh,
Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya
Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Bio-Diesel Policy</i></strong></div>

As per the announcement of Ministry of
Petroleum & Natural Gas, beginning from
January 1, 2006, the public sector oil marketing
companies (OMCs) will be purchasing bio-diesel
(B100) at Rs. 25 a litre for blending with diesel
(HSD) to the extent of 20 per cent in phases. To
start with, five per cent of bio-diesel, a non-edible
oil extracted from ‘Jatropha’ and ‘Pongamia,’
would be mixed with diesel during trial runs.
At a later stage, in phases, the B100 blending
with diesel is to be increased to 20 per cent.
Automobile engines would not require any
modification for using diesel doped with 20 per
cent bio-diesel as fuel.
<br>
<br>
Only those bio-diesel manufacturers who get
their samples approved and certified by the oil
companies and registered as authorised suppliers
will be eligible for assured purchase of product.
Accordingly, starting January 1, 2006, the OMCs
- Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum
Corporation Limited (BPCL) and Hindustan
Petroleum Corporation Limited are purchasing,
through select purchase centres, bio-diesel that
meets the fuel quality standards prescribed by
the Bureau of Industrial Standards (BIS).
Biodiesel: Jatropha plantation is a subject for
state governments. Public-sector petroleum
companies and private sector firms have entered
into a MoU with state governments to establish
and promote Jatropha plantation on government
wastelands or to contract with small and
medium farmers. However, only a few states
have been able to promote actively Jatropha
plantation despite the government’s incentives
and encouraging policies.
<br>
<br>
There are about 20 large-capacity biodiesel
plants (10,000 to 200,000 metric tons per year)
in India that produce biodiesel from alternative
feed stocks such as edible oil waste (unusable oil
fractions), animal fat and inedible oils.
Presently, commercial production and
marketing of Jatropha-based biodiesel in India
is small, with estimates varying from 140 to 300
million litres per year. The biodiesel produced is
sold to the unorganized sector (irrigation pumps,
mobile towers, kilns, agricultural usage, owners
of diesel generators, etc.) and to experimental
projects carried out by automobile manufacturers
and transport companies. However, as per
industry sources, there has been no commercial
sale of biodiesel to state owned transport
companies except for trials.
Additionally, there has been no commercial
sale of biodiesel across the biodiesel purchase
centres (set up by the GOI) as the government
biodiesel purchase price of Rs. 26.5 per litre is
still below the estimated biodiesel finished
production cost (Rs 35 to Rs 40 per litre).
Unavailability of feedstock supply (Jatropha
seeds), rising wage rates and inefficient
marketing channels are a few of the major factors
that have contributed to higher production costs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND PROJECTS</i></strong></div>

Various programmes are being implemented
under the MNES to promote new and emerging
renewable energy technologies such as fuel cells,
hydrogen energy, electric vehicles, geothermal
energy and tidal energy.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Fuel Cells: Through this device the chemical
energy of a fuel can be converted into usable
electricity and heat without combustion as
an intermediate step. Hydrogen is the
primary fuel in this device, which can be
produced from renewable sources of energy.
Because of modular nature, fuel cells are
ideally suited for distributed power
generation.</li>
        <li>Geothermal Energy: Geothermal energy is
collected from a vast reservoir of heat in
the interior of the earth. About 340
geothermal hot springs have been identified
throughout the country. Use of geothermal
energy has been demonstrated for small
scale power generations and thermal
applications.</li>
        <li>Ocean Energy: The Ocean acts as a natural
collector of solar energy. The temperature
gradients, waves and tides contained by
ocean can be used to generate electricity in
an eco-friendly manner. Likewise, flowing
tidal water contain large amounts of
potential energy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIA’S ENERGY SECURITY</i></strong></div>

Energy security involves ensuring
uninterrupted supply of energy to support the
economic and commercial activities necessary for
sustained economic growth. Energy security is
obviously more difficult to ensure if there is large
dependence on imported energy. This calls for
action in several areas.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The domestic production of coal, oil and
gas and other energy sources has to be
stepped up. Some of the recent issues in
this regard have been availability of land,
clearances for environment and forest and
implementation of the Scheduled Tribes and
Other Traditional Forest Dwellers
(Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006.
Uncertainty about production sharing
contracts has also posed problems.
Management strategies and procedures will
have to be devised for ensuring effective
implementation of fuel development
projects while meeting the requirements of
above policies and legislations.</li>
        <li>A stable and attractive policy regime has
to be provided to ensure substantial private
investment, including foreign investment in
oil and natural gas blocks and new
capacities for renewable energy. Producers
must have clarity in the price they will
receive and an assurance of a stable tax
regime. Since oil exploration is a global
industry the terms India offers must be
comparable with those offered elsewhere.
In this context the entire structure of New
Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP)
contracts for oil and gas need to be
reviewed.</li>
        <li>Investments in renewable energies need to
be strongly emphasised. By present
projections, the share of renewable energy
in total energy consumption will only reach
2 per cent by 2021.</li>
        <li>Investments in energy assets in foreign
countries, especially for coal, oil and gas
and uranium should be stepped up.</li>
        <li>To meet any possible disruption in oil
supplies, on which we are importdependent to the extent of more than 80
per cent, storage capacities need to be
created. The Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries have generally created these
capacities to the extent of 90 days of their
domestic demand. We have created the
capacity for 5 million tonnes. It has,
however, not been fully utilised so far.
There will be a need to increase this
gradually and utilise it fully. Innovative
ways will have to be found to fill up these
tankages.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RAJIV GANDHI GRAMEEN
VIDYUTIKARAN YOJNA</i></strong></div>

A scheme ‘Rajiv Gandhi Grameen
Vidyutikaran Yojana’ for a Rural Electricity
Infrastructure and Household Electrification was
launched in April, 2005 for the attainment of
the National Common Minimum Programme of
providing access to electricity to all Rural
Household in five years. The scheme involved
electrification of all unelectrified villages plus a
free connection for BPL households.
The Ministry of Power has been entrusted
with the responsibility of providing electricity to
the uncovered villages through the programme
instrument of Rajiv Gandhi Grameen
Vidyutikaran Yojana. Rural Electrification
Corporation (REC) would be the implementation
agency of the scheme which covers the entire
country. To achieve this objective, Rural
Electricity Distribution Backbone will be set up
as village electrification - infrastructure. The
scheme deployment of franchisee system has also
been made mandatory so as to bring about
revenue sustainability in the rural distribution
system.
<br>
<br>
The scheme provided a subsidy of 90 per cent
of the total project cost and balance 10 per cent
of the project cost was to be provided by the
Rural Electrification Corporation (REC) as loan.
Initially, Phase I of the RGGVY scheme was
approved for implementation with a capital
subsidy of `5,000 crore during the remainder of
the 10th Plan period. Subsequently, the scheme
was approved to be continued in the 11th Plan
with a capital subsidy of 28,000 crore. Overall,
by the end of 11th Plan, out of the total 5,93,732
villages in India (Census 2001), 5,56,633 villages
(93.8 per cent) ought to have been electrified as
per CEA report.
The States of Delhi, Goa and Union Territories
of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh,
Dadar & Nagar Haveli, Daman & Diu and
Puducherry have not participated in RGGVY
Programme as they had achieved 100 per cent
electrification of villages. In remaining 27 states,
RGGVY Projects for 579 districts have been
sanctioned.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Salient Features</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The Scheme:

    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>THREAT TO ENERGY SECURITY</i></strong></div>

The threat to energy security arises not just
from the uncertainty of availability and price of
imported energy, but also from the possible
disruption or shortfalls in domestic production.
The second concern is not disruption of supply
but the market risk of a sudden increase in oil
price. While we may be able to pay for imports,
a high oil price can cause inflation, slow down
the economy and impose hardship on the people.
Any disruption in access to energy can be very
expensive in welfare terms as energy is critical
not only for economic growth but also for human
survival and well-being.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reduce Energy Requirements</i></strong></div>

Improvement in energy efficiency or
conservation is akin to creating a new domestic
energy resource base. Such efficiency
improvements can be made in energy extraction,
conversion, transmission, distribution and enduse of energy. All of these efficiency
improvements can come using currently
available commercial technologies.
Energy efficiency and demand side
management also have a large scope to reduce
energy requirement. These include the use of
energy efficient appliances and automobiles,
hybrid cars, energy efficient buildings, efficient
lighting, cogeneration, distributed generation
with Combined Heat and Power (CHP) use,
energy efficient and well-maintained irrigation
pumps, smokeless improved woodstoves, etc.
In the long-term, promotion of public
transport in urban areas can significantly reduce
energy consumption, particularly the need for
imported oil and gas. Develop effective and
attractive mass transport such as underground,
elevated trains, light rail, monorail or dedicated
bus lanes in existing metros.
<br>
<br>
Substitute Domestic Alternatives
Energy security can be increased by reducing
the need for imported energy by substituting it
with other forms of energy. Though this does
not reduce the need for total energy, it reduces
import dependence. Some important options
include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Wood plantations with a potential of
yielding up to 20 tonnes of wood per
hectare per year in a sustainable way could
significantly expand the domestic energy
resource base. Wood can be burned directly
or gasified for power generation. This would
reduce the need for future gas/coal imports.</li>
        <li>Bio-diesel and Ethanol can substitute diesel
and petrol. Ethanol can be obtained from
molasses, which may have other
economically more paying uses. Ethanol
can also be obtained from other starchy
crops and from cellulosic plant matter.</li>
        <li>If hydrogen can be produced as a
byproduct of industry or with locally
available energy sources, hydrogen based
vehicles could provide an option to reduce
dependence on oil imports.</li>
        <li>Coal can be converted into oil as is done in
South Africa. The technology is welldeveloped and in use for years.
Develop Alternative Sources
Enhanced Recovery: Enhanced oil, gas and
coal recovery from existing fields is an obvious
option. India’s recovery of in-place reserves can
improve easily by 5-10 percentage points. Better
mine design and the use of technologically
advanced mining techniques are valid options.
Coal Bed Methane: Methane is absorbed in
coal seams. This Coal Bed Methane (CBM)
usually escapes into the atmosphere when coal
is mined. Tapping and utilizing the CBM as a
source of commercial energy has been in vogue
in the US and Australia for several years. The
estimated potential of CBM in India is in the
range of 1400-2600 billion cu. metres (BCM).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


The potential of Coal Bed Methane/Coal
Mine Methane was recognised in a new policy
of Government of India in 1997. The Ministry of
Coal and the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural
Gas are working together for the development
of Coal Bed Methane and the Government has
offered 33 blocks in four rounds of bidding for
CBM covering 17,416 sq. km of area. One block
in Raniganj coalfield has commenced
commercial production in 2007 and two blocks
are in advanced stage of commencing
production.
<br>
<br>
The Director General of Hydrocarbons is the
regulator for CBM activities in the country. The
CBM/CMM clearance house has been
established in CMPDIL, Ranchi, in collaboration
with United States Environment Protection
Agency (USEPA) which will provide information
for development of CBM/CMM in India. The
current level of production, being only 0.2
mmscmd, is confined mostly to the private sector.
There is no separate pricing regime for CBM and
the gas prices are determined by the developer,
subject to Government approval.
Coal to Oil: Rising oil prices in the world
market makes conversion of coal to oil
economically attractive. India should establish
the viability of Sasol technology with domestic
coal and establish the breakeven price at which
coal to liquids would make sense for Indian coal.
New Domestic Sources: The domestic
resource base can also be expanded through
developing hitherto poorly developed or new
sources of energy. Some of these resources may
require R & D to make them economical. Among
these are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Nuclear Power: With meagre availability
of Uranium in the country and vast
resources of Thorium, any long-term
nuclear strategy has to be based on
Thorium. The three stage strategy of
development of nuclear power from
pressurized heavy water based reactors to
fast breeder reactors to Thorium based
reactors require a sustained R & D effort.
Success in these efforts could deliver some
2, 50,000 MW of nuclear power by 2050
and much more thereafter.</li>
        <li>Gas Hydrates: Very large reserves exist in
Indian waters and have the potential to
provide vast amount of gas. Technology to
exploit these economically in ecologically
safe ways is yet to be developed.</li>
        <li>Wind: The potential for onshore wind
power has been assessed to be 45,000 MW.
The Wind Energy Society of India claims it
to be as high as 65,000 MW. However, given
that the average capacity factor realized
by India’s wind farms is only about 17
percent, the total contribution to energy
from these plants would be relatively small.
Thus while wind power may be pursued
for environmental and economic reasons,
its contribution to energy security will
remain very limited.</li>
        <li>Solar: Solar energy, if it can be
economically exploited constitutes a major
energy resource for the country. Solar
electricity generated through either the
thermal route or using photovoltaic cells
provides comparable amounts of electricity
per unit of collector area. Both methods
currently provide about 15 percent
conversion efficiency.</li>
        <li>Energy Plantations: Growing fuel wood for
running power plants either directly or after
gasification can save the coal or gas used
for generating power. Since the country’s
energy needs are growing, imports of coal
and LNG are also likely to grow. Fuel wood
plantations can help improve energy
security. The scope for such plantations is
substantial.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CONSERVATION OF ENERGY</i></strong></div>

With the development of civilization and
commercialization coupled with urbanisation
the needs of the people have grown significantly.
Human beings have exploited the resources
endlessly. These activities based upon resource
consumption have led to the problems of
degradation and depletion of energy resources.
A grim scenario of the energy resource has been
created in the form of energy crisis. A detailed
study of the background of the situation compels
us to think about the major cause of such a
situation. One can pronounce on an unequivocal
term that it is the cost of industrial development
coupled with over dependence on conventional
sources. Past generations in coping the pace of
development have harnessed the conventional
sources at an exorbitant rate with deaf ears to
future problems. A want of rationale is enshrined
in the behavioural approach of society vis-a-vis
energy consumption.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rural Electrification Corporation</i></strong></div>

Rural Electrification Corporation Limited
(REC), a Navratna Central Public Sector
Enterprise under Ministry of Power, was
incorporated on July 25, 1969 under the
Companies Act 1956. Its main objective is to
finance and promote rural electrification projects
all over the country. It provides financial
assistance to State Electricity Boards, State
Government Departments and Rural Electric
Cooperatives for rural electrification projects as
are sponsored by them.
<br>
<br>
REC provides loan assistance to SEBs/State
Power Utilities for investments in rural
electrification schemes through its Corporate
Office located at New Delhi and 17 field units
(Project Offices), which are located in most of
the States.
The Project Offices in the States coordinate
the programmes of REC’s financing with the
concerned SEBs/State Power Utilities and
facilitate in formulation of schemes, loan
sanction and disbursement and implementation
of schemes by the concerned SEBs/State Power
Utilities.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ultra Mega Power Projects</i></strong></div>

Ministry of Power launched a unique
initiative in 2005-06 to facilitate the development
of Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPPs) each
having a capacity of about 4000 MW each, at
both the coal pitheads and coastal locations
aimed at delivering power at competitive cost to
consumers by achieving economies of the scale.
The Central Government has accordingly taken
the initiative for facilitating the development of
UMPPs under tariff based competitive bidding
route using super critical technology on build,
own and operate (BOO) basis. Central Electricity
Authority (CEA) is the Technical partner and
Power Finance Corporation (PFC) is the Nodal
Agency.
<br>
<br>
The Ultra Mega Power Projects (UMPPs)
Programme, which brings in private investment
into power generation, was a major initiative of
the Eleventh Plan. So far power purchase
agreements have been signed for four UMPPs of
4,000 MW each on the basis of competitive 
tariffbased bidding. They are based in Sasan (Madhya
Pradesh), Mundra (Gujarat), Krishnapatnam
(Andhra Pradesh) and Tilaiya (Jharkhand). Out
of these, one unit of 800 MW of Mundra by Tata
Power has been commissioned in March 2012.
12 more supercritical UMPPs are being planned
covering Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu,
Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra and
Karnataka. An important element of this
programme is the induction of supercritical
technology, which is an important shift towards
energy efficiency. Unfortunately, some of these
projects are plagued with uncertainties
regarding fuel supply because they were based
on imported coal and changes in government
policies in the countries where the coal mines
were located have raised the cost of coal
whereas the power tariff is based on a
competitive bid which does not contain a
provision for passing on such increases.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAJOR NEW INITIATIVES</i></strong></div>

The following are some of the new initiatives
in the area of renewable energy:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>National Institute of Solar Energy: The
existing Solar Energy Centre would be
converted into an autonomous institution
for undertaking applied research,
demonstration and development in solar
energy, including solar hybrid areas.</li>
        <li>National Bioenergy Corporation of India:
National Bio Energy Corporation of India
(NBECI) will be set up to implement
bioenergy mission, including cook stove
programme.</li>
        <li>Renewable Energy Development Fund: In
order to address the financing constraints
for the grid connected as well as the offgrid applications of renewables, it is
proposed to create a Renewable Energy
Development fund. The fund will plug the
gap between the sector financing needs and
the amount that falls short of the banks’
obligations to their lending to this priority
sector.</li>
        <li>National Bioenergy Mission: Biomass
energy for electricity generation has turned
out to be one of the most attractive sources
of power which is scalable, has the largest
potential for improving energy access and
which can be linked to generating
additional rural income. In view of the
success of such biomass-based off-grid
renewable models in rural areas of Bihar, it
is proposed to launch the Biomass Mission
with an objective to create a policy
framework for attracting investment and
to facilitate rapid development of
commercial biomass energy market based
on utilisation of surplus agro-residues and
development of energy plantations.</li>
        <li>Renewable Power Evacuation Infrastructure: Special emphasis will be placed
on creating evacuation infrastructure and
transmission facilities for renewable power
in a time-bound manner to support the
large expansion in consumption and
production of renewable power. Judicious
planning of transmission system, that is,
creating pooling substation for cluster of
renewable power generators and
connecting them with receiving station of
STU/CTU at appropriate voltage level, will
lead to optimal utilisation of transmission
system.</li>
        <li>National Biomass Cook Stove Programme:
The proposed initiative plans to universalise
access of improved biomass cook stoves by
providing assistance in exploring a range
of technology deployments, biomass
processing and delivery models leveraging
public-private partnerships.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ACHIEVEMENTS IN POWER SECTOR
DURING THE PERIOD OF 11TH PLAN</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Capacity addition during the 11th Plan
period has been at 54,964 MW which is
69.8 per cent of the original target and 88.1
per cent of the reduced target of 62,374
MW set in the Mid-term Appraisal (MTA).
It is more than 2.5 times that of any of the
earlier Plans.</li>
        <li>Total installed capacity as on 31 March
2012, including renewable energy sources
of the country was 1,99,877 MW. The share
of renewable energy capacity being about
12.2 per cent.</li>
        <li>Total number of villages electrified till
March 2012 was about 5.6 lakhs, indicating
that more than 93 per cent village
electrification has been achieved. However,
a large number of small habitations still
remain unconnected.</li>
        <li>Various activities under different schemes
of Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) and
Ministry of Power (MoP) have resulted in
saving in avoided power capacity of 11,000
MW.</li>
        <li>Works relating to 18 units for life extension
aggregating to 1,931 MW and 69 units for
repair and maintenance (R&M) aggregating
to 17,435 MW have been completed during
the 11th Plan.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>12TH PLAN PROGRAMME</i></strong></div>

The Working Group on Power has estimated
a capacity addition requirement of 75,785 MW
corresponding to 9 per cent GDP growth during
the Twelfth Plan period. However, in order to
bridge the gap between peak demand and peak
deficit, and provide for faster retirement of the
old energy-inefficient plants, the target for the
Twelfth Plan has been fixed at 88,537 MW. The
share of the private sector in the additional
capacity will be 53 per cent, compared to a target
of 19 per cent in the Eleventh Plan. Since the
growth rate of GDP for the Twelfth Plan is likely
to be 8.2 per cent and not 9 per cent, the target
for capacity addition contain an element of slack
of about 10 per cent.
<br>
<br>
The share of power based on non-fossil fuel
plants is very low at present and should be
increased over time to promote low carbon
growth strategy. The share of coal and lignite in
the additional capacity being created during the
Twelfth Plan is 79 per cent, up from 76 per cent
in the target from the Eleventh Plan which
actually ended up at 79 per cent. The projected
capacity addition in non-fossil fuel plants covers
addition of hydro capacity of 1,0897 MW and
nuclear capacity of 5,300 MW. Besides this, 1,200
MW import of hydro power from Bhutan has
also been considered. In addition, it is planned
to add a grid interactive renewable capacity
addition of about 30,000 MW comprising of
15,000 MW wind, 10,000 MW solar, 2,100 small
hydro, and the balance primarily from bio mass.
