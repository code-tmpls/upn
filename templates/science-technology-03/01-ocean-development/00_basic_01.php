<h3>Ocean Development</h3>

The oceans and their inter-connecting seas
form a continuous territory that covers about
three-fourths of the earth’s surface. Within these
liquid expanses, there are seemingly
inexhaustible sources of food, minerals and
energy. The development of marine resources
such as fish, petroleum, sand and gravel,
desalinated water aquaculture, phosphorus and
manganese nodules, placer minerals, extracted
chemicals, fish protein concentrates, etc. is
already possible with the available technology
and major countries of the world, recognizing
the potential economic importance of marine
resources have already organized their efforts
in this area, and India, too, is making a
beginning.
<br>
<br>
A proper consideration of marine resources
should begin with an understanding of the
features characteristics of the deep ocean. The
physiographic features consist mainly of a
continental shelf extending from the beach to a
distance of up to 1300 km with outer depths of
50 to 500 metres, a continental slope slanting
gently downwards from the shelf to the ocean
depths of 3 to 5 kilometres at a slope of about 5°.
The chemical features of the ocean consist of
a complex solution of dissolved chemicals with
surprisingly uniform content of approximately
40 chemicals. A vastly more dilute and less
understood solution of trace elements and
organic constituents supports and permits life
to exist within the sea.
<br>
<br>
The biological features of the sea consist
mainly of over 10,000 known species of 
singlecelled plants called Phytoplanktons that support
all marine life through photosynthesis, an almost
equally large variety of tiny animals called
Zooplanktons, an enormous variety of
invertebrates, fishes, mammals (e.g. whales,
seals, etc.) that depend on the atmosphere for
oxygen and include some of the most intelligent
animals in the whole animal kingdom.
The major focus of marine activity today,
tends to lie in mankind’s search for food and
energy. The sea is an excellent source for a most
critical element of the human diet - animal
protein. Some 15 per cent of the world’s supply
of animal protein comes from fisheries and it has
been calculated that the potential yield, given
the proper technology is between 8 to 34 times
the world’s requirements.
<br>
<br>
The Indian Ocean produces only 2.4 million
tonnes of fish, which amount to only four per
cent of the total world production. However, the
potential fish catch from this area is estimated
to be at least four to five times more. Water which
can sustain prawn and tuna have not been fully
exploited while only minimal attention has been
paid to coastal aquaculture i.e. the culture and
raising of oysters, clams and mussels.
The success of oceanic fishing depends on
how well we determine the location of the fish
shoals and on the level of sophistication of
available marine technology in the country.
Locating, tracking and identifying fish shoals
involve two major steps—
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Searching for the general area in which
commercial concentrations are expected.</li>
        <li>Localising and detecting the precise
position of the fish. Of even more
significance in the exploitation of marine
resources is the possibility of finding oil
and gas offshore in large quantities. It has
been established that approximately 20 per
cent of the world’s reserves of oil lie
offshore. In India the major potential
offshore areas for oil and gas are the Gulf
of Cambay, Bombay High, the Indo-Sri
Lanka trough, the Bay of Bengal, the
Andaman & Nicobar Islands and Krishna
Godavari (KG) Basin.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In India among other physical resources,
heavy mineral rich beach sands containing
Monazite and Ilmenite have been found on the
Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra
Pradesh and Orissa coasts. The offshore
occurrence of calcareous deposits suitable for the
chemical and cement industries have been
reported from bottom samples off the Andaman
and Nicobar Islands, Saurashtra, Kerala and
Lakshadweep. These deposits, which represent
the remains of calcareous organism such as coal
are also expected to occur in many more areas
all around the Indian peninsula. Phosphate
nodules and Barium concentrations have been
recorded off the west coast of India and
Lakshadweep while chromite has been found in
the sea floor rifts of Indian Ocean. Efforts to
survey the extent of these resources have
however been few and far between and in the
absence of technical capabilities there have been
no systematic efforts to exploit them.
<br>
<br>
A large number of organizations have been
working in the field of ocean science and
engineering for marine resource exploitation in
India. The Geological Survey of India is
responsible for all investigations pertaining to
geological sciences excluding the exploration and
exploitation of oil and natural gas, which is
under the domain of the Oil and Natural Gas
Commission. The Atomic Energy Commission
conducts studies on the deposition and
replenishment of minerals in the coastal regions
as well as on the presence and behaviour of
radioactive elements. The Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research, Mumbai, has carried out
research in chemical oceanography. While the
Meteorological Department has done some work
in marine meteorological studies. The National
Institute of Oceanography created in 1966, is
responsible for research on the basic aspects of
physical, chemical, geological and biological
oceanography and also for handling
oceanographic data. The Naval Hydrographic
office conducts hydrographic studies.
Some state governments have their own
geological departments to carry out geological
surveys and some universities like those of
Andhra and Kerala are also involved in various
coastal studies pertaining to marine geology and
biology.
<br>
<br>
All these organizations and their research
efforts were coordinated by the Indian National
Committee of Oceanic Research (INCOR)
established by the Government of India in 1960
to draw up a programme for India’s
participation in the International Indian Ocean
Expedition during 1962-65. The task has since
been taken over by the Department of Science
and Technology, which visualizes the creation
of a separate Ocean Science and Technology
Commission to coordinate the Indian efforts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES</i></strong></div>

Phytoplanktons are the principal plants in
the ocean and are the base of the food chain.
The distribution of zooplankton which feed on
the phytoplankton is world’s major fishing areas.
Oceans have become major source of food and
are more likely to become so in future. Because
of its sheer size, oceans will have a larger food
potential. Again due to increased population,
little option is left for agricultural extension on
land and henceforth the human population will
be under compulsion to move towards the ocean
to satisfy its demands. Ocean food resources are
nutritionally advantageous or better source of
amino acids in correct proportion, better source
of vitamin-B12, low in cholesterol and fat, high
in polyunsaturated fats and essential fatty acids.
India is a littoral state with a vast coastline
of about 6000 km and the Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ) of about 2.02 million sq km. About
50 per cent of sustainable fishing zone of India’s
EEZ lies in inshore zone of less than 50 metres
depth. India ranks 8th in the annual fish catch
in the world. In India, the marine fish accounts
for about 56 per cent of the total national fish
catch. However, the annual potential in India is
about 10 million tonnes. Intensive prawn farming
has been developed at Nellore in Andhra Pradesh
and improved shrimps farming in Andaman and
Nicobar.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>FRESH-WATER RESOURCES</i></strong></div>

Oceans, ice-caps and glaciers constitute
about 97.2% and 2.15% of world’s water supply
respectively. Fresh water extracted from the sea
is one of the most valuable resources, especially
for the countries where land water availability
is very difficult and costly. Icebergs, another
source of fresh water, would be found by some
mechanism to the areas where water is needed
like Saudi Arabia, California, Australia, etc.
Ocean water is neither fit for human
consumption nor for agricultural purposes. But,
it can be converted into fresh water through
desalination. The important methods of
desalination are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Solar Still: In this process, the sea water
is boiled by concentrating solar heat
and then condensing the steam as fresh
water. In India, in Avnea village of
Gujarat, such a plant has been
established with the capacity of 5000
litres per day.</li>
        <li>Electrodialysis: In this method, ironreflective membrane is used for the
desalination of brackish water.</li>
        <li>Flash Distillation: Here, the heated
saline water is passed through a series
of chambers. In each section, vapour is
released and collected, and then
condensed.</li>
        <li>Reverse Osmosis: In this process,
suitable osmotic membranes are used
which rejects salt and allow water to
pass through it when the sea water is
put under high pressure.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

However, there are some problems regarding
the desalination processes. It is very costly and
needs huge amount of energy. The desalination
plants release significant amount of heat and
pollutants. There would be problem of the
disposal of vast amount of salt.
In India, Central Salt and Marine Chemical
Research Institute (CSMCRI) at Bhavnagar
(Gujarat) has done much in this sector. BHEL is
manufacturing desalination plants of different
sizes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MINERAL RESOURCES</i></strong></div>

Oceans are the storehouse of valuable
minerals in the world. Mineral resources,
available in ocean, are of different kinds like
energy resources (oil, gas, and coal), metallic
minerals (manganese, iron, tin, etc.), chemicals
(salt of sodium and chlorine and bromine, etc.),
manganese nodules and polymetallic nodules
and others (coral, limestone etc).
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Chemicals: About 64 out of total 92
naturally occurring chemicals are
dissolved in sea-water, although, only a
few of them are commercially viable for
extraction. Sodium and chlorine are
most abundant, about 85% of the total
dissolved salts are found in the seas.
Magnesium and Bromine are other
chemical elements.</li>
        <li>Metals/Minerals: They include gold,
silver, zinc, uranium, thorium, etc. It is
claimed that metals can be hauled from
the sea at 50-70% of the cost of
launching as the sea ores are often
highly concentrated. However, not all
of them are so available and with the
present status of technology they are
costly to extract. On the basis of areas
of availability, the mineral resources can
be again divided in the following way:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>On Continental Shelf and Slopes: This
zone is rich in zircon, monazite, magnetite,
gold, diamond, platinum, phosphorite,
sulphur, etc. Mud and sands found on the
continental shelf are rich in copper, zinc,
lead and calcium. Sand is a source of
calcium carbonate. Phosphorite is found in
the form of nodules containing about 30%
phosphate. On the western coast of India,
especially the Kerala coast, the sand of the
sea coast possess about 90% of world’s
monazite reserve, which is the chief nuclear
energy resource for the future. Along with
magnetite, zircon and rutile are also found
on the west coast of India and is viable for
extraction.</li>
        <li>Sub-surface Deposits: The most important
sub-surface deposits are mineral oil and
gases and coal. At present, about 90% of
the mineral value is taken from the sea.
The mineral oil deposits are mostly found
in the continental shelves. There are many
structures, which work as a trap for
petroleum and natural gas, such as, salt
dome. Thick sediment deposit and relatively
high concentration of organic matter suggest
to the occurrence of petroleum. Submerged
coal deposits are found in Japan, U.K and
South Africa.</li>
        <li>Deep Sea Deposits: There are two main
types of mineral deposits found on the deep
sea bed which are economically viable. They
are manganese nodules and metalliferous
sediments of polymetallic sulphides.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
        <li>Manganese Nodules: These nodules are
most abundant in the deepest part of the
ocean, very often in trenches. They are
hydrogenous pelagic deposits and found in
large concentration in red clay. They mainly
contain manganese, iron, nickel, copper,
cobalt, lead and zinc. They are mainly
spherical in shape from one to twenty cm
in diameter. About 25% of the sea floor is
expected to be covered by these deposits. In
Indian Ocean, over 10 million sq. km. area,
east of central Indian ridge has such
potential. They are less expensive source of
these metals. Again, they will be less
polluting than mining on land. They are
also good absorber of sulphur dioxide so
will further reduce pollution. But, the main
obstacle in their exploration is that they
need proper mining technology and huge
energy.</li>
        <li>Polymetallic Sulphides: Polymetallic
nodules are potato shaped, porous and
black earthy deposits, with size ranging
from 2 to 10 cm in diameter. These nodules
occur at nearly 4 to 5 km depth in the
deep oceans lying on the seabed. They
comprise, besides manganese and iron,
nickel, copper, cobalt, lead, molybdenum,
cadmium, vanadium, titanium.
They are less well known than manganese
nodules because their potential economic
importance has only recently been recognized.
They are rich in sulphur, iron, copper and smaller
amount of zinc, tin, molybdenum, lead and
silver. India has located such nodules in central
Indian Ocean and initiated the exploration of
polymetallic nodules in 1977 with the help of
Research ship-Gaveshani. India has tied up with
USA, UK, Russia, Japan and Germany in this
field. India presently has 75000 sq km area in
the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) for
developmental activities targeted at harnessing
of metals, viz. Copper, Nickel, and Cobalt.</li>
        <li>Hydrothermal Sulphides: Recently, a
major multi-disciplinary project aimed at
exploration for potential sites of
hydrothermal multimetal sulphide
mineralization in the Indian Ocean Ridge
areas has been initiated. The major
objectives are as under:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploration for potential sites of
hydrothermal multimetal sulphide
mineralization in the Indian Ocean Ridge
areas.</li>
        <li>Identification of locales of hydrothermal
sulphide deposition, including
determination of the resource potential.</li>
        <li>Initiation of associated scientific research
in the frontier areas of hydrothermal
mineralization.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Geotraces in India</i></strong></div>

A network of research projects being
executed by a number of research and academic
institutions. The objective is to map the
distribution of trace elements and isotopes in the
Indian Ocean and to identify the factors
influencing these distributions. The activities are
various stages of implementation and currently
involved in acquisition and analysis of samples.
One Oceangraphic cruise onboard Sagar
Sampada was conducted in the Arabian Sea.
Samples from several water profiles were
collected along 680 E transect for analysis of trace
elements and their isotopes in sediments and
corals of the northern Indian Ocean.
Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) play
important role in the ocean as nutrients and as
tracers of the contemporary and the past
processes. Trace elements regulate ocean
processes, such as marine ecosystem dynamics
and carbon cycling. Several other trace elements
also play vital roles in cell physiology and in
biochemical reactions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ENERGY RESOURCES</i></strong></div>

Almost all concepts and laws of science are
the subjects related to development to improve
the quality of life of our people. Science has made
it possible for man to alter his living and working
conditions and by doing so it is the society, which
derives its benefit. Science provides new tools to
society to enlarge and intensify its scope for the
exploitation of resources and to use them to
improve the socio-economic conditions of the
people.
<br>
<br>
Evidently there are several scientific
discoveries, which give us clues for their use in
serving the needs of society. Since ancient times,
oceans have served mankind in countless ways.
The seas around India constitute a natural
frontier of our country. Since times immemorial
the inhabitants of India have used the seas for
transport and communication for trade and
food. Recent developments in the field of
oceanography have convinced that some of the
biggest treasures of the world lie hidden in the
sea. Oceans are, therefore, known as “our last
frontier”.
<br>
<br>
Energy from Oceans: There are at least eight
sources of energy to be obtained from the sea.
The various methods of extracting energy are
from:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Ocean waves</li>
        <li>Ocean tides</li>
        <li>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)</li>
        <li>Ocean currents</li>
        <li>Ocean winds</li>
        <li>Salinity gradient</li>
        <li>Ocean geothermal</li>
        <li>Bioconversion of seaweeds</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<b>Ocean Waves:</b> Ocean water is kept under
constant motion by the waves, which are seen
at the surface. This continual motion can be
harnessed to produce energy. The vertical rise
and fall of successive waves is used to activate
either a water operated or air-operated turbine.
In many designs the air-operated turbine is being
preferred. An Oscillating Water Column (OWC)
is built or fabricated in steel with an inlet at the
bottom for the entry and exit of the waves. With
the incoming wave the water-column rises
pushing the air at the top which is forced
upwards to rotate a turbine and with the
outgoing waves the water column goes down
allowing the air to be sucked in rotating the
turbine in the same direction to generate power.
The stronger wave action, and the wave height,
the greater would be the power generated.
Our country, using the above method (OWC)
has designed a wave energy plant, which is being
built in Kerala. The ocean engineering centre of
the IIT, Chennai after several years of
painstaking efforts has been able to develop an
indigenous design. After the wave energy plant
is commissioned it would be the first of its kind
in the world.
<br>
<b>Ocean Tides:</b> It is the most popular and
feasible method of producing power. The regular
flow and ebb tides (high and low water) are
produced by astronomical gravitational forces
of the sun and the moon. If the differences
between the high and the low tide is large and if
either a natural or an artificial water storage
facility (reservoir) is available, power can be
produced. The incoming tide is allowed to flow
into the reservoir through a dam provided with
turbines to generate power. Similarly, the
outgoing tide is again made to flow through the
same dam to turn the turbine for generating
power. Such tidal power stations are built in
areas where the tidal range is large. In France, a
tidal power plant has been operating in the La
Rance estuary for a long time. The plant was
commissioned in 1980 and produces 230 mw of
power. Another tidal power plant is in operation
at Kislaya Guba in the Barents Sea. Tidal power
plants are being designed in the Bay of Fundy,
Canada, Severn estuary in U.K. and in the Bay
of Cambay and Kutch in India where tides have
been found to be of the right range.
<br>
<b>Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC)
Plant:</b> In tropical waters we find warm water at
the surface and cold water in deeper layers. The
difference between the two within 100 m depth
could be about 20°C or more. If such a situation
exists it is possible to conceive Ocean Thermal
Energy Conversion (OTEC) plant. The sun heats
the ocean and its energy gets stored in the
topmost layers leaving the water of deeper layers
cold. The principle of an OTEC plant is simple.
A “working fluid” like ammonia or propane
with a low boiling point is pumped into a closed
tube exposed to warm water. The heat of the
warm water vaporizes the working fluid; this
vapour is then taken to the cold water zone
where it condenses to give back the fluid in liquid
form. If this vapour is allowed to pass through a
turbine it can turn to generate power. The
vapour is allowed to pass through a condenser
in the cold water zone to get the liquid
condensed. Thus we need heat exchangers
(evaporator and condenser) with a turbine and
electrical generator in the middle. The working
fluid is pumped up and made to circulate.
The entire system can be built on the shore
with two tubes, one small to pump warm water
from the surface and the other long to pump cold
water from deeper parts to get the cycle
established.
<br>
<b>Ocean Currents:</b> Sweeping all along the
coastline are the ocean currents. There are a
number of designs available to convert the
energy of the fast moving current into electrical
power by allowing the water to pass through a
series of turbines installed under water. The main
problem of harnessing the energy from the
currents is their low energy density with
considerable risk in maintaining these structures
in position.
<br>
<b>Ocean Winds:</b> Coastal areas normally have
stronger winds and therefore, much more energy
is available from wind. Also in contrast to gusty
nature of wind found on land the variation in
wind speed is far smoother along the coast.
Suitable designs are available for windmills with
Battery bank systems for storing power. In
several countries, such systems have been
installed along the coast and on offshore
structures operating away from the coast.
Meteorological data show that the average speed
of wind in the world in the lower atmosphere is
about 10 m/s. The density of air being 1.1 kgm3
the available wind power is of the order of
approximately 500 W/m3
of the collected flow.
<br>
<br>
Steadiest winds are found in the trade wind zone.
Icing and hurricanes are some of the problems
associated with the trade wind zone to be solved
before power generation on a large scale, could
begin.
<br>
<b>Salinity Gradient:</b> The principle for tapping
energy, from salinity differences is simple. If
there are two water bodies with different
salinities available these are kept under
controlled conditions and if a semi-permeable
membrane is placed between them the water
with a lower salinity begins to flow through the
barrier until both attain equal concentrations.
This is based on the principle of osmosis and the
movement of ions can cause the electrical
current. Salinity power uses the concentration
gradients of salts in the sea to generate power.
In Sweden a pilot study is being conducted to
generate power of 200 MW.
<br>
<b>Ocean Geothermal:</b> This source has a very
limited value at present. There are many regions
of the earth where the temperature is higher as
we go deeper into the earth’s crust. Certain areas
of the ocean contain hot spring with temperature
as high as 50°C and from such a temperature
difference it is possible to extract energy. The
geothermal situation is the reverse of the ocean
thermal energy conversion (OTEC). In the former
case, the temperature is low at the surface of the
sea bottom but high as we go deeper into the
earth crust and in latter case it is high at the
surface of the sea and low at deeper layers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>OCEAN DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

India has more than 7500 km long coastline
including the islands and about 2 million sq.km
of Exclusive Economic Zone. Since it has been
visualized that ocean has the vast potential of
endless economic resources, various steps have
been taken to develop and exploit its resources.
First of all, multidimensional ocean research ship
‘Gaveshani’ was employed in this field in 1975.
After that in 1979 Ocean Science and Technology
Authority was set up in order to probe India’s
potential in the field of ocean research and
development. However, the landmark step was
taken in 1981 when the Department of Ocean
Development was set up. Two research vessels,
Sagar Kanya from Germany and Sagar Sampada
from Denmark, were engaged in the field of
ocean research and development in the year
1983 and 1984, respectively. A fleet of six
scientific research vessels are under operation in
2012-13 for undertaking oceanographic research
activities. These are: ORV Sagar Kanya, FORV
Sagar Sampada, TDV Sagar Nidhi, BTV Sagar
Manjusha, CRV Sagar Paschimi and CRV Sagar
Purvi.
<br>
<br>
The main objectives of Ocean Development
in India are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploration and assessment of marine
living and non-living resources. Sagar
Kanya and Sagar Sampada have done
a lot in this area.</li>
        <li>Deep sea-bed exploration, especially of
polymetallic nodules. The commercial
exploitation of 6 elements-sodium,
calcium, chlorine, bromine, magnesium
and sulphur is possible from the seabed. The prominent institutions engaged
in the exploration of deep sea-bed are
National Institute of Oceanography,
Goa; Central Mechanical Engineering
Institute, Durgapur; National
Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur;
RRL, Bhuvaneshwar; and HZL,
Udaipur.</li>
        <li>Antarctica Expedition is another aspect
of ocean development which was
started in 1981. Antarctic Study Centre,
Goa is the nodal agency to regulate the
different expedition. Indian scientists
have already established three
permanent stations-Maitri, Dakshin
Gangotri and Bharati in Antarctica.</li>
        <li>Development of coastal zone and
islands. It is an integrated approach
which covers the overall development
of the coastal area. Five centres of
marine satellite information services
have been set up to gather the
information. For pollution control
Coastal Ocean Monitoring and
Prediction System has been established.
Some other steps taken for the
development of the coast are the Wave
Energy Development Programme, Sea
Level Monitoring and Modeling,
International Geosphere-Biosphere
Programme.</li>
        <li>Oceanic-Meteorological survey is the
prime goal of ocean development, which
is of significant use in weather
forecasting.</li>
        <li>Useful role in marine science and
technology in the international arena is
also an important objective as declared
in the “Ocean Policy Statement-1982”.
The Ocean Policy Statement is primarily
aimed at utilisation of marine living and
nonliving resources for societal benefits
in a sustainable manner.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In India, the Department of Ocean
Development carries out a periodic monitoring
of the marine habitat. Started in 1991, the coastal
ocean monitoring and prediction system
(COMAPS) collects information on 25
parameters from 77 locations in the country, with
the assistance of 11 Research and Development
Organizations.
<br>
<br>
The UNESCO had declared 1998 as the
International Year of the Ocean and chalked out
a host of ambitious plans and programmes. The
International Oceanographic Commission (IOC),
an independent body in the UNESCO family,
was the nodal agency for the co-ordination of
world-wide activities planned for the
International Year of the Ocean. The main aims
of the International Year were to raise awareness
of the oceans and coastal areas as economical
assets, to obtain commitments from governments
to take actions, etc. As part of the International
Year of the Ocean, DOD proposed to display its
research ship “Sagar Kanya” for a study of the
characteristics of the aerosol over the oceanic
regions and their optical effects. The Indian
satellite Oceansat and INSAT-3D are totally
dedicated to ocean related services.
Considering the need for capacity building
and specialised skilled human resources as
emphasised in the Ocean Policy Statement,
Department of Ocean Development has
established national institutes, viz. National
Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) at
Chennai, National Centre for Antarctic and
Ocean Research (NCAOR) at Goa, Indian
National Centre for Ocean and Information
Services (INCOIS) at Hyderabad, Project
Directorate, Integrated Coastal and Marine Area
Management (PD-ICMAM) at Chennai and
Centre for Marine Living Resources and Ecology
(CMLRE) at Kochi.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ANTARCTIC RESEARCH</i></strong></div>

In March 2012, India successfully
commenced operations at Bharati, the third
permanent station in the Antarctica. The
summer complement of the 31st Indian Scientific
Expedition to Antarctica returned from
Antarctica after completion of targeted activities.
During the 6th expedition to the Southern
Ocean 2011-12, continuous observations were
carried out for ocean currents, atmospheric
parameters and biogeochemistry by operating
various instruments.
<br>
<br>
India entered in the field of Antarctic
research with its first expedition ‘Operation
Gangotri’ in December 1981. The third
expedition constructed the permanent scientific
research station ‘Dakshin Gangotri’ in 1983-84.
The second research station ‘Maitri’ was set up
in 1988-89. The various scientific programmes
of Antarctic Research included studies in the
field of meteorology, radio-wave-propagation,
geology, Geophysics, Oceanography, Marine
biology, Microbiology, upper atmosphere
chemistry, Glaciology, etc. India was admitted
as a consultative member of Antarctic treaty in
1959. In September 1983, India became a
member of the scientific committee on Antarctic
Research. India acceded to the convention on
the conservation of Antarctic Marine Living
Resources from July 17, 1985 and became full
time member of the Commission from September
1986.
<br>
<br>
Antarctica is the seventh continent of the
world. It covers about 14 million sq. km area with
about 5, 12,000 sq. km ice-free area. Up to
seventh decade of 20th century, this was
considered as an abandoned area for mankind,
but after the discovery of ozone hole in
Antarctica, this abandoned region was
visualized with great importance and at the same
time other useful areas were discovered.
Antarctica is rich in biological resources. Seals,
more than 40 species of birds, fungi, algae,
grasses, penguins, etc., are found here. Krill of
Antarctica is one of the most famous and
abundant resource of the world with the
estimated stock of 1000 million metric tonnes of
which at least 40-50 million metric tonnes could
be harvested annually without endangering the
stock. Antarctica ice cap contains 70% of world’s
fresh water store and more than 90% of ice. The
ice-free region of Antarctica has been visualized
as having large scale mineral deposits. And this
region is probably the world’s biggest coal-field.
The Indian Antarctic Research Programme
has been designed to take advantage of the
unique site and environment of Antarctica
towards understanding the key global processes
that govern our future well being. The scientific
programmes are essentially part of it and rooted
in the following long-term programmes:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Ice-Ocean-atmosphere system in
Antarctica and global environment.</li>
        <li>Antarctic lithosphere and Gondwanaland reconstruction framework for
delineating plate tectonic processes and
assessment of mineral resources and
hydrocarbons.</li>
        <li>Antarctic ecosystem and environmental
physiology.</li>
        <li>Solar terrestrial processes.</li>
        <li>Innovative technologies for support
systems.</li>
        <li>Environmental impact assessment.</li>
        <li>Generation and structuring of data
bases-geological, topographic, thematic
mapping and ecosystem changes,
environmental parameter, health care,
etc.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The purpose of the Indian Antarctic research
is to identify and initiate studies and
programmes, which are of significance in
scientific and economic terms and to establish
infrastructure facility and expertise which
would enable India to sustain and expand its
activities. Furthermore, it would add to our
knowledge of the various features related to the
Indian Ocean and also to the weather related to
monsoon. Antarctica is also crucial to global
weather phenomena, such as, air circulation
pattern, the cold phases and the sea currents.
India hosted and chaired the meeting Asian
Forum for Polar Sciences in New Delhi on 6-7
August 2012. China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia
and host India participated in the meeting and
exchanged information on the activities carried
out in the Antarctic, Arctic and Southern Ocean.
India won the bid for hosting the Scientific
Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR) – XII
International Symposium on Antarctic Earth
Sciences, in 2015 at Goa.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>31st INDIAN SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION</i></strong></div>

The 31st Indian Scientific Expedition to
Antarctica was launched in October 2011 and
culminated in March 2012 with the
commissioning of India’s Third Antarctic Station
“Bharati” on 18th March 2012.
Some of the major projects implemented by
the Indian Scientists at Maitri and Bharati during
the summer and winter months of 2011-12
comprise: ionospheric studies by the National
Physical laboratory, Temporal and Spatial
Variations of meteorological parameters, by
Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment
(SASE), Meteorological parameter observations
by ESSO IMD, Geophysical Studies by the
Indian Institute of Geomagnetism and National
Geophysical Research Institute, Hydrographic
Surveys by the National Hydrographic Office,
Glaciological Studies by the Geological Survey
of India and Geochemical and petrological
studies of lamprophyres of Central Dronning
Maud Land (CDML), by Nagpur University.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>32nd INDIAN SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION</i></strong></div>

The 32nd Indian Scientific Expedition to
Antarctica (2012-13), was launched in
November 2012 from Cape Town. The major
activity includes construction of seawater intake
facility and an earth station to receive remote
sensing data at Bharati. In view of the mammoth
tasks ahead, a logistic team of 40 members
comprising doctors, engineers, mechanics and
technicians has been working at Bharati
presently.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ARCTIC MISSION OF INDIA</i></strong></div>

Taking advantage of the unique International
Svalbard Treaty signed in 1920, to which it was
a signatory, India will be able to set up a
permanent research station at Ny Alesund, on
the Svalbard archipelago which comes under
Norwegian sovereignty, boosting its knowledge
of climate change, other critical natural
phenomena and the disturbance of humans
cause to nature’s processes. India has already
sent 26 missions to the Antarctic and has two
permanent bases there, the research base at 79
degree north will be set up under a five-year
contract with the Norwegian government and
Kings Bay, the Norwegian government-held
company that runs the logistics at the research
station.
<br>
<br>
The Svalbard Treaty allows every signatory
country that includes Afghanistan, to set up any
business and activity on the archipelago - which
was earlier better known for its coal mining
industry - as long as it falls within Norwegian
regulations. Formal negotiations between the
two countries are close to completion for India
to take position close to the North Pole. The move
to set up a permanent station at Ny Alesund
matured with India sending its first Arctic
mission. Three of the five researchers sent as part
of the first of the two teams comprising the
mission have already made themselves at home
at the international research station.
The second Arctic expedition of the country
was launched in two batches viz. First Summer
batch (June-July 2008) and Second Summer
batch (July-August 2008). During the second
Arctic expedition, India established a research
station at Arctic named 'Himadri' at Ny-Alesund
in Svalbard region of Norway. The 3rd Indian
Arctic Expedition has been launched in three
phases (June-July 2009, August 2009 and MarchApril 2010).
The summer phase I of the Indian Arctic
Programme was completed between June – July
2012. The studies on (i) Long term monitoring
of the Kongsfjorden system of the Arctic region
for climate change studies and (ii) Quantifying
variability in freshwater influx to the
Kongsfjorden system using oxygen isotopes of
seawater and the implications to the ice melting
have been undertaken.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GEO-STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF INDIAN OCEAN</i></strong></div>

Indian Ocean is the third largest ocean of the
world. It covers 20.7 per cent ocean area which
is 7.5 crore sq. km. It is the only ocean named
after a country, indicating India’s association
with this vast water-body since the dawn of
human civilization. India lies at the apex of the
triangular water-body and has rightly been
called ‘the crown of the ocean’. India covers
about 1/8th coastline of the ocean. The ocean is
bordered by 46 littoral and island sovereign
States. India is not only the largest in area just
after Australia, but alone has more than 50 per
cent population of the region. Circled on the
north by India and Arab countries, in the west
by Africa, east by Malaysia, Indonesia, etc. and
south by Antarctica, it is an ‘embayed ocean’ or
landlocked sea.
<br>
<br>
It was not until 1500 AD that the real
importance of this centrally-located ocean was
recognized. The Portuguese were the first to
understand the military importance of this ocean
and within 17 years of the arrival of Vasco-deGama, they were in the commanding position.
They took command of Malabar region for reexport of East Indian spices, and Goa became
their capital. Besides Goa, Daman and Diu,
Portuguese base were made at Madras, Hooghly,
Chittagong and Ceylon. But, the fall of the Strait
of Malacca to the Dutch in 1595 led to the
collapse of the Portuguese defence system. By
that time, British and French presence was also
felt.
<br>
<br>
The Britishers dominated Indian Ocean
during their rule over India. But after World
War-II, British Government started gradually
reducing its presence in the ocean zone due to
declining interest. British Government decided
to withdraw all the bases by 1971. The most
important decision was the selling of Diego
Garcia to U.K. by Mauritius and then to U.S.A.
on a contract by U.K. for communication
purpose. But, Diego-Garcia has now been
converted into a military base in the Indian
Ocean.

    <ul>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Induced changes of Sea Level</i></strong></div>    
        
There is a likelihood of an accelerated rate of
sea level rise in the present century as a result of
culturally induced global climatic change,
specially the global warming. Many scientists
expect a rise of up to 60 cm by the year 2050, up
to 1m. by 2100 and up to several metres by 2200.
Environmental change on such a scale would
be without precedent and the impacts would be
serious.
<br>
<br>
The projected sea level change in the near
future caused by global warming will have an
effect on shrinkage of the land area and the
wiping out of some islands because of drowning.
There are many possible impacts of such rise.
These include:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Damage to many important coastal
ecosystems, including deltas, coral atolls
and reefs;</li>
        <li>Flooding of many densely populated
areas;</li>
        <li>Damage to port facilities and coastal
structures;</li>
        <li>Severe coastal erosion in many countries,
including loss of beaches and dunes;</li>
        <li>Salinization of many important ground
water resources through salt water
intrusion;</li>
        <li>Decline of loss of production in up to onethird of the world’s croplands.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Scientists accept that some global increase in
sea level is now inevitable, but they stress that
rate and extent of change depends on what
action is taken by society today. Important
decisions will have to be protected with dykes
and embankments, like the Thames Barrier.
Already rising sea level is causing serious
ecological problems in some parts of the Pacific
Ocean. The Cartel Islands, one of the most
densely populated coral atolls in the Pacific, lie
to the north-east of Papua New Guinea and they
are experiencing problems that prevent the
inhabitants from supporting themselves from
their own resources.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Marine Pollution</i></strong></div>
            
Pollution of environment especially marine
pollution is a worldwide phenomenon. Oil spills
and conspicuous acts of dumping hazardous
wastes e.g. radioactive material at sea have
attracted greater attention in recent years to the
dangers of oceanic pollution. Some of the major
marine pollutants are mercury, lead, pesticides,
petroleum, radioactive elements, etc.
Most of the marine pollutants originate on
the continent and reach the oceans via the
atmosphere and rivers. Oceanic pollution cannot
be controlled unless the releases of the materials
that pollute the oceans are controlled. Shipping
accounts for only 10 per cent while pollution
from land-based sources account for 70-75 per
cent of all marine pollution. As per the
observations of United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), some 70 per cent of the
waste discharged into the Pacific Ocean receives
no treatment. About half of the countries in West
Asia have an oil-based economy which has given
some countries the resources to develop an
extremely intensive agriculture which has led to
the pollution of the food chain and of rivers and
marine seas.
<br>
<br>
A serious form of marine pollution is the
introduction of non-indigenous species through
ballast water. This is sea water that is taken on
board, for example at the outset of voyage, in
order to stabilize a ship and its cargo. Once at
destination, this water-and all the bacteria,
viruses and organisms it contains-is released.
This is a big problem for Australia. Apparently,
organisms used to cold water cannot survive in
the tropics and vice versa. Similarly every year
million tonnes of fish are thrown back, dead,
because they are inedible, unwanted or too small
to be marketed.
<br>
<br>
However, the problem of regular oil spill has
been a subject of debate worldwide in
the recent past. The importance of
controlling oil pollution at sea lies not
only in its short-term effects but also
the long-terms effects on marine life and
environment. There are many shortterm effects of the oil-spill. Shore
properties and beaches can be
extensively contaminated. Slow moving
crustaceans and inter-tidal marine life
can be physically damaged by heavy
spills of oil. The oil-film forms a barrier
to the transfer of oxygen into the water
to support marine life. The long-term
effects of oil pollution are two-fold. Once
incorporated into a particular marine
organism, hydrocarbons are stable and
pass through many members of the
marine food chain without alteration
eventually reaching organisms that are
harvested for human consumption.
Another effect results from the low level
interference of oil pollution with marine
ecology. Oil pollution interferes with
natural processes by plugging taste
receptors and distorting natural stimuli
which may threaten some marine
species.</li>

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Corals in Danger</i></strong></div>    
        
Global climate change, or the enhanced
greenhouse effect, may cause increase in sea
temperature and sea level, as well as changes in
ocean current patterns, that could damage coral
reefs. For example, corals are very sensitive to
changes in temperature. Sea-water that becomes
too warm causes corals to turn white, or bleach,
a reaction that occurs if coral polyps are stressed.
Often they recover, but they are also known to
die. If the oceans warm up as a result of global
climate change, corals may have increasing
difficulty recovering from bleaching episodes.
Coral reefs are being over-exploited on a global
basis. It is increasingly difficult to make a living
from fishing, as first the big, commercially
valuable species such as groupers disappear, and
then the smaller ones. Often damaging
harvesting methods such as poisons and
dynamite are used. Overfishing tends to be
followed by a change in the ecological balance
of the reef. For example, it becomes overgrown
with algae if grazing species are removed. Corals
and shells are collected all over the world to sell
as souvenirs or to make into jewellery and other
handicrafts.</li>
