<h3>India In Space</h3>

Man’s evolution and progress are closely
linked with how efficiently he stores and
disseminates information. The Vedas were
handed down by word of mouth. The invention
of writing extended communication beyond the
reach of the spoken word. Thereafter, the
invention of the printing press by Johann
Gutenburg in 1455 brought about a major
change in the life style of the human race. The
discovery of radio waves in 1888 by Hertz
resulted in radio broadcasting, which cut across
the limits of time and space. The next
breakthrough in information dissemination
came in 1945 with the prediction by Arthur C
Clarke, a British scientist and science fiction
writer about the feasibility of global
communications (including TV) by using man
made artificial satellites.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BRIEF HISTORY</i></strong></div>

Space research has always been a challenge
for both man and science. The initial emphasis
was on exploration of the unknown celestial
bodies and development of space probes and
related systems. But, gradually space
applications became very important in a wide
range of areas. The region beyond the Earth’s
tangible atmosphere-160 km from the surfacefirst became accessible to man when ‘Sputnik-I’
was put into orbit by the erstwhile USSR in
October 1957. In ‘Sputnik- II’, launched by
Russia, a dog Laika was sent in the space. The
physiological examination of Laika revealed that
human beings might also survive prolonged
period in space. In January 1958, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
of USA launched ‘Explorer-I’ satellite in space.
The major contribution of Explorer-I mission was
the discovery of the Van Allen radiation belts
around the Earth where electrons and protons
from the sun are trapped by the Earth’s magnetic
field. Far side of the Moon’s glimpse in the history
of mankind was observed from the Russian
satellite ‘Luna- III’ in October 1959. April 2, 1961
was a landmark in history when the first ever
manned spacecraft, ‘Vostok - I’, was injected in
space and a Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin
became the first person to travel in space. On
June 16, 1963 Valentina Tereshkova, a Russian
cosmonaut was registered as the first woman in
the world to travel in the space and to stay in
orbit for up to five days through the ‘Vostok-VI’
spacecraft.
<br>
<br>
In 1960s, the space science widened its
nature and scope. Now the space scientists
concentrated their studies around the
exploration of other celestial bodies like the
Moon, Venus and Mars. The US ‘Mariner-II’ in
1962 flew past the planet Venus and calculated
its temperature and its reverse direction of
rotation. In 1965 ‘Mariner-IV’ sent back clear
photographs indicating craters on Mars.
American astronauts made more modest flights
in their smaller Mercury spacecraft. In 1965,
USA launched the Gemini-series programme for
the preparation of Apollo mission to the Moon.
On December 21, 1968 a landmark in history
was created when the first manned voyage to
the Moon took place by an American spacecraft
‘Apollo-8’, which orbited the Moon 10 times and
returned safely to the Earth. July 21, 1969 was a
memorable day in space history when four
legged Lunar Module of ‘Apollo-11’ landed on
the surface of the Moon along with US astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin.
In 1970s, space scientists developed the
capability to establish permanent space
exploration centre and established the Skylab &
Salyut space stations.
<br>
<br>
In 1977, the first shuttle ‘Enterprises’, which
was a modified form of 747 jumbo jet along with
a rocket launcher, was injected into space by
NASA. The shuttle carried the orbiter into the
air and back on several flights and released it in
mid-air. The shuttle’s first orbital mission began
on April 12, 1981 when ‘Columbia’ was
launched. In June 18, 1983 the shuttle
‘Challenger’ was sent into space which took Sally
Ride, the first US-women to space. In April, 1984
the major achievement in space technology was
created when the satellite Solar Max was
successfully repaired and the astronauts walked
in space for as long as 6 hours and 44 minutes.
In March 1989, the space shuttle ‘Atlantis’
launched a spacecraft on the voyage to Venus.
In October 1990, the US shuttle ‘Discovery’ again
launched the scientific spacecraft ‘Ulysses’ into
space in order to probe the polar region of the
Sun.
In February 1986, a major landmark in space
history was achieved when the third generation
space laboratory ‘Mir’ was launched into space.
The Soviet Union joined the era of space shuttles
in November 1988, when its first reusable shuttle
‘Buran’ was launched on the world’s most
powerful booster rocket ‘Energia’.
The Ulysses space mission, undertaken
jointly by the European Space Agency and
NASA was launched in October 1990 to explore
regions of space above the poles of the Sun.
Observations made by the spacecraft have led
to several major discoveries concerning the
physical properties of the region and, thus, have
contributed to a better understanding of the solar
atmosphere. Of particular importance are the
discoveries on the structure of the space medium
in the helioshpere and its properties; nature and
region of solar wind and the access of cosmic
rays into the solar system. Sudden changes in
the solar winds cause large disturbances in
Earth’s magnetic field. Ulysses was also expected
to resolve doubts over origin of solar activity
cycle. The cycle initiates changes in solar winds,
solar atmosphere, etc.
<br>
<br>
Another monumental contribution by
Arthur Clark which has had far reaching
implication was the idea of a Geo-synchronous
Earth Orbit (GEO)‘ a belt’ approximately 36800
km over the equator. A satellite placed exactly
in the ‘Clark orbit’ appears stationary to any
observer on the earth.
Theoretically three satellites placed 120
degrees apart are sufficient to provide global
coverage for all types of information, including
T.V. Such a system which requires minimum
infrastructure on the ground became a reality in
1963 with the launching of SYNOCOM III
(synchronous communication satellite).
Commercial exploitation of satellite broadcasting
started in 1964-65 with the formation of
INTELSAT, a global consortium of over 125
countries each becoming a shareholder in the
space segment, consisting of satellites in 
the geosynchronous orbit over the Indian, Atlantic and
Pacific oceans to cover the entire globe. The
“ground segment” consisting of ground stations
to operate with the INTELSAT satellites was the
responsibility of each member country. In India
and the Commonwealth nations, this agency is
a government department or a corporation. India
became a founder member of INTELSAT in 1965
and got ready to set up its own ground station
at Arvi near Pune.
<br>
<br>
Theoretically 32 satellites can be
accommodated with a 50 degree separation in
the GEO. However all these 32 slots or parking
lots are not suitable since they lie over oceans or
uninhabited landmasses. Satellite communications are very much more energy efficient than
short wave radio and when first introduced it
was expected to be a panacea for all the ills
affecting long distance communications.
Satellite based communication is now being
used for long range mobile stations like ships,
boats, aircrafts, railways and road transports
where the cellular radios cannot meet the
demand. In fact, in many instances, satellite
technology is the only means to provide a chance
to get reliable and effective communication
between fixed site and remote mobile vehicles.
The International Maritime Satellite
Organisation (IMNARSAT) has been providing
real time communication services, including TV
broadcasting and emergency and rescue services
to ships at sea since 1982. Management of mobile
fleets whether at sea or in the air or on the
ground, by real time positioning from one central
location, is a very exciting prospect in the not
too distant future. GEOSTAR of USA is one such
system.
<br>
<br>
Satellite communication involves three main
systems the satellite, the rocket and the launch
facility to place it in orbit, and the ground
segment to transmit and receive data. Only a few
countries own all the three because their
development involves enormous resources and
the manpower of thousands of scientists and
engineers.
Satellites offer a solution to the overcrowding
of the entirely earth based channels of
communication. A satellite at a distance of
hundreds or thousands of miles above the earth
has a considerable area of the earth’s surface in
its line of sight and therefore, they can relay
signals from one earth based station to another.
There are two methods by which this relaying
may be effected. Some satellites merely reflect
the signals and are therefore known as passive
satellites. Others receive and retransmit them and
are known as active satellites. Also
communication satellites may be classified
according to their orbits as sun-synchronous and
geo-synchronous.
<br>
<br>
The area of the earth within the line of sight
of satellites that orbit close to earth obviously is
not as wide as that of satellites at greater heights.
So satellites are placed at a lower height. Spacing
of satellites, signals would still need to be
transformed frequently between satellites.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SPACE PROGRAMMES IN INDIA</i></strong></div>

The foundation of space research in India
was laid in 1961 when the Government of India
entrusted the task of developing a programme
on space research to its Department of Atomic
Energy. The Department of Atomic Energy set
up a National Committee which identified two
major objectives for India’s space research
programme. These objectives were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To utilise space technology for the rapid
development of Mass communication
and education, especially in the far-flung
rural areas,</li>
        <li>To utilise space technology for the
timely survey and management of the
country’s natural resources.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

After laying the foundation of space
research in India, it was realised that the vast
potential of space technology can be used for
the socio-economic development of the country
only by developing indigenous techniques for
placing a satellite in the Earth’s orbit. In order
to boost the technological efforts to make India
self-reliant in the field of space technology, a
Space Commission was set up in 1972 and a
separate Department of Space (DoS) was
established thereafter. The DoS executes its
space programmes through the Indian Space
Research Organisation (ISRO). The basic
requirements for attaining self-sufficiency in the
field of space technology may be summed up
as:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To develop expertise in planning,
designing and fabricating the satellites
or spacecrafts for various purposes;</li>
        <li>To develop suitable launch vehicles (i.e.,
rockets) which could place satellites in
Earth’s orbit;</li>
        <li>To establish ‘Earth Stations’ for
launching, tracking, controlling and
guiding the satellites;</li>
        <li>To develop ground facilities for using
space technology for mass
communication.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The Indian space programme has three thrust
areas:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Development of communication through
satellite;</li>
        <li>Development of remote sensing for
resource survey and management,
environmental monitoring and
meteorological services;</li>
        <li>Development of indigenous satellites, as
also their launching.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SPACE VISION INDIA 2025</i></strong></div>

A Space Vision 2025 was unveiled at the
Indian Science Congress-2003, in Bangalore. The
emphasis was on achieving self-reliance in
launching capabilities and end dependence on
foreign agencies for the same. Self-sufficiency
has been achieved in the fabrication of satellites.
Mission to moon also forms part of the Vision.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Satellite based communication and
navigation systems for rural connectivity,
security needs and mobile services.</li>
        <li>Enhanced imaging capability for natural
resource management, weather and
climate change studies.</li>
        <li>Space science missions for better
understanding of solar system and
universe Planetary exploration.</li>
        <li>Development of Heavy lift launcher.</li>
        <li>Reusable Launch Vehicles - Technology
demonstrator missions leading to Two
Stage To Orbit (TSTO).</li>
        <li>Human Space Flight.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INFRASTRUCTURE</i></strong></div>

The Space Commission’s tasks include
framing of policy, approval of space
programme budget and implementation of
national policy in all matters concerning outer
space.
<br>
<br>
Many organisations and research centres
have been established to carry out research and
developmental activities related to the various
segments of the space research programmes.
The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
is one such organisation. The various tasks
which have been assigned to ISRO are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To develop the know-how to fabricate
the rockets, its propellants, its control
and guidance systems;</li>
        <li>To design and fabricate the satellites.
Thus, ISRO is responsible for planning,
programming and management of research and
development activities in the country in space
science, technology and applications. The ISRO
council and ISRO headquarters provide overall
direction to the scientific, technological and
management tasks of the ISRO centres and units.
Research in space sciences is also supported in
several institutions by the multi-agency Indian
Middle Atmosphere Programme (IMAP) and the
Advisory Committee for Space Sciences
(ADCOS).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

ISRO also disseminates know-how to
industries to market the ‘spin offs’ of the national
space efforts. It also provides consultancy
services to the industrial and technology sectors
of the country, utilises the manpower and
infrastructure available with these sectors for its
space programmes. The know-how transferred
to industry includes chemicals, polymers, special
materials, instruments, telecommunications, TV
equipment, electronic sub-systems, electro-optic
hardware, computer software and special
purpose machines.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Endogenetic forces</i></strong></div>

The rocket programme in India began with
the establishment of the Thumba Equatorial
Rocket Launching Station (TERLS) in 1963 for
launching sounding rockets equipped with
instruments to conduct meteorological or
scientific observations. Initially, foreign rockets
were used and later on the Rohini Sounding
Rockets (RSR) were developed indigenously.
Currently being used is RH-200 which can lift a
payload of upto 50 kg for altitudes of 140-150
km, and RH-560 with payloads of 100 kg for
altitudes upto 350 km.
<br>
<br>
In the field of launch vehicle technology,
India has evolved a four-stage development
programme, i.e., SLV, ASLV, PSLV and GSLV.
Launch Vehicles are used to transport and
put satellites or spacecrafts into space. In India,
the launch vehicles development programme
began in the early 1970s. The first experimental
Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-3) was developed
in 1980. An Augmented version of this, ASLV,
was launched successfully in 1992. India has
made tremendous strides in launch vehicle
technology to achieve self-reliance in satellite
launch vehicle programme with the
operationalisation of Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle (PSLV) and Geosynchronous Satellite
Launch Vehicle (GSLV).
<br>
<br>
PSLV represents ISRO's first attempt to
design and develop an operational vehicle that
can be used to orbit application satellites. With
PSLV, a new world-class vehicle has arrived.
PSLV has repeatedly proved its reliability and
versatility by launching 63 satellites / spacecrafts
(28 Indian and 35 Foreign Satellites) into a
variety of orbits so far.
ISRO also makes the Rohini series of
sounding rockets used by the Indian and
international scientific community to launch
payloads to various altitudes for atmospheric
research and other scientific investigations. These
rockets are also used to qualify some of the
critical systems used for advanced launch
vehicles.
<br>
<br>
<b>Satellite Launch Vehicle-3:</b> India’s first
satellite launch vehicle was the SLV-3. The first
successful launch placed a 35 kg RS-1 satellite
into a low Earth orbit in July 1980. This was the
culmination of about seven years of
developmental effort. The next two launches of
SLV-3 took place in 1981 and 1983. The 22.7
metre long SLV-3 was a four stage solid
propellant vehicle with a launch weight of 17
tonnes.
<br>
<br>
In the first stage, the development of SLV-3
was a major achievement in India’s space
capability by placing the 40 kg Rohini satellite
into near Earth orbit of 300 Km. With the three
successful launching of SLV-3, India became the
sixth country in the world to have the capability
to orbit its own satellite.
<br>
<b>ASLV:</b> In the second stage of the launch
vehicle development programme, ASLV was
developed, which was basically a derived form
of SLV-3. It also used solid propellant in its all
four stages.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Augmented Satellite Launch Vehicle
(ASLV)</b> was designed to place a 150 kg satellite
(SROSS) into a 100-km orbit. This constitutes an
addition of two first stage rocket motors as 
strapons to the sides of the SLV-3 first stage. The heat
shield, which protects the satellite from the heat
generated as the vehicle speeds through the
dense atmosphere, has been made to
accommodate the large spacecraft. In addition,
a closed loop guidance system incorporating a
Stabilised Platform Inertial Navigation System
(SPINS) and a micro-processor based navigation
and guidance computer has replaced the open
loop guidance system used in the SLV-3 in order
to achieve a more accurate control of the
trajectory. Some of the other changes include a
change over to S-band frequencies from VHF to
comply with international regulations for radio
transmissions, use of KEVLAR fibre for the fourth
stage body in order to increase the payload
capability, etc. The lift-off weight of ASLV is 39
tonnes and its height being 23.5 metres.
<br>
<br>
<b>Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle:</b> The fourstage, 
275 tonnes, 15 storey tall (44 m) PSLV has
heralded a 4 new era in the country’s space
programme as the first rocket to use liquid
propellants in its two stages. Liquid propellants,
developed here itself, are the latest in space
technology.
<br>
<br>
In the third stage of launch vehicle
development programme, the concept of the use
of liquid propellant was taken in the form of
PSLV programme, which was approved in 1993.
PSLV series of launch vehicles have the capability
to inject the pay-load of 1000 kg polar satellites
in the orbit of 900 km. This was the first launch
vehicle in India, which used liquid propellant
along with solid propellants. PSLV is a four-stage
rocket, with a solid propellant motor and six
motors derived from SLV-3 strapped around it
in the first stage. The second stage based on
liquid engine technology uses liquid propellant,
while the third and fourth stages have solid and
liquid propellants, respectively.
The first stage of PSLV uses Hydroxyl
Terminated Poly Butadine (H.T.P.B.) as fuel and
Ammonium Perchlorate as oxidiser. The stage
uses world’s third largest booster motor made
of meraging steel. The second stage of PSLV uses
VIKAS engine, powered by liquid fuel
Unsymmetrical Dimethyl Hydrazine (UDMH)
and Nitrogen Tetroxide (N2O3) as oxidiser. The
third stage of PSLV uses HTPB-based solid
propellant. The motor of this stage is made of
Kevlar (i.e., polyaramide fibre). The fourth stage,
which finally injects the polar satellite into the
orbit, has twin-engine configuration. This stage
uses Monomethyl Hydrazine (MMH) as fuel and
the oxides of nitrogen as oxidiser.
The reliability rate of PSLV has been superb
— There had been 23 continuously successful
flights of PSLV, till July 2013. With its variant
configurations, PSLV has proved its multipayload, multi-mission capability in a single
launch and its geosynchronous launch
capability. In the Chandrayaan-mission, another
variant of PSLV with an extended version of
strap-on motors, PSOM-XL, the payload haul
was enhanced to 1750 kg in 620 km SSPO. PSLV
has rightfully earned the status of workhorse
launch vehicle of ISRO.
<br>
<br>
<b>PSLV-C22 Launched:</b> On July 01, 2013 Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle, in its twenty fourth
flight (PSLV-C22) launched India’s first
dedicated navigational satellite IRNSS-1A. The
launch took place from the First Launch Pad
(FLP) of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, (SDSC)
SHAR, Sriharikota. PSLV-C22 used ‘XL’ version
of PSLV. This is the fourth time such a
configuration has flown, earlier three being
PSLV-C11/ Chandrayaan-1, PSLV-C17/ GSAT12 and PSLV-C 19/ RISAT-1 missions.
GSLV: The fourth stage of the Indian Vehicle
Development Programme is the use of geostationary launch vehicles (GSLV). The use of
cryogenic engines is in the last stage of
experiment. Cryogenic engines use liquid
hydrogen as fuel at-2530C and liquid oxygen at830C as oxidiser.
<br>
<br>
The finally chosen GSLV design is a threestage vehicle, the core being a 125 tonne solid
booster as in PSLV with four liquid strap-ons of
Vikas engine, each with a propellant loading of
40 tonnes. The second stage of GSLV is the Vikas
liquid propulsion system as in PSLV and the last
upper stage, a 12 tonne restartable cryogenic
engine which uses liquid oxygen and liquid
hydrogen. The most interesting aspect of GSLV
is its modularity, which without strap-ons has
the same capability as PSLV, with two strap-ons
can launch over 1600 kg into a polar orbit and
with all the four strap-ons can launch 2.5 tonnes
into Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).
Excepting for the addition of a new cryo-stage,
the first two stages fully exploit PSLV pedigree.
With just three stages, GSLV should prove to be
a world class launch vehicle in terms of reliability,
cost competitiveness and payload fraction.
<br>
<br>
<b>GSLV Launch:</b> GSLV was test fired
successfully from SHAR on April 18, 2001. This
49 metre long and 401 tonne heavy launch
vehicle along with the 1540 kg payload GSAT-1
obeyed instructions to inject the satellite into the
Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) east of
Indonesia. The GTO has a perigee of 185 km and
an apogee of about 36,000 km. The launch speed
of the rocket was 36,720 km per hour which is 8
times the speed of any fighter plane in India.
It was followed by six more launches , GSLVD2 on May 8, 2003 (GSAT-2 1825 kg), GSLVF01 on September 20, 2004 (EDUSAT 1950 kg),
GSLV-F02 on July 10, 2006, GSLV-F04 on
September 2, 2007 (INSAT-4CR 2130 kg),
GSLV-D3 on April 15, 2010 and GSLV-F06 on
December 25, 2010.
<br>
<br>
The launch has put India in the selected
league of nations with the capability to place
multipurpose satellites in orbit and send space
mission. The major gains from the launch are as
follows:
<br>
India pays $70 million to Ariane space for
launch of INSAT satellites. This amount can be
saved. Besides, India can enter the multi billiondollar market for launching communications
satellite. At present U.S., Russia, France, Japan,
China and European Space Consortium
dominate this market. India can benefit through
its lower launch price of Rs. 125 crore and target
the lighter satellites of developing countries.
However, it needs to graduate to the 4 tonne class
to play a more lucrative role.
GSLV gives India the Inter Continental
Ballistic Missile (ICBM) status which can direct
an explosive to a distance of 5000 km. The flight
has certified India’s expertise in putting together
powerful solid fuel propelled rocket motors.
Besides, the immaculate guidance system of
GSLV is an added advantage. India can move
ahead confidently in this direction.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GSLV-III</i></strong></div>

The Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle
Mark III (GSLV-III) is a launch vehicle currently
under development by the ISRO. GSLV Mk III is
conceived and designed to make ISRO fully self
reliant in launching heavier communication
satellites of INSAT-4 class, which weigh 4500 to
5000 kg.
<br>
<br>
GSLV-Mk III is designed to be a three stage
vehicle, 42.4 m tall with a lift off weight of 630
tonnes. First stage comprises two identical S200
Large Solid Booster (LSB) with 200 tonne solid
propellant, that are strapped on to the second
stage, the L110 re-startable liquid stage. The third
stage is the C25 LOX/LH2 cryo stage.
It would also enhance the capability of the
country to be a competitive player in the
multimillion dollar commercial launch market.
The vehicle envisages multi-mission launch
capability for GTO, LEO, Polar and intermediate
circular orbits. Realisation of GSLV Mk-III will
help ISRO to put heavier satellites into orbit.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cryogenic Engine</i></strong></div>

Cryogenics is the science pertaining to very
low temperatures and includes super-low
temperatures of - 150 degree Celsius to - 273
degree Celsius, the latter being called the
‘absolute zero’ temperature. These are
temperatures where gases such as Oxygen,
Nitrogen and Helium are liquified. Such liquified
gases, at their super-cool temperatures find
application in areas like super-conductivity, in
cryo-medicine and cryo-surgery (surgery carried
out at very low temperatures) and rocket
propulsions (where they are used as super-cooled
propellants).
<br>
<br>
The difference between an ordinary liquid
rocket and cryogenic rocket is in the fact that
the oxidiser and fuel used in the cryogenic engine
is only liquid at below freezing temperatures,
whereas in the ordinary liquid rocket the fuel
and oxidiser are liquid at ambient temperatures.
Cryogenic engines, thus, are rocket engines
which use super-cooled liquids as propellants.
These engines use liquid Oxygen and liquid
Hydrogen as fuels and the use of such engines
provides greater thrust and higher degree of
control.
<br>
<br>
Experiments have been tried out with
kerosene and liquid oxygen. This was a quasicryogenic engine experiment. It would not be
difficult to convert this into a cryogenic engine.
Liquid Oxygen (LOX) was the earliest,
cheapest, safest and, eventually, the most
preferred oxidiser for large launch vehicles. In
later years, among the semi-cryogenics, LOXKerosene combination was found to be the best
and is currently preferred worldwide for its price,
safety, least toxicity and specific impulse.
All the leading rocket visionaries identified
liquid hydrogen (LH2) as the theoretically ideal
rocket fuel. Its combination with LOX gives the
highest specific impulse with the least toxicitythe LOX-LH2 rocket exhausts essentially steam.
Cryogenic propellants, semi-cryogenic
propellants and storable liquid propellants, in the
decreasing order- are of higher specific impulse
than solid propellants. Mostly, LOX-Kerosene
and LOX-LH2 are being adopted in the
construction of new launch vehicles for large
satellites (i.e., 2000kg and above).
In February 1998, ISRO successfully tested
an indigenously designed cryogenic engine for
about a minute at its Mahendragiri centre (Tamil
Nadu). The thrust chamber of the engine, in
which liquid Hydrogen (LH2) and liquid Oxygen
(LOX) burns, is cooled by passing liquid
hydrogen through channels milled into the wall
of the thrust chamber. The technique for making
this channel was developed at the Central
Electrochemical Research Institute at Karaikudi
(Tamil Nadu). The test shows that the ISRO has
mastered the process for firing a cryogenic
engine. Before a cryogenic engine is fired, an
elaborate process has to be followed to fill the
propellant tanks and to condition the fuel lines
as well as the injectors. Further in Feb. 2002,
India moved a step closer to the cryogenic
technology when it conducted a successful testfiring of an indigenous cryogenic engine.
On March 28, 2013, successful ignition of an
indigenous cryogenic engine at Mahendragiri in
Tamil Nadu, in conditions simulating the high
altitude atmosphere, has boosted the confidence
of the ISRO to go ahead with the launch of a
Geo-synchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle
(GSLV-D5) in 2013. The hot-test took place in
the newly-built high altitude test facility (HAT)
at ISRO’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre
(LPSC) at Mahendragiri. GSLV-D5, with the
indigenous cryogenic engine, will put into orbit
a communication satellite called GSAT-14.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIAN SATELLITES</i></strong></div>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Aryabhatta:</b>
It was launched on April 19, 1975 from
Baikonur Cosmodrome in the then USSR. It was
put in a near earth orbit at 594 km. altitude. It
orbited the earth once every 96.41 minutes.
Many commands were successfully sent to the

scientific experiments could not be carried out.</li>
        <li><b>Bhaskara I:</b>
The First Experimental Remote Sensing
Satellite built in India. Bhaskara I was launched
on June 7, 1979 again by the Soviets which was
named after Bhaskaracharya, a sixth century
astronomer and another twelfth century
mathematician. Its purpose was to use satellites
for development. It took about four years to
develop and carried remote sensors to detect and
assess natural resources from space. It also had
two TV cameras and three microwave

stations at Sriharikota and Ahmedabad.
Indigenously developed thermal coatings, solar
cells and panels were its special features.</li>
        <li><b>Rohini:</b>
A progressive space programme could not
rely on launches from foreign soil. We had to
develop our own launch facility. For this, the
Satellite Launch Vehicles (SLVs) were developed
and to test their effectiveness, the Rohini satellites
were developed. After a couple of failures in 1979
and 1980, Rohini satellite (RS-I) became the first
Indian satellite to lie launched from Indian soil
by an Indian rocket. It was put in orbit by SLV3 
weighing 35 kgs, it had an elliptical orbit 325
km by 950 km with a period of 97 minutes. It
sent good signals to the ground stations in
Trivandrum, Sriharikota, Car Nicobar and Fiji.</li>
        <li><b>SROSS:</b>
Another series of satellites called the
Stretched Rohini Satellite Series (SROSS) was
developed for the use of scientific payloads. This
was meant to be launched by the Augmented
Satellite. SROSS was launched on March 24,
1987. The satellite was launched onboard the
first developmental a flight of ASLV. It did not
reach the orbit.
<br>
<br>
The launch of SROSS-I and SROSS-II both
for technical purposes on 24th March, 1987 and
13th July 1988 proved unsuccessful. However
SROSS-III was successfully put in orbit on 19th
May 1992 by an ASLV. This satellite, launched
for scientific purposes to detect gamma ray bursts
coming from space and studying the ionosphere,
also gave a boost to the ASLV effort.</li>
        <li><b>Apple:</b>
On 19th June, 1981 India’s first experimental
communication satellite APPLE (Ariane
Passenger Pay Load Experiment) was launched
by Ariane Space Agency. It was used to conduct
experiments on domestic communication, radio
networking, data relay, and remote area
communication, etc.</li>
        <li><b>Kalpana-1:</b>
Kalpana-1 is the first dedicated
meteorological satellite launched by Indian Space
Research Organization using Polar Satellite
Launch Vehicle. This was the first satellite
launched by the PSLV into the Geostationary
orbit. The satellite was originally known as
MetSat-1 but renamed as Kalpana-1 in memory
of Kalpana Chawla - a NASA astronaut who
perished in the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster.
The satellite features a Very High Resolution
scanning Radiometer (VHRR), for three-band
images and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT)
payload. The radiometer scans the earth’s
surface line by line; each line consists of a series
of individual image elements or pixels. For each
pixel the radiometer measures the radioactive
energy of the different spectral bands. This
measurement is digitally coded and transmitted
to the ground station for pre-processing before
being disseminated to the user community.</li>
        <li><b>IRNSS-1A:</b>
It is the first satellite in the Indian Regional

        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Telemedicine Programme</i></strong></div>
            
It is an innovative process of synergising
benefits of Satellite communication technology
and information technology with Biomedical
Engineering and Medical Sciences to deliver the
healthcare services to the remote, distant and
underserved regions of the country.
Providing healthcare to India's over one
billion population of which about 75 per cent
live in villages, is a formidable task. About 75
per cent of the doctors practice in urban areas
and 23 percent in semi-urban areas. This leaves
just 2 per cent of the qualified doctors, who are
attached to about 23,000 primary health and
3000 community health centres, to attend to 70
per cent of the population living in villages.
ISRO’s telemedicine pilot project was started
in the year 2001 with the aim of introducing the
telemedicine facility to the grass root level
population as a part of proof of concept
technology demonstration. The telemedicine
facility connects the remote District Hospitals/
Health Centres with Super Speciality Hospitals
in cities, through the INSAT Satellites for
providing expert consultation to the needy and
underserved population.
<br>
<br>
Telemedicine initiatives at ISRO have been
broadly divided into the following areas:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Providing Telemedicine Technology &

Presently, ISRO’s Telemedicine Network has
enabled 382 Hospitals with the Telemedicine
facility. 306 Remote/Rural/District Hospital/
Health Centres and 16 Mobile Telemedicine units
are connected to 60 Super Speciality Hospitals
located in the major cities. The mobile vans are
extensively used for tele-ophthalmology, diabetic
screening, mammography, childcare and
community health. The Mobile
Teleopthalmology facilities provide services to
the rural population in ophthalmology care,
including village level eye camps, vision
screening for Cataract /Glaucoma / Diabetic
Retinopathy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
The telemedicine facilities are established at
many remote rural district hospitals in many
states and union territories of the country,
including Jammu & Kashmir, Andaman &
Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep Islands, North
Eastern States etc. State level telemedicine
networks are established in Karnataka, Kerala,
Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Orissa and
Chhattisgarh. Many interior districts in Orissa,
Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab,
West Bengal and Gujarat have the telemedicine
facility. About 1.5 Lakh patients are getting the
benefits of Telemedicine every year.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDIAN REMOTE SENSING SYSTEM</i></strong></div>

Over a span of three decades, the space borne
remote sensing capabilities have grown to such
an extent that space-based observation has
become the prime source of information on
earth’s resources and its environment. The
Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites are the
mainstay of National Natural Resources
Management System (NMRMS), for which
department of space is the nodal agency,
providing operational remote sensing data
services. It essentially involves measuring the
electromagnetic radiation of the sun that is
reflected, scattered or re-emitted by the objects
on the surface of the earth.
<br>
<br>
Starting with IRS-1A in 1988, ISRO has
launched many operational remote sensing
satellites into orbit. Today, India has one of the
largest constellations of remote sensing satellites
in operation. Currently, ten operational satellites
are in orbit – RESOURCESAT-1 and 2,
CARTOSAT-1, 2, 2A, 2B, RISAT-1 and 2,
OCEANSAT-2 and Megha-Tropiques. While
RESOURCESAT-1, CARTOSAT-1 and 2 have
successfully completed their designed mission
life in orbit, they continue to provide limited
services to the users. Varieties of instruments
have been flown onboard these satellites to
provide necessary data in a diversified spatial,
spectral and temporal resolutions to cater to
different user requirements in the country and
for global usage. With such satellites in orbit and
considering the plans of the near future, such as
INSAT-3D during 2013, the Indian Earth
Observation System has setup its own niche to
provide high quality data products and services
for national development.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Remote sensing applications</i></strong></div>

Remote sensing has enabled mapping,
studying, monitoring and management of
various resources like agriculture, forestry,
geology, water, ocean, etc. It has further enabled
monitoring of environment and thereby helping
in conservation. In the last four decades it has
grown as a major tool for collecting information
on almost every aspect on the earth. With the
availability of very high spatial resolution
satellites in the recent years, the applications have
multiplied. In India remote sensing has been used
for various applications during the last four
decades and has contributed significantly
towards development.

India has its own satellites like Indian Remote
Sensing Satellite (IRS) series - Resourcesat,
Cartosat, Oceansat, etc. which provide required
data for carrying out various projects. Some of
the important projects carried out in the country
include Groundwater Prospects Mapping under
Drinking Water Mission, Forecasting
Agricultural output using Space,
Agrometeorology and Land based observations
(FASAL), Forest Cover/Type Mapping,
Grassland Mapping, Biodiversity
Characterisation, Snow & Glacier Studies, Land
Use/Cover mapping, Coastal Studies, Coral and
Mangroves Studies, Wasteland Mapping etc. The
information generated by large number of
projects have been used by various departments,
industries and others for different purposes like

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>Groundwater Prospects and Recharge
Zone Mapping</i></strong></div>
            
The occurrence and movement of
groundwater is mainly controlled by many
factors such as rock types, landforms, geological
structures, soil, land use, rainfall, etc. Remote
sensing based groundwater prospect zone map
serves as a base for further exploration using
hydro geological and geophysical methods to
locate well sites. Studies have shown that if
remote sensing data are used at first level to
delineate prospective zones and further followed
up by hydro geological and geophysical surveys,
higher success could be achieved besides savings
in terms of cost, time and work. Further remote
sensing data helps in identifying suitable areas
for recharging ground water. Under Rajiv
Gandhi National Drinking Water Mission,
funded by the Department of Drinking Water
Supply of the Ministry of Rural Development,
ground water prospects and recharge zone
maps on 1:50,000 scale was taken up by ISRO
in phases using IRS data. So far, 14 states
(Andhra Pradesh (Part), Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala, Chattisgarh,
Gujarat, Orissa, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand,
Assam, Punjab, Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh
(Part) have been completed and the maps have
been provided to State Ground Water
Departments and other concerned departments.
The maps have been used for locating well sites
and recharge structures. The feedback shows
that about 275,800 wells have been drilled with
more than 90% success rate and about 9000
recharge structures have been constructed. The
work is under progress for the states of Jammu
& Kashmir, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh-Part,
West Bengal-Part, Haryana and Arunachal
Pradesh.</li>

The primary objective of this project is to map
the wetlands of India (natural, manmade, coastal
and inland) at 1:50,000 scale and create a
database with a query shell. This project has been
taken up at the specific request of Ministry of
Environment and Forests (MoEF). Digital
analysis of two date (pre and post monsoon)
satellite data is used for the purpose. This is the
first time that country will have country specific
classification system, updated database and map
of wetlands at 1:50,000 scale which will help in
conservation/preservation plan, water resources
plan, methane emission study etc. Atlas of 7

The 74th Constitution Amendment Act -
1992 and more specifically under the 12th
Schedule of Municipal Functions envisages
among others, the preparation of spatial plans
for economic development and social justice for
all urban areas. Considering the same, National
Urban Information System (NUIS) is approved
as National Mission Programme of Ministry of
Urban Development (MUD, GOI). NUIS
comprises of broadly two major components -
(a) Urban Spatial Information System (USIS) to
meet the Spatial (maps / images) data /
information requirements of urban planning and
management functions, (b) National Urban Data
Bank & Indicators (NUDB&I) to develop townlevel urban database to support development of
indices through a network of Local Urban
Observatories (LUOs) under the National Urban
Observatory (NUO) Programme.
Under USIS of NUIS a comprehensive 3-tier
GIS database for each town/city to support the
urban planning and management is envisaged:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li> Generate 1:10,000 scale GIS-compatible
spatial information from IRS images and
integrate attribute information to enhance
Master Plan / Development Plan of urban
settlements</li>
        <li>Generate 1:2,000 scale GIS-compatible
spatial information from aerial
photographs and integrate attribute
information to enhance Municipal Plan /
Zonal Plan and detailed Town Planning
schemes.</li>
        <li>Establish a 1:1000 scale utilities GIS using
Ground Penetrating Radar data on a pilot
basis to include water-supply, sewerage,
power and communication for Utilities
Planning and Management.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

DOS is participating in the endeavor of NUIS
taken up under NNRMS Standing Committee
on Urban development. Apart from providing
IRS satellite data and aerial photography, DOS
shares the responsibility of the preparation of
thematic maps at 1:10,000 scale. In Phase-I, 158
towns covering geographical area of around
55,755 sq km has been taken up. As a pilot
project, thematic mapping for the Korba town
located in Chattisgarh State covering 276 sq km.
has been completed. About 75 towns had been
completed during 2009 and planned to complete
the remaining towns soon thereafter.</li>

The Indian remote sensing programme is
intended to be a key element of India’s ambitious
National Natural Resource Management System
(NNRMS). NNRMS was established in 1983 and
is supported by Planning Commission,
Government of India. Department of Space
(DOS) is the nodal agency for implementing
NNRMS in the.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The NNRMS with its headquarters in
Bengaluru is functioning with the main objective
of liaising with different users of the State/
Central Government departments/organisations
in different tasks related to the use of remote
sensing data, such as, the establishment of
infrastructure for remote sensing centre/unit/
cell, supply of equipment for data processing and
analysis, organising the information system for
the remote sensing data in management of
natural resources in the country. In doing so,
NNRMS adopts various advanced technologies
of satellite and aerial remote sensing;
Geographical Information Systems (GIS); precise
Positioning Systems; database and networking
infrastructure and advanced ground-based
survey techniques.
<br>
<br>
The three major components of NNRMS
are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>application projects</li>
        <li>infrastructure and manpower
development</li>
        <li>establishing a National Natural
Resources Information System (NNRIS).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

The applications project will be in major
resource sectors such as agriculture, land use,
water resources, forestry, geology, marine
resources and environment.
DOS/ISRO is the lead agency for a significant
number of application projects. These projects
are being executed in collaboration with a large
number of State and Central Government
agencies. Major contributions in the disciplines
of soil, vegetation mapping and mineral
targeting will be made from the National Bureau
of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning/ICAR,
Forest Survey of India (Ministry of Environment
and Forests) and Geological Survey of India
(GSI), respectively.
<br>
<br>
Five Regional Remote Sensing Service Centres
(RRSSCs) are being set up for processing remote
sensed data. The Dehradun and Bengaluru
centres are already operational. The centres at
Nagpur, Kharagpur, and Jodhpur are
underway. Another centre for the north-eastern
region is planned. DOS will manage these
regional centres initially. The backbone of the
RRSSCs as well as the associate centres is a
digital image analysis system primarily for
handling satellite acquired terrain multispectral
data.

Bhuvan is an initiative to showcase this
distinctiveness of India's imaging capabilities,
including the thematic information derived from
such imagery which could be of vital importance
to a common man with a focus on Indian region.
Bhuvan, an ambitious project of ISRO to take
Indian images and thematic information in
multiple spatial resolutions to people through a
web portal through easy access to information
on basic natural resources in the geospatial
domain. Bhuvan showcases Indian images by the
superimposition of these IRS satellite imageries
on 3D globe. It displays satellite images of
varying resolution of India’s surface, allowing
users to visually see things like cities and
important places of interest looking
perpendicularly down or at an oblique angle,
with different perspectives and can navigate
through 3D viewing environment. The degree
of resolution showcased is based on the points
of interest and popularity, but most of the Indian
terrain is covered upto at least 5.8 metres of
resolution with the least spatial resolution being
55 metres from AWiFs Sensor. With such rich
content, Bhuvan opens the door to graphic
visualisation of digital geospatial India allowing
individuals to experience the fully interactive
terrain viewing capabilities.
<br>
<br>
Multi-resolution images from multi-sensor
IRS satellites of India is seamlessly depicted
through the Bhuvan web portal by enabling a
common man to zoom into specific area of
interest at high resolution. Bhuvan brings a
whole lot of uniqueness in understanding our
own natural resources whilst presenting
beautiful images and thematic vectors generated
from varieties of geospatial information. Bhuvan
will also attempt to bring out the importance of
multi-temporal data and to highlight the changes
taking place to our natural resources, which will
serve as a general awareness on our changing
planet. There are lot more special value added
services which will be enabled onto the web
portal in due course of time and each one of those
services are going to be unique in preserving and
conserving our precious natural resources
through public participation. We are sure the
common man will get rich benefits from these
Indian geospatial data services in days to come.
Bhuvan Geoportal entered its fourth year of
operations in August 2012. During this period,
Bhuvan has evolved both in terms of the content
and features besides speed and access. The portal
had an average of 19,000 visitors per month
during the last one year. In addition to
visualisation, Bhuvan has been providing satellite

deg to the equator. Chandrayaan-I mission was
abandoned in August 2009 when the spacecraft
lost radio contact.
<br>
<br>
Chandrayaan-1 is India’s first and the
world’s 68th mission to the moon. The world’s
first moon mission was by the then Union of
Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) on Jan 2, 1959,
followed two months later by the US on March
3. Between them, the two countries have sent
62 missions to probe the moon with the US
stealing a march over the then cold war rival
USSR by landing a man on the moon on July 20,
1969.
<br>
<br>
Japan broke the monopoly of the two
superpowers on Jan 24, 1990 by sending its
spacecraft Hiten to orbit the moon. The European
Space Agency launched its probe in September
2003. China sent its spacecraft Chang'e II in
2012.
<br>
<br>
The first hard landing on the moon was on
Sep 12, 1959 by Soviet Union’s Luna 2. The first
photos from the moon were taken by Oct 4, 1959
from the Soviet spacecraft Luna 3.
On Jan 26, 1962, the US Ranger 3 missed the
Moon by 36,793 km. The Soviet Union’s Luna 6
did worse on June 8, 1965 missing the moon by
160,000 km. Luna 9 made up for it on Jan 31,
1966 by becoming the first spacecraft to soft land

The Chandrayaan-1 mission was aimed at
high-resolution remote sensing of the moon in
visible, near infrared (NIR), low energy X-rays
and high-energy X-ray regions. Specifically the
objectives are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>To prepare a three-dimensional atlas
(with high spatial and altitude resolution
of 5-10 m) of both near and far side of
the moon.</li>
        <li>To conduct chemical and mineralogical
mapping of the entire lunar surface for
distribution of mineral and chemical
elements such as Magnesium, Aluminum,
Silicon, Calcium, Iron and Titanium as
well as high atomic number elements such
as Radon, Uranium & Thorium with high
spatial resolution.</li>
        <li>The Simultaneous photo geological,
mineralogical and chemical mapping
through Chandrayaan-1 mission will
enable identification of different geological
units to infer the early evolutionary history
of the Moon. The chemical mapping will
enable to determine the stratigraphy and
nature of the Moon’s crust and thereby
test certain aspects of magma ocean
hypothesis. This may allow to determine
the composition of impactors that
bombarded the Moon during its early
evolution which is also relevant to the
formation of the Earth.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RISAT-1</i></strong></div>

RISAT 1 (Radar Imaging Satellite 1) is the
first satellite imaging mission of ISRO using an
active C-band SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar)
imager. The objective of the RISAT mission is to
use the all-weather as well as the day-and-night
SAR observation capability in applications such
as agriculture, forestry, soil moisture, geology,
sea ice, coastal monitoring, object identification,
and flood monitoring.
<br>
<br>
RISAT 1 is developed, manufactured and
integrated by ISRO. The Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle (PSLV-C19) successfully launched
RISAT-1 on the desired orbit, thus reducing
India’s dependence on countries like Israel that
uses microwave signals to capture images of the
earth.
RISAT-1 is a variant of microwave remote
sensing satellite (MRSS) and is equipped with
synthetic aperture radar payload in the C-band
(5.35 GH) frequency. It is better than the
previously used optical remote sensing satellites
which could capture images during the day only
as Optical satellites are relying on sunlight to
illuminate the ground below, working much like
an ordinary camera does. Radar satellites, on the
other hand, send out pulses of radio waves and
then pick up signals that bounce back.
During its mission life of five years, the
RISAT-1 will use its active microwave remote
sensing capability for cloud penetration and 
daynight imaging of the earth surface and provide
critical data inputs for a range of agricultural
and soil moisture studies and forestry
applications. Among the many tasks the RISAT1 can perform are paddy monitoring in kharif
season, crop estimation and mapping of forestry
biomass, besides providing the big picture on
natural disasters such as flood and cyclone.

The Space Capsule Recovery Experiment
(SCRE/SRE/SRE-1) was an Indian experimental
spacecraft, launched on January 10, 2007 from
Sriharikota using the PSLV C7 rocket, along with
three other satellites. It remained in orbit for 12
days before re-entering the Earth’s atmosphere
and splashing down into the Bay of Bengal on
January 22. During its reentry, the 555 kg
capsule was protected from the intense heat by
carbon phenolic ablative material and silica tiles
on its outer surface.
<br>
<br>
The SRE 1 was designed to demonstrate the
capability to recover an orbiting space capsule,
and the technology of an orbiting platform for
performing experiments in microgravity
conditions. It was also intended to test reusable
Thermal Protection System, navigation, guidance
and control, hypersonic aero-thermodynamics,
management of communication blackout,
deceleration and floatation system and recovery
operations.
<br>
<br>
ISRO is also working on technology to
manufacture carbon-carbon composite heat
shields, which, along with the silica tiles tested
with the SRE, could find use in future reusable
spacecraft such as ISRO’s planned Reusable
Launch Vehicle. During its stay in orbit, the
following two experiments on board SRE 1 were
successfully conducted under microgravity
conditions.
<br>
<br>
One of the experiments was related to the
study of metal melting and crystallization under
microgravity conditions. The second experiment
was intended to study the synthesis of nanocrystals 
under microgravity conditions. This was
an experiment in designing biomaterials that
better replicate natural biological products.</li>
        <li>SRE-2 Project was formed with the main
objective of realising a fully recoverable capsule
and to provide a platform to conduct microgravity experiments. SRE capsule has four
major hardware, namely, Aero Thermostructure (ATS), Spacecraft platform,
deceleration and floatation system and
payloads.
<br>

minimum energy transfer opportunity from
Earth to Mars occurs once in 26 months, the
opportunity in 2013 demands a cumulative
incremental velocity of 2.592 km/sec.
<br>
<b>Mission to Mars (during November 2013
launch opportunity):</b>
Mars with its many similarities to earth is an
important planet to understand the origin and
evolution of the solar system. India certainly
cannot afford to be behind in its independent
exploration of the red planet. India’s first Mission
to Mars during 2013 would be important more
from the technological perspective, namely,
entire mission design, planning, management
and operations, and communication from a
distance of nearly 400 million km. This mission
will demonstrate ISRO’s capability to undertake
deep-space planetary mission where the travel
time from earth to Mars is nearly 300 days. The
Indian Mission to Mars would also provide an
opportunity to the scientific community, to
further understand the Martian Science.
The present plan is to launch a Mars-orbiter
using PSLV-XL during the November 2013
launch opportunity. Mars-orbiter will be placed
in an orbit of 500×80,000 km around Mars and
will have a provision for carrying nearly 25 kg
of scientific payloads on board. An indicative
plan outlay of `39,750 crore at current prices for
the Twelfth Five Year has been made for the DOS.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM</i></strong></div>

The Global Positioning System (GPS) is a
space-based global navigation satellite system
(GNSS) that provides reliable location and time
information in all weather and at all times and
anywhere on or near the Earth when and where
there is an unobstructed line of sight to four or
more GPS satellites. It is maintained by the
United States government and is freely accessible
by anyone with a GPS receiver. GPS was created
and realized by the U.S. Department of Defense
(USDOD) and was originally run with 24
satellites. It was established in 1973 to overcome
the limitations of previous navigation systems.
GPS works in six logical steps:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The basis of GPS is “triangulation” from
satellites.</li>
        <li>To “triangulate,” a GPS receiver measures
distance using the travel time of radio
signals.</li>
        <li>To measure travel time, GPS needs very
accurate timing which it achieves with
some tricks.</li>
        <li>Along with distance, you need to know
exactly where the satellites are in space.
High orbits and careful monitoring are the
secret.</li>
        <li>You must correct for any delays the signal
experiences as it travels through the
atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Finally (for us), you can now obtain the
precise time from the GPS satellites.
Improbable as it may seem, the whole idea
behind GPS is to use satellites in space as
reference points for locations here on earth.
That’s right, by very, very accurately measuring
our distance from three satellites we can
“triangulate” our position anywhere on earth.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Triangulation-What is it?</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Position is calculated from distance
measurements (ranges) to satellites.</li>
        <li>Mathematically we need four satellite
ranges to determine exact position.</li>
        <li>Three ranges are enough if we reject
ridiculous answers or use other tricks.</li>
        <li>Another range is required for technical
reasons.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Now, we come to the other varieties of
Satellite based navigation platforms, though all
of them work on the same basic principle but
have their own set of satellites being controlled
by different ‘master-key’ i.e. nation/union that
owns them. Henceforth, all the powerful nations
having strategic geopolitical angle to their
existential identity are some way into building
their own SATNAV system.

        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>GLONASS</i></strong></div>    
        
Global Navigation Satellite System is a 
radiobased satellite navigation system operated for the
Russian government by the Russian Space
Forces. Development on the GLONASS began
in the Soviet Union in 1976, with a goal of global
coverage by 1991. Beginning on 12 October 1982,
numerous rockets launches added satellites to
the system until the constellation was completed
in 1995. Following completion, the system fell
into disrepair with the collapse of the Russian
economy. Beginning in 2003, Russia committed
to restoring the system and by 2010 it had
achieved 100% coverage of Russia’s territory. As
on July 30, 2013, total satellites in the GLONASS
constellation were 29, in which 24 satellites being
operational, while one satellite is in maintenance,
one in Flight Tests phase and 3 more are spare
ones.</li>
        <li>
        <div class="subheading"><strong><i>GALILEO</i></strong></div>    
        
Galileo is a global navigation satellite system
(GNSS) currently being built by the European
Union (EU) and European Space Agency (ESA).
The •5 billion project is named after the famous
Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei. One of the
political aims with Galileo is to provide a highaccuracy positioning system upon which
European nations can rely independent from the
Russian GLONASS and US GPS systems which
can be disabled for commercial users in times of
war or conflict.
<br>
<br>
When in operation, it will use the two ground
operations centers, one near Munich, Germany,
and another in Fucino, Italy and will consist of
30 satellites (27 operational + 3 active spares).
The first experimental satellite, GIOVE-A, was
launched in 2005 and was followed by a second
test satellite, GIOVE-B, launched in 2008. On
October 21, 2011, the first two of four
operational satellites were launched to validate
the system. The next two followed on October
12, 2012, making it possible to test Galileo 
endto-end. Once this In-Orbit Validation (IOV)
phase has been completed, additional satellites
will be launched to reach Initial Operational
Capability (IOC) around mid-decade and this
will become fully operational by the year 2019.
Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS)
The Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is
a proposed three-satellite regional time transfer
system and enhancement for the Global
Positioning System that would be receivable
within Japan. The first satellite ‘Michibiki’ was
launched on 11 September 2010. Full operational
status is expected by 2013, though with the
pacifist approach in for a severe change with
the new Japanese government belonging to the
Centre-left approach, and also the economy
growing may be this date can pre-pone.
In March 2013, Japan announced the
expansion of the Quasi-Zenith Satellite System
from three satellites to four. The $526 million
contract with Mitsubishi Electric for the
construction of three satellites is slated for
launch before the end of 2017.</li>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BEIDOU Navigation System</i></strong></div>

The BeiDou Navigation System or BeiDou
(COMPASS) Navigation Satellite System is a
project by China to develop an independent
satellite navigation system. It may refer to either
one or both generations of the Chinese navigation
system. The first BEIDOU system, officially
called BEIDOU Satellite Navigation
Experimental System, or known as BeiDou-1,
consists of 3 satellites and has limited coverage
and applications. It has been offering navigation
services mainly for customers in China and from
neighboring regions since 2000. The second
generation of the system known as Compass or
BEIDOU-2 will be a global satellite navigation
system consisting of 35 satellites, is still under
construction.
<br>
<br>
It became operational in China in December
2011, with 10 satellites in use, and began offering
services to customers in the Asia-Pacific region
in December 2012 and the global system will be
started by 2020. The chief designer of BeiDou
navigation system is Sun JIADONG.
India's satellite-based navigation systemGAGAN
A satellite-based navigation system to aid air
traffic from Southeast Asia to Africa, including
over the high seas in the vast region, has been
launched successfully, placing India into a select
group of nations which possess such a
sophisticated technology. GAGAN or the GPS
Aided Geo Augmented Navigation will also help
in marine navigation, search and rescue
operations, rail and road transport, survey and
mapping as well as precision farming. The
system, developed jointly by the Indian Space
Research Organisation and Airports Authority
of India, would operationalise a satellite-based
Indian Flight Information Region in conjunction
with all nations from Southeast Asia, Gulf and
West Asia and the eastern coast of Africa. It
would be based on a satellite constellation
consisting of 24 satellites positioned in 
six earthcentered orbital planes. When commissioned,
GAGAN is expected to provide civil aeronautical
navigation signals consistent with International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards
based on the Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) Panel, as part of the Future Air
Navigation System for the aviation sector. Final
System Acceptance Test (FSAT) of GAGAN was
successfully completed during July 2012. The
FSAT results have successfully demonstrated
that GAGAN Signals meet the Civil aviation
requirements.
<br>
<br>
Conclusively, we can say that not only
geopolitical angles of the post cold war that has
engulfed the technical prowess of a nation but 
in today’s world keeping information network
secure and secretive has also become important.
Reason behind this growing importance of own
navigation pattern can be fear of cyber war as
we we have seen with the stuxnet on the verge of
attacking Iranian electric supply lines and its
nuclear installations.
