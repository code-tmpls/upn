<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUPER-CONDUCTIVITY</i></strong></div>

The flow of electrons is called current and
the materials in which the electrons flow is called
a conductor. Copper, mercury, aluminium, etc.
are good conductors whereas glass, rubber and
wood are bad conductors or insulators. Materials
that don’t conduct electricity better than copper
are called semi-conductors.
<br>
<br>
In a world plagued by energy crisis, the
concept of super-conductivity has come about
as a boon to mankind. We know that conductors
are mediums that allow electricity to flow
through them. However, due to the resistance
offered by the medium, the current-carrying
capacity of the medium is almost reduced to half
its capability. It has been known that temperature
is a factor that contributes to this resistance,
hence, if the temperature of the carrier could be
lowered to absolute zero (0K or “–273°C), these
carriers could be made super-conductive,
because at this temperature they lose all
resistance.
<br>
<br>
It was in the year 1911 that a Dutch physicist
Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, discovered ‘Superconductivity’. While studying the variation of
electrical resistance of mercury with
temperature, he found that at near the absolute
zero temperature, the resistance dropped down
to a very small value. It was, however, found
that this transition to super-conductivity
involved more than simply very high or infinite
electrical conductivity. The next step towards
unfolding the mystery of super-conductivity took
place in 1933, when W. Meissner and R.
Ochsenfeld found that a super-conductor placed
in a magnetic field expelled the field from the
interior of the conductor. Later, it was found that
superconductivity needed a temperature of 4.2K,
which was the point at which helium gas
liquifies. Thus, the super-conductive devices had
to be submerged in liquid helium. The main
bottleneck was the high cost involved in such a
process. The discovery of liquid nitrogen as a
replacement for liquid helium cut down the costs
considerably. It was also found that superconductive materials like lead, mercury and tin
lost their capability as soon as enough current
flowed through them to generate magnetic fields.
Further research with ceramics, the alloys of
oxides of niobium and titanium, proved that
these kept their conductivity despite strong
magnetic fields. It was in 1973, that Karl Alex
Muller of Zurich Laboratory decided to work on
metallic oxides called ceramics. Paul C.W. Chu
of Houston University found that superconducting materials got damaged when their
temperature was raised to 52K. Hence, he
replaced Barium with Strontium which has a
smaller atomic structure and he could raise the
temperature to 54K. Later, with the use of rare
earth element, temperature was raised to 98K.
Today, Thallium, Barium, Calcium, Copper
oxide, Bismuth, Strontium, Yttrium are
considered the most attractive materials for
super-conductivity.
<br>
<br>
<b>Uses and Applications:</b> Super-conductors
have many advantages over normal conductors.
These are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In normal conductors, the energy lost
because of resistance is given off as heat
which makes the packing of electrical
circuits risky. Thus, a super-conductor
with no resistance and consequently no
heat building is found suitable to pack
the circuits tightly.</li>
        <li>They save electricity as energy loss due
to resistance offered by conductors is
reduced.</li>
        <li>They have ability to generate very
powerful fields from relatively small
superconducting electromagnets.</li>
        <li>They can create Josephson junction
which is capable of detecting minute
magnetic fields and also have the
advantage of switching 100 times faster.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

These magnetic field detectors are called
super-conducting quantum interference
devices or SQUIDS.
<br>
<br>
Due to these inherent advantages, superconductors have been put to a variety of uses:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Super-conductor electromagnets are
used to generate extremely powerful
magnetic fields which are used in atomic
colliders.</li>
        <li>Mass drivers are used to accelerate the
object to very high velocities.</li>
        <li>Super-conductors are also used in
magneto cardiograms, nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR), magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), etc. These procedures
help the medical experts to take detailed
images of organs without having to cut
open the skin.</li>
        <li>Magnetic levitated trains (M.L.T.) float
4 inches above their tracks and hence
no friction is involved which could have
limited their speed. These so called
‘Bullet Trains’ move at very high speed
upto 500 mph.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<b>Research in India:</b> Acknowledging the
importance of super-conductivity, a Programme
Management Group was set up by the
Government in 1987. It was soon replaced by
the National Super-conductivity Science and
Technology Board in 1991. Research work was
entrusted to DAE, CSIR and IITs. The areas of
research work included improvement in critical
temperature, workability of Yitrium, Bismuth,
Thalium, QNG and MTMG techniques, SQUIDS,
HGMS, etc.
<br>
<br>
The National Physical Laboratory, New
Delhi, has developed a SQUID at liquid Nitrogen
temperature of 77K. They will help in geological
prospecting and bio-magnetism. Similarly,
Super-conducting magnetic ore separators are
being used in places like Kudremukh, etc. In yet
another field, super-conducting compounds
called monophasic compounds with a critical
transition temperature of 110 K, 90K and 80K
have been obtained. The highest critical
transition temperature of 110 K has been reached
for the compound bismuth, strontium, calcium
and copper oxide. In a major development,
Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited, Hyderabad has
built and tested the country’s first
superconducting generator. The generator is
cooled by liquid helium and has a capacity of
generating 200KV amperes. It has succeeded in
cutting down on energy loss, but the use of liquid
helium is proving very costly and efforts are on
to substitute it with a relatively cheaper liquid
Nitrogen.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LASER</i></strong></div>

The name ‘LASER’ is an acronym for Light
Amplification by Stimulated Emission of
Radiation. A ‘Laser’ is an electric apparatus for
producing unified light waves that can be exactly
controlled, precisely focused, and when desired,
made extremely powerful. It can be aimed
precisely enough to destroy a dangerous skin
tumour without affecting other healthy skin
tissues.
<br>
<br>
‘Laser’ light has certain remarkable
properties, which make it chromatic, for
example, a red laser beam has only red light.
Laser is very coherent and can be transmitted
over great distances, without the beam
spreading. It also has the advantage that a lot of
power is concentrated in a very small area. On
the other hand, Sunlight, electric light and the
light from a candle is incoherent. It is a jumble
of different wavelengths and brightness, in what
seems to be a steady light emitted in every
direction. To produce a coherent beam, the
original light has to be coherent, and that’s what
a laser is for.
<br>
<br>
<b>Applications:</b> The Laser beams, which are a
coherent beam of light and intense enough to
vaporise the hardest material ever known, are
being used to drill holes in diamond, to weld
detached retina of eye and destroy maligant brain
tumours located deep inside the brain or in the
spinal cord, and to transmit information. Some
of the major use of laser beams are :
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>In Consumer Electronics: In the
consumer electronics industry, compact
discs (CDs) have revolutionised the
audio industry with their durability and
the fidelity of reproduction. Lasers are
an essential part of the recording and
reading of Compact Discs (CDs). The
recording process is basically similar to
that of an LP, except that instead of a
needle, laser lights are used to read the
‘grooves’. Since the waves are extremely
small, the amount of information stored
on a CD can be huge, leading to
exceptional fidelity.</li>
        <li>In Computer Technology: Computer
memories are another area where lasers
have had a tremendous impact on
ROMs (Read Only Memories). These
optical discs allow a far more dense
storage of data, which are extremely
durable and have a further advantage
in having much faster access times for
retrieval of data.</li>
        <li>In Industries: The whole edifice of
today’s industrial society is based on
reliable and fast communications. Lasers
are playing an extremely vital role in
providing data networks.
<br>
<br>
In clothing factories, computer-guided
lasers move across dozens of layers to
cloth at a time, cutting material for
dozens of suits in a minute. In machine
shops, lasers cut through steel much
faster than saws or other wedge tools.
In a car factory, high-power laser beams
spot-weld the parts of a car body
together.
<br>
<br>
Industrial applications of Lasers provide
a very concentrated and easilycontrolled source of energy. This
property finds use in laser welding and
drilling, especially where sensitive parts
have to be welded and the damage to
the surrounding parts is to be
minimised.</li>
        <li>Medicine & Health Care: Laser surgery
is becoming increasingly, safe and
cheap, thanks to the rapid pace of
technical development. One of the
earliest medical uses of lasers was in
retinal surgery, where detached retinas
were fixed. With the development of
fibre optics, lasers are being used to
‘burn’ arterial clots, thus, preventing
risky and expensive open-heart surgery.
A wide beam of laser light can be
focused to an extremely fine point, thus,
producing a very high temperature at
that point. This type of tools is called a
‘heat knife’, which are used by the
surgeons to produce self-cauterizing
cuts.</li>
        <li>In Defence: Lasers are being used to
generate the immense temperatures
required to study thermonuclear fusion,
and like other technologies, lasers are
being conceived as offensive and
defensive weapons. In fact, lasers
formed one of the main technological
mainstays of the Strategic Defence
Initiative or Star Wars.
Lasers are used to find the target and
to measure the range of targets
accurately, fusion process requires a
starting temperature of millions of
degrees, obtained by concentrated laser
beams.</li>
        <li>In Telecommunication: In a telephone
system employing Fibre Optics, voice
vibrations are converted into pulses of
laser light, thousands of per second.
This would be impossible with ordinary
light sources, such as, tungsten bulb,
which require start-up and cool-down
time for each light pulse. Laser light is
instantaneous, so millions of pulses can
be transmitted in a second. A hair-thin
glass fibre can carry several thousand
telephone messages at once.</li>
        <li>In cleaning of monuments: Cleaning by
laser, which was introduced in Italy in
the 1970s, has until now remained an
expensive method with a generally
limited performance, mainly consisting
of laboratory equipment transported to
the site. With the development of Lama
(portable laser for the cleaning of
facades and historic buildings),
however, a decisive step has been taken
that could see the widespread adoption
of laser-cleaning.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Laser Technology in India</i></strong></div>

The importance of laser was recognized by
the scientific community in India fairly early and
several institutions initiated research and
development (R&D) projects, although modest
ones, in this area in the mid-sixties. Since then,
laser-related R&D programmes in India have
expanded considerably and now encompasses
most of the Department of Atomic Energy to
develop lasers and explore their applications has
been quite massive.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Homi Bhabha, the founder of Indian
atomic energy programme, always encouraged
research in frontier areas of science, whether or
not directly related to the atomic energy
programme. Thus, a modest attempt to develop
semiconductor lasers at the Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre (BARC) was initiated in 1964
though at that time laser was in its infancy and
its applications were limited. The first
semiconductor laser in India was developed at
BARC in 1965. This was a major achievement
for India. In another significant breakthrough
an optical communication link using Indianmade semiconductor laser was established in
1966 between BARC and the Tata Institute of
Fundamental Research (TIFR), a distance of 20
kms. Dr. Bhabha had constantly encouraged this
activity and had often visited the laboratories
and the site of the optical transmitter to
encourage the scientists. Dr. Bhabha’s successors
continued his policy of encouraging research in
frontline science after his tragic death in an air
crash in 1967.
<br>
<br>
The laser-related activity in the Department
of Atomic Energy got a fillip in 1987 when a new
research institute called Centre for Advanced
Technology (CAT) was established. Since its
inception, CAT has made commendable progress
in both the areas and is widely recognised as an
important R&D centre of India.
At present over 90 research institutions are
working on various aspects of lasers, like their
fabrications, development of laser materials and
their applications to various fields like
meteorology, communications, medicines,
isotope separation and in basic researches.
Scientists then started indigenous commercial
production of nitrogen, argon, helium, cadmium,
and nitrogen pumped dye lasers at various units.
BARC has also done extensive work on Go2
lasers.
<br>
<br>
In the field of semiconductor lasers, which
differ from other lasers, works are going on at
BARC and Solid State Physics Laboratory, New
Delhi. The major centres in India with extensive
facilities for development of lasers are BARC,
Mumbai, IIT, Kanpur, IIS, Bangalore and BHU,
Varanasi. The Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research, Mumbai, BARC, Mumbai, IIT,
Kharagpur are the centres where theoretical
works on lasers or related topics are being carried
out.
<br>
<br>
The Survey of India is making use of lasers
in range findings, whereas, for accurate
measurement of air pollutants through Rayleigh
scattering by Laser Diffractrometer, IIT, Madras
has done significant works.
Hence lasers have wide range of
applications. But due to limited availability of
lasers, their components and cost effectiveness,
the activities are still very slow in our country in
comparison to other countries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Laser Development</i></strong></div>

As the name suggests, Centre for Advanced
Technology (CAT) has given priority to
developing technologies of important lasers and
exploring their application in industry, medicine
and R&D. The first laser built at CAT was a
copper vapour laser. It is the most powerful laser
emitting visible light. Copper vapour lasers
capable of giving upto 40 Watt average power
had been development at CAT. These lasers are
also used to pump tunable dye lasers whose
wavelengths can be changed. Several such lasers
have been given by CAT to universities and
another research laboratories for spectroscopic
studies.
<br>
<br>
Another important laser developed by CAT
is the carbon dioxide (CO2) laser. Incidentally,
the CO2
<br>
<br>
laser was invented by a well-known
Indian scientist, Dr. C.K.N. Patel, who was then
working at Bell Labs in USA. CAT has developed
technologies of several types of CO2
lasers
namely, low power slow CO2
 laser, high power
fast flow CO2
 laser, tunable CO2
 laser and high
pressure pulsed CO2
 laser and is also pursuing
applications of these CO2
 lasers in medicine and
industry. Laser surgery has many advantages
over conventional surgery. In laser surgery there
is virtually no bleeding, far less trauma to the
patients and healing is faster. Although use of
laser in surgery is widespread in the western
countries, its application in India was limited
due to the high cost of imported surgical lasers.
CAT therefore decided to develop a surgical laser
based on a 60W CO2. This surgical laser has an
articulated arm with seven elbows to allow the
surgeon to guide the laser beam. The laser is
designed for Indian conditions and can
withstand the extreme ambience. Twelve such
lasers have already been supplied to hospitals in
India in cities extending from Delhi to
Thiruvananthapuram and from Mumbai to
Kolkata.
<br>
<br>
Medical Applications: CAT has also been
developing lasers for surgery. It has promoted
research in this area in various hospitals through
a National Laser Programme. Apart from the
surgical CO2
 laser, CAT has developed nitrogen
laser for medical use. Nitrogen laser has been
found useful for treatment of tuberculosis. Many
patients of TB develop cavities in their lungs
which become breeding ground of the TB
bacillus.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RADAR AND SONAR</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RADAR:</i></strong></div>

It is acronym for Radio Detecting and
Ranging. Radar is a technique and apparatus
for determining the location of an object by the
use of radio-waves. The most visible and
ubiquitous aspects of radar are the rotating,
curved-surface antennas seen on the top of most
ships and airport towers. Not visible, but equally
important, are the radar antennas hidden in the
noses of aeroplanes.
<br>
<br>
It is a system employing microwaves for the
purpose of locating, identifying, navigating or
guiding such objects as ships, aircrafts, missiles
or official satellites. It can determine the
direction, distance, height and speed of objects
that are not visible to the human eyes.
The working principle of radar is similar to
that of sight. We see an object when light waves
fall on an object and are reflected from it, and
reach our eyes forming an image of it. Radar uses
a powerful radio transmitter to illuminate objects
with radio-waves and a sensitive radio receiver
to detect the reflected waves, also called echoes,
which are amplified and electronically
transformed so that they can be seen on a display
monitor as spots of light or as an image of the
object observed. A single antenna, generally,
serves both as a transmitter and receiver.
In operation, radar antennas emit pulses of
radio-waves, about 1000 pulses per second, each
lasting about a millionth of a second. The waves
travel at the speed of light, i.e., 3,00,000 kms per
second or 1,86,000 miles per second, until they
strike some reflecting surface, which may be
almost anything from solid rock to the water
vapour in clouds. The reflected waves are
received by the same antenna, in the intervals
between the pulses. The time interval between
outgoing and reflected pulses is continually
translated into visual data on the screen of a
cathode ray tube, similar to a TV picture tube.
The time taken for the reflected waves to return,
gives the distance of the object and the direction
of return tells about its location.
<br>
<br>
<b>Application:</b> Radar has a large variety of
applications, involving precise measurements of
distances. Besides, being used for navigating
ships and aircrafts, it is used for mapping storms
and other meteorological disturbances, and
studying planets and their Moons or Satellites.
It is used for determining altitudes of
aeroplanes, navigating in fog and in the dark,
and even mapping the cloud-shrouded surface
of Venus. A useful application of radar is for
‘police speed traps’. Here, a special radar device
is used, which responds differently to the
reflections from moving objects and stationary
objects.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SONAR:</i></strong></div>

Acronym for Sound Navigation and
Ranging, Sonar is a technique and apparatus for
determining the location of an object by reflected
sound-waves. In fact, it is a system for detecting
and locating submerged objects or
communication under water by transmitting a
high frequency sound wave and collecting the
reflected wave.
<br>
<br>
The Sonar principle is used to determine the
depth of shallow bodies of water and to locate
fish, under-water submarines, mines, wrecks,
and other obstacles. Initially, developed as a
military instrument for locating submarines, it
is widely used for measuring water depth, and
in Arctic regions, for measuring ice-thickness.
In Active Sonar, pulses of high-frequency
(high-pitched) sounds are beamed downwards
and at angles from the bottom of a ship. The
‘echoes’ are received by an apparatus that
measures the time interval, then computes the
distance and friction of the reflecting object. This
information is shown on a dial or plotted

animation software to change one image
into another using a series of intermediate
images. Morphing is used to provide
many of the special effects seen in popular
movies where a man turns into a wolf, or
a fluffy kitten changes into a furious
roaring lion.</li>
        <li>Multithreading: The concurrent
processing of several tasks or threads
inside the same program. Because several
tasks can be processed in parallel, one task
does not have to wait for another to finish
before starting.</li>
        <li>Outsourcing: To subcontract a company’s
data processing operations to outside
contractors rather than maintain
corporate hardware, software, and staff.
Out sourcing is often used as a cost-cutting
mechanism, although the cost savings are
sometimes difficult to quantify.</li>
        <li>Portability: The degree to which a
program can be moved easily to various
different computing environments with a
minimum number of changes.</li>
        <li>Posting: The process of sending an
individual article or e-mail message to a
USENET newsgroup or to a mailing list.</li>
        <li>Prodigy: An online information service
providing a variety of services to users of
personal computers, including sports,
weather and stock market reports, travel
information, and home shopping services.</li>
        <li>Programming: The process of designing,
writing, testing, debugging, documenting,
and maintaining a program.</li>
        <li>Protocol: In networking and
communications, the specification that
defines the procedures to follow when
transmitting and receiving data. Protocols
define the format, timing, sequence, and
error checking systems used.</li>
        <li>Router: In networking, an intelligent
connecting device that can send packets
to the correct local area network segment
to take them to their destination.</li>
        <li>Semaphore: In programming, an
interprocess communication signal that
indicates the status of a shared system
resource, such as shared memory.</li>
        <li>Sort: To place a set of data items into an
ordered list, either numerically,
alphabetically, or by some other criteria
like file date or time.</li>
        <li>Spamming: To flood someone’s mailbox
with unwanted e-mail messages.</li>
        <li>Swapping: The process of exchanging one
item for another. In a virtual memory
system, swapping occurs when a program
requests a virtual memory location that is
not currently in memory; the information
is then read from disk, and displaces old
information held in memory.</li>
        <li>Telecommuting: Working at home on a
computer connected to the office by
modems and telephone lines instead of
commuting to the office.</li>
        <li>Teleconferencing: The use of audio,
video, or computer systems, linked by a
communications channel, to allow widely
separated individuals to take part in a
discussion or meeting all at the same time.</li>
        <li>Thesaurus: In word processing, a
program feature that locates and suggests
alternative words, or synonyms, from a
list of alternative words stored on disk.</li>
        <li>Thrashing: An excessive amount of disk
activity in a virtual memory system, to
the point where the system is spending
all its time swapping pages in and out of
memory, and no time executing the
application.</li>
        <li>Topology: The map of a network. Physical
topology describes where the cables are
run and the workstations or nodes are
located: logical topology refers to the paths
that messages take to get from one user
on the network to another.</li>
        <li>Trojan horse: A type of virus that
pretends to be a useful program, such as
a game or a utility program, when in
reality it contains special code that will
internationally damage any system onto
which it is loaded.</li>
        <li>Virtual memory: A memory-management
technique that allows information in
physical memory to be swapped out to a
hard disk. This technique provides
application programs with more memory
space than is actually available in the
computer.</li>
        <li>Virtual reality: Abbreviated VR. A
computer generated environment that
presents the illusion of reality. The user
may wear a head-mounted display (HMD)
which displays a three-dimensional image
of the environment, and use an
instrumented glove to manipulate objects
within the environment.</li>
        <li>Voice mail: A computerized store-andforward system for voice messages. A
voice mail system uses prerecorded
messages to route the caller to the correct
person, department, or mailbox, and then
digitizes the incoming messages and stores
them on disk. Recipients can review their
messages and can often forward them to
another department or person after
attaching their own comments.</li>
        <li>Wizard: A technique used by some
applications to guide the inexperienced or
infrequent user through a complex set of
steps by asking questions about the
document they are in the process of
creating as they are actually creating it.</li>
        <li>Channel: In an ISDN system it is the
bearer channel that carries voice or data
at 64 kbps in either direction. This is in
contrast to D channel which is used for
control signals and data about the call
several B channels can be multiplexed into
higher rate H channel.</li>
        <li>HiperLAN: HiperLAN is a set of wiereless
local area network (WLAN)
communication standard primarily used
in European countries. There are two
specifications. HiperLAN/I and
HiperLAN/2. Both have been adopted by
the European Telecommunications
Standards Institute. The HiperLAN
standards provide features and capability
similar to those of the IEEE 802.11 WLAN
standard used in US and other countries.</li>
        <li>Finger: An Internet tool for locating
people on other sites. Finger can also be
used to give access to non-personal
information, but the most common use is
to see if a person has an account at a
particular site.</li>
        <li>Phishing: A technique whereby the
websites of known institutions are entirely
or partly copied and e-mails are used to
obtain private or confidential data of the
customers of those institutions. The
request to provide those data is often
motivated by so-called safety measures or
the need to update data banks.</li>
        <li>Plug-in: A small piece of software that
adds features to a larger software
application. Common plug-ins are those
for web browsers (Real Audio, Quick
Time, etc.) or graphics programs (Kai’s
Power Tools, DigiMarc, etc).</li>
        <li>Shell Account: A software application
that allows use of another machine's
Internet connection. Users do not have a
direct Internet connection, instead, an
Internet connection is made through a
host computer’s connection.</li>
        <li>Packet filter: Looks at each packet
entering or leaving the network and
accepts or rejects it based on user-defined
rules. Packet filtering is fairly effective and
transparent to users, but it is difficult to
configure. In addition, it is susceptible to
IP spoofing.</li>
        <li>Application Gateway: Applies security
mechanisms to specific applications, such
as FTP and Telnet servers. This is very
effective, but can impose a performance
degradation.</li>
        <li>Proxy Server: Intercepts all messages
entering and leaving the network. The
proxy server effectively hides the true
network addresses. In practice, many
firewalls use two or more of these
techniques in concert. A firewall is
considered a first line of defence in
protecting private information. For greater
security, data can be encrypted.</li>
        <li>Flame War: When an online discussion
degenerates into a series of personal
attacks against the debaters, rather than
a discussion of their positions, it is referred
to as a flame war.</li>
        <li>Information Superhighway: There is
some debate about this term. Some claim
it refers to the future, where everyone will
have fast, easy access to the Internet and
things such as video conferencing will be
widely available. Others claim that the
Internet as we already know it is the
information Superhighway.</li>
        <li>Ping: A program for determining if
another computer is presently connected
to the Internet.</li>
        <li>Trolling: The act of deliberately posting
false or inflammatory information in order
to start a flame war or cause aggravation
to others.</li>
        <li>Pixel: Shorthand for “picture element”, a
pixel is the smallest unit of resolution on
a monitor. It is commonly used as a unit
of measurement.</li>
        <li>Router: A computer or software package
that handles the connection between two
or more networks. Routers spend all their
time looking at the destination addresses
of the packets passing though them to
decide which route to send them on.</li>
        <li>Bookmark: It’s just an address book entry
for a Web Address. Some browsers call
this a Favourite Place or a Hot Spot. Most
browsers contain a simple “address book”
where the reader can store the addresses
of their favourite places. Click on the name
of the place, and the Browser
automatically goes there, like an online
phone book with an autodialer.
Bookmaking a site just means adding it to
your address book. When someone
bookmarks your site, it means they are
probably going to come back.</li>
        <li>Data Compression: Any method of
encoding data so that it occupies less space
than in its original form. Many different
mathematical techniques can be used, but
the overall purpose is to compress the data
so that it can be stored, retrieved, or
transmitted more efficiently. Data
compression is used in facsimile and many
other forms of data transmission, CDROM publishing, still image and video
image manipulation and database
management systems.</li>
