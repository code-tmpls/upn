<h3>Great Indian Scientists</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ARYABHATTA</i></strong></div>

Aryabhatta was a great mathematician and
astronomer of India and the earliest known
author on Algebra. It is believed that he was born
in 476 A.D. in Kusumpur, India. Aryabhatta
was a fifth century mathematician, astronomer,
astrologer and physicist. He was a pioneer in the
field of mathematics. At the age of 23, he wrote
Aryabhattiya, which is a summary of
mathematics of his time.
There are four sections in this scholarly work.
In the first section he describes the method of
denoting big decimal numbers by alphabets. In
the second section, we find difficult questions
from topics of modern day Mathematics such as
number theory, geometry, trigonometry and
Beejganita (algebra). The remaining two sections
are on astronomy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mathematics:</i></strong></div>

Aryabhatta's contribution in mathematics is
unparalleled. He suggested formula to calculate
the areas of a triangle and a circle, which were
correct. He was the first mathematician to give
the 'table of the sines', which is in the form of a
single rhyming stanza. This remarkable man
was a genius and continues to baffle many
mathematicians of today. His works was then
later adopted by the Greeks and then the Arabs.
Pi as Irrational: Aryabhata worked on the
approximation for Pi (π), and may have realized
that π is irrational. In the second part of the
Aryabhatiya, he writes "Add four to 100,
multiply by eight and then add 62,000. By this
rule the circumference of a circle of diameter
20,000 can be approached." In other words,
π = ~ 62832/20000 = 3.1416, correct to five
digits. After Aryabhatiya was translated
into Arabic (ca. 820 AD) this approximation was
mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra.
Discovery of zero: Aryabhatta showed that
zero was not a numeral only but also a symbol
and a concept. Discovery of zero enabled
Aryabhatta to find out the exact distance
between the earth and the moon. The discovery
of zero also opened up a new dimension of
negative numerals.
<br>
<br>
Algebra: His other works include algebra,
arithmetic, trigonometry, quadratic equations
and the sine table. He gave the formula 
(a + b)2 =a2+b2+ 2ab
<br>
<br>
Astronomy:
The last two sections of Aryabhattiya were
on Astronomy. Evidently, Aryabhatta contributed greatly to the field of science too,
particularly Astronomy.
In ancient India, the science of astronomy
was well advanced. It was called Khagolshastra.
Khagol was the famous astronomical
observatory at Nalanda, where Aryabhatta
studied. In fact science of astronomy was highly
advanced and our ancestors were proud of it.
The aim behind the development of the
science of astronomy was the need to have
accurate calendars, a better understanding of
climate and rainfall patterns for timely sowing
and choice of crops, fixing the dates of seasons
and festivals, navigation, calculation of time and
casting of horoscopes for use in astrology.
Knowledge of astronomy, particularly
knowledge of the tides and the stars, was of
great importance in trade, because of the
requirement of crossing the oceans and deserts
during night time.
<br>
<br>
Disregarding the popular view that our
planet earth is ‘Achala’ (immovable),
Aryabhatta stated his theory that ‘earth is round
and rotates on its own axis’ He explained that
the appearance of the sun moving from east to
west is false by giving examples. One such
example was: When a person travels in a boat,
the trees on the shore appear to move in the
opposite direction. He also correctly stated that
the moon and the planets shined by reflected
sunlight.
<br>
<br>
He was the first person to say that Earth is
spherical and it revolves around the sun. He
already knew that the earth spins on its axis,
the earth moves round the sun and the moon
rotates round the earth. He talks about the
position of the planets in relation to its movement
around the sun. He refers to the light of the
planets and the moon as reflection from the sun.
He also gave a scientific explanation for solar
and lunar eclipse. He goes as far as to explain
the eclipse of the moon and the sun, day and
night, the contours of the earth, the length of
the year exactly as 365 days.
He even computed the circumference of the
earth as 24835 miles which is close to modern
day calculation of 24900 miles.
Sidereal periods: Considered in modern
English units of time, Aryabhata calculated the
sidereal rotation (the rotation of the earth
referenced the fixed stars) as 23 hours 56 minutes
and 4.1 seconds; the modern value is 23:56:4.091.
Similarly, his value for the length of the sidereal
year at 365 days 6 hours 12 minutes 30 seconds
is an error of 3 minutes 20 seconds over the
length of a year. The notion of sidereal time was
known in most other astronomical systems of the
time, but this computation was likely the most
accurate in the period.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

India's first satellite Aryabhata, was named
after him and the lunar crater Aryabhata is
named in his honour.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SATYENDRA NATH BOSE</i></strong></div>

Satyendra Nath Bose was the great physicist
of the universe, born on January 1, 1894, in
Calcutta (now Kolkata). Satyendra Nath Bose
discovered what became known as ‘bosons’ and
went on to work with Albert Einstein to define
one of two basic classes of subatomic particles.
Much of the credit for discovering the boson, or
"God particle," was given to British physicist
Peter Higgs, much to the chagrin of the Indian
government and people.
His father Surendranath was employed in
the Engineering Department of the East India
Railway. As a student of the Hindu High School,
Bose once was awarded 110 marks out of 100 in
mathematics because he had solved some
problems in the exam paper by more than one
method. He made a name for himself in school
due to his love for science; in collaboration with
some of his friends, he constructed a telescope
and other scientific instruments. 

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

Scientists at Europe's CERN research centre
have found a new subatomic particle that could
be the Higgs boson, the basic building block of
the universe. It is well known that the 'Higgs' of
Higgs boson refers to British physicist Peter
Higgs, who in 1964 laid much of the conceptual
groundwork for the presence of the elusive
particle. However, it's not exactly common
knowledge that the term "boson" owes its name
to the pioneering work of the late Indian
physicist, Satyendra Nath Bose.““Bose
completed his graduation from Presidency
College in Kolkata and Masters from Calcutta
University. He joined the Physics Department
of Calcutta University in 1916. After completing
his master's degree, Bose became a research
scholar at the University of Calcutta in 1916 and
began his studies on the theory of relativity. In
1921, Bose joined the physics department at the
University of Dhaka, which had then been
recently formed, and went on to establish new
departments, laboratories and libraries in which
he could teach advanced courses.
<br>
<br>
Bose, who worked in Kolkata and Dhaka,
was a contemporary of Albert Einstein. He made
important contributions to the field of quantum
physics in the 1920s that changed how particle
physics has been studied ever since.
Bose wrote a paper in 1924 in which he
derived Planck's quantum radiation law without
referencing classical physics—which he was able
to do by counting states with identical properties.
The paper would later prove seminal in creating
the field of quantum statistics.
In 1924, Bose sent the paper to Albert Einstein
in Germany, and the scientist recognized its
importance, translated it into German and
submitted it on Bose's behalf to the prestigious
scientific journal Zeitschrift für Physik. The
publication led to recognition, and Bose was
granted a leave of absence to work in Europe
for two years at X-ray and crystallography
laboratories, where he worked alongside Einstein
and Marie Curie, among others.
<br>
<br>
Einstein had adopted Bose's idea and
extended it to atoms, which led to the prediction
of the existence of phenomena that became
known as the Bose-Einstein Condensate, a dense
collection of bosons—particles with integer spin
that were named for Bose.
After his stay in Europe, Bose returned to the
University of Dhaka in 1926. Although he did
not have a doctorate, Einstein had recommended
he be made a professor, and so Bose was made
head of the physics department. But upon his
return, Bose did not publish for a significant
period of time.
<br>
<br>
According to a July 2012 New York Times
article in which Bose is described as the "Father
of the 'God Particle,'" the scientist's interests
wandered into other fields, including
philosophy, literature and the Indian
independence movement. He published another
physics paper in 1937 and in the early 1950s
worked on unified field theories.
After 25 years in Dhaka, Bose moved back
to Calcutta in 1945 and continued to research
and teach there until his death in 1974.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

The Government of India honored Bose in
1954 with the prestigious Padma Vibhushan, the
second-highest civilian award in India. Five years
later, he was appointed as the National Professor,
the highest honor in the country for a scholar.
Bose remained in that position for 15 years. Bose
also became an adviser to the Council of
Scientific and Industrial Research, as well as
president of the Indian Physical Society and the
National Institute of Science. He was elected
general president of the Indian Science Congress
and president of the Indian Statistical Institute.
In 1958, he became a Fellow of the Royal Society.
About 12 years after Bose's death on February
4, 1974, the Indian parliament established the
S.N. Bose National Centre for Basic Sciences in
Salt Lake, Kolkata.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PRAFULLA CHANDRA RAY</i></strong></div>

“Prafulla Chandra Ray was an eminent
scientist, an exemplary entrepreneur, a patriot
and a passionate teacher. Prafulla Chandra Ray
was the founder of the Indian School of modern
chemistry. He was a pioneer of chemical
industries in India. Ray’s activities were not
confined to his laboratory and teaching. His
activities concerned with all spheres of human
interest—educational reform, industrial
development, employment generation & poverty
alleviation, economic freedom and political
advancement of the country. He was a pioneer
in social reform in the country. He took to social
service with a missionary zeal. He was a great
critique of the prevailing caste system in the
Hindu society.
<br>
<br>
P C Ray was born on 2 August 1861 in RaruliKatipara, a village in the District of Khulna (in
present day Bangladesh). His early education
started in his village school. After attending the
village school, he went to Kolkata, where he
studied at Hare School and the Metropolitan
College. The lectures of Alexander Pedler in
the Presidency College, which he used to attend,
attracted him to chemistry, although his first love
was literature. He continued to take interest in
literature, and taught himself Latin and French
at home. After obtaining a F.A. diploma from
the University of Calcutta (now Kolkata), he
proceeded to the University of Edinburgh on a
Gilchrist scholarship where he obtained both his
B.Sc. and D.Sc. degrees.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

Prafulla Chandra Ray, one of the first Indian
chemical researchers, studied at the prestigious
Edinburgh University. After graduating from
university, he took a position as a Chemistry
Professor at the Presidency College in 1889.
Berthelot who was a very famous chemist,
helped and encouraged him with his admirable
research in Ayurveda.
<br>
<br>
In 1888, P C Ray made his journey home to
India. Initially he spent a year working with his
famous friend Jagadish Chandra Bose in
his laboratory. In 1889, Prafulla Chandra was
appointed an Assistant Professor of Chemistry
in the Presidency College, Kolkata. His
publications on mercurous nitrite and its
derivatives brought him recognition from all over
the world. Equally important was his role as a
teacher - he inspired a generation of young
chemists in India thereby building up an Indian
school of chemistry. Famous Indian scientists like
Meghnad Saha and Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar
were among his students.
In 1902, his research work of History of
Hindu Chemistry was published. P C Ray
believed that the progress of India could be
achieved only by industrialization. He set up the
first chemical factory in India, with very
minimal resources, working from his home. In
1901, this pioneering effort resulted in the
formation of the Bengal Chemical and
Pharmaceutical Works Ltd.
<br>
<br>
He retired from the Presidency College in
1916, and was appointed as Professor of
Chemistry at the University Science College. In
1921 when P C Ray reached 60 years, he
donated, in advance, all his salary for the rest of
his service in the University to the development
of the Department of Chemistry and to the
creation of two research fellowships. The value
of this endowment was about two lakh rupees.
He eventually retired at the age of 75. In 1936
Ray retired from his service in the University
College of Science but he continued as Emeritus
Professor of Chemistry till his death. He got
elected as the Indian Science Congress President
in 1920.
<br>
<br>
In P C Ray, the qualities of both a scientist
and an industrial entrepreneur were combined
and he can be thought of as the father of the
Indian Pharmaceutical industry. P C Ray died
on June 16, 1944 in his living room in the
University College of Science of the Calcutta
University.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PROF. PRASANTA CHANDRA
MAHALANOBIS</i></strong></div>

Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis was a great
scientist and applied statistician. He is famous
for the ‘Mahalanobis Distance’, a statistical
measure. He did pioneering work on
anthropometric variation in India. Professor
Mahalanobis made valuable contributions to the
development of statistical science in India.
Scientist P.C. Mahalanobis was born on June
29, 1893 and died on June 28, 1972. He was the
son of Prabodh Chandra and Nirodbasini. His
father was an active member of the Sadharan
Brahmo Samaj. He started education from
Brahmo Boys School in Calcutta (now Kolkata).
Then he completed graduation in physics from
the Presidency College, Calcutta in 1912. He also
completed Tripos at King’s College, Cambridge.
After that he came back to Calcutta, India, and
here he was introduced to the Principal of
Presidency College and was invited to take
classes in physics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

Prof. Mahalanobis's first paper on statistics
entitled 'Anthropological Observations on AngloIndians of Calcutta, Part I: Male Stature',
published in Records of the Indian Museum in
1922. This paper attracted the attention of Sir
Gilbert Walker, Director General of
Observatories, who requested Mahalanobis to
undertake a systematic study of some
metrological problems. This resulted in an
important discovery by Mahalanobis that the
region of highest control for changes in weather
on the surface of the earth is located about 4
kilometers above sea-level. Subsequently, he was
appointed Meteorologist in the Alipore
Observatory and he held this post from 1922 to
1926.
<br>
<br>
At the request of the Indian Government,
Mahalanobis undertook some work on
prevention of floods in various regions of the
country. His findings and recommendations,
though often contrary to engineering wisdom
of the time, were accepted by the Government
and resulted in alleviation of the problem of
flooding to a large extent.
<br>
<br>
Lasting Gift to Statistics:
Mahalanobis's contributions to large scale
sample surveys are among his most significant
and lasting gifts to statistics. He stared his work
on sample surveys with estimation of area and
yield of jute crop in Bengal in 1937.
He made many methodological contributions
to survey sampling that included optimal choice
of sampling design using variance and cost
functions, and the technique of interpenetrating
network of subsamples for assessment and
control of errors, especially non-sampling errors,
in surveys. The concept of pilot surveys was a
forerunner of sequential sampling developed by
Abraham Wald, as acknowledged by Wald in
his book. In addition to introducing these
concepts, Mahalanobis raised important and
difficult philosophical questions on randomness
and representativeness of a sample, which
remain relevant and challenging even today.
He was elected Chairman of the United
Nations Subcommission on Statistical Sampling
in 1947, and held the post till 1951. His tireless
advocation of the usefulness of sample surveys
resulted in the final recommendation of this
subcommission that sampling methods should
be extended to all parts of the world.
Mahalanobis received the Weldon Medal from
Oxford University in 1944 and was elected a
Fellow of the Royal Society, London, in 1945,
for his fundamental contributions to Statistics,
particularly in the area of large-scale sample
surveys.
<br>
<br>
Plans for Economic Prosperity of Nation:
Mahalanobis believed that statistics should
be an integral part of the dynamics of national
planning. He was acutely aware of national
problems and national resources. He took a keen
interest and played a key role in formulating
India's second five-year plan based on 
the foursector model developed by him. Broad sectoral
allocations of employment, capital investment
and increment in national income were worked
out and then split into detailed targets. Even
though national planning seems to have now
gone out of fashion, the need for planning in the
initial stages of a nation's development is still
acknowledged and Mahalanobis's contributions
to Indian national planning continue to be held
in high esteem by economists.
<br>
<br>
During the last decade of his life, he devised
a statistical method, fractile graphical analysis,
for comparison of socio-economic conditions of
groups of people. This technique has now been
used in many other branches of science.
ISI as an Institution of National Importance:
The year 1931 marks a watershed in the
development of statistics in India. From the
fledgling Statistical Laboratory formed in the
early 1920s by Mahalanobis within the Physics
department of Presidency College, he founded
the Indian Statistical Institute on 17 December,
1931. In 1959, by an act of the Indian Parliament,
the Institute was declared as an 'Institution of
National Importance'.
<br>
<br>
Statistical System in India:
Mahalanobis's role as a planner prompted
him to play a pioneering role in the organized
collection of official statistics. He established the
National Sample Survey in 1950 with the
objective of providing comprehensive statistics
relating to all economic and social aspects on an
all-India basis. He also helped in setting up of
the Central Statistical Organization in India, an
apex body for coordination of statistical activities
in India. He was instrumental in the
establishment of formal teaching of statistics in
many Indian universities and also in the Indian
Statistical Institute. In collaboration with the
International Statistical Institute, he established
an International Statistical Education Centre at
the Indian Statistical Institute.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Mahalanobis became the Honorary President
of the International Statistical Institute in 1957,
and was elected a fellow of the American
Statistical Association in 1961. Throughout his
career he received many other academic honours
and awards. He received the highest national
honour, Padma Vibhushan, from the President
of India in 1968 for his contribution to science
and services to the country.
<br>
<br>
He had appointed as the Honorary Statistical
Advisor to the cabinet of the Government of
India. He had Weldon medal from Oxford
University in 1944. He was also elected a fellow
of the Royal Society, London in 1945.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SIR C. V. RAMAN</i></strong></div>

Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was a
great Physicist of India born on November 7th,
1888, in a small village of Thiruvanaikaval near
Tiruchirapalli (Trichonopoly in those days),
Tamil Nadu. His father was a lecturer in
mathematics and physics so that from the first
he was immersed in an academic atmosphere.
He entered Presidency College, Madras (now
Chennai), in 1902, and in 1904 passed his B.A.
examination, winning the first place and the gold
medal in physics; in 1907 he gained his M.A.
degree, obtaining the highest distinctions.“
<br>
<br>
<b>Contributions and Achievements:</b>
C. V. Raman earliest researches in optics and
acoustics - the two fields of investigation to which
he has dedicated his entire career - were carried
out while he was a student. Since at that time a
scientific career did not appear to present the
best possibilities, Raman joined the Indian
Finance Department in 1907; though the duties
of his office took most of his time, Raman found
opportunities for carrying on experimental
research in the laboratory of the Indian
Association for the Cultivation of Science at
Calcutta (now Kolkata).
<br>
<br>
In 1917 he was offered the newly endowed
Palit Chair of Physics at Calcutta University, and
decided to accept it. After 15 years at Calcutta
he became Professor at the Indian Institute of
Science at Bangalore (1933-1948), and since 1948
he is Director of the Raman Institute of Research
at Bangalore, established and endowed by
himself. He also founded the Indian Journal of
Physics in 1926, of which he is the Editor. Raman
sponsored the establishment of the Indian
Academy of Sciences and has served as
President since its inception. He also initiated
the Proceedings of that academy, in which much
of his work has been published, and is President
of the Current Science Association, Bangalore,
which publishes Current Science (India).
<br>
<br>
Raman made many major scientific
discoveries in acoustics, ultrasonic, optics,
magnetism and crystal physics. Raman's works
on the musical drums of India was epoch-making
and it revealed the acoustical knowledge of the
ancient Hindus. It may be noted here that it was
Pythagoras who first formulated what makes a
sound musical to the human ear.
Some of Raman's early memoirs appeared as
Bulletins of the Indian Association for the
Cultivation of Science (Bull. 6 and 11, dealing with
the "Maintenance of Vibrations"; Bull. 15, 1918,
dealing with the theory of the musical
instruments of the violin family). He contributed
an article on the theory of musical instruments
to the 8th Volume of the Handbuch der Physik,
1928.
<br>
<br>
In 1922 he published his work on the
"Molecular Diffraction of Light", the first of a
series of investigations with his collaborators
which ultimately led to his discovery, on the 28th
of February, 1928, of the radiation effect which
bears his name and which gained him the 1930
Nobel Prize in Physics.“Other investigations
carried out by Raman were: his experimental
and theoretical studies on the diffraction of light
by acoustic waves of ultrasonic and hypersonic
frequencies (published 1934-1942), and those on
the effects produced by X-rays on infrared
vibrations in crystals exposed to ordinary light.
In 1948 Raman, through studying the
spectroscopic behaviour of crystals, approached
in a new manner fundamental problems of
crystal dynamics. His laboratory has been
dealing with the structure and properties of
diamond, the structure and optical behaviour of
numerous iridescent substances (labradorite,
pearly felspar, agate, opal, and pearls).
Raman developed a vibrant and excellent
school of physics. He established the Indian
Academy of Sciences Bangalore (1934) and the
Raman Research Institute (1948). Among his
other interests have been the optics of colloids,
electrical and magnetic anisotropy, and the
physiology of human vision. Sir C.V. Raman
died on November 21, 1970.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Raman was honoured with a large number
of honorary doctorates and memberships of
scientific societies. Raman was elected as a
Fellow of the Royal Society of London in 1924 in
recognition of his outstanding researches in
physical optics, molecular diffraction of light, Xray scattering by liquids and a molecular
anisotropy. It may be noted that Raman had
resigned the Fellowship of the Royal Society. He
was conferred a Knighthood by the British
Government in 1929. In 1941 he was awarded
the Franklin Medal. The erstwhile Soviet Union
honoured him with the International Lenin Prize
in 1957.
<br>
<br>
In 1930, C. V. Raman was the first `nonwhite', Asian and Indian to receive the Nobel
prize in physics for his work on scattering of light
and discovery of the Raman effect. In 1954 the
Government of India awarded him the title of
the Bharat Ratna. India celebrates National
Science Day on 28 February of every year to
commemorate the discovery of the Raman Effect
in 1928.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>JAGADISH CHANDRA BOSE</i></strong></div>

Jagadish Chandra Bose was an Indian
scientist who discovered and proved in the world
that plants also have life. They consume food
and sleep during nights, and wake up early in
the mornings. Pain and pleasures are there for
plants too. They also have birth, growth and
death, as human beings. He is regarded as India’s
first modern scientist. Jagadis Chandra Bose was
born on 30th November 1858 in Mymensingh,
now in Bangladesh.
<br>
<br>
He had his early education in St. Xavier’s
High School, and college education in Calcutta
(now Kolkata) and later at Cambridge, England.
He joined the Presidency College, Calcutta as
Assistant Professor of Physics in 1855.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

J. C. Bose is one of the most prominent first
Indian scientists who proved by experimentation
that both animals and plants share much in
common. Bose demonstrated that plant tissues
under different kinds of stimuli like mechanical,
application of heat, cold, light, noise, electric
shock, chemicals and drugs, produce electric
response similar to that produced by animal
tissues. He also tried to demonstrate that similar
electric response to stimulation could be noticed
in certain inorganic systems. For his
investigations Bose invented several novel and
highly sensitive instruments. Among these the
most important one was the Crescograph -an
instrument for measuring the growth of a plant.
It could record a growth as small as 1/100,000
inch per second.
<br>
<br>
Bose’s experiments on plants were mostly
performed on Minosa pudica and Desmondium
gyrans (Indian Telegraph plant). His findings
subsequently influenced subjects like physiology,
chronobiology, cybernetics, medicine and
agriculture.
Bose did pioneering research, first in physics
and then in physiology. In 1888 Heinrich Rudolf
Hertz (1857-94) produced and detected
electromagnetic waves in the 60 cm wavelength
range and in doing so he verified James Clerk
Maxwell’s (1831-79) electromagnetic theory.
However, Bose was the first to produce
millimeter-length radio waves and study their
properties. Bose was a pioneer in microwave
optics technology. He was the first to show that
semiconductor rectifiers could detect radio
waves. Bose’s galena receiver was amongst the
earliest examples of a lead sulphide photo
conducting device.
<br>
<br>
Bose devised and fabricated a new type of
radiator for generating radio waves. He also built
a unique and highly sensitive ‘Coherer’ or radio
receiver for detecting radio waves. Bose’s coherer
was far more compact, efficient and effective
than the ones used in Europe. On 29 March 1904
he became the first Indian to get a US patent,
for his "detector for electrical disturbances".
He also demonstrated a new type of radio
waves as small as 1 centimeter to 5 millimeters.
Such waves are now called microwaves, and are
used in radars, ground telecommunication,
satellite communication, remote sensing and
microwave ovens. In May 1895, he read his first
research paper before the Asiatic Society of
Bengal ‘On the polarisation of Electric Rays by
Double Reflecting Crystals”. In the same year
one of his papers titled “On the Determination
of the Indices of Refraction of Sulphur for the
Electric Ray” was communicated to the Royal
Society of London by Lord Rayleigh.
<br>
<br>
J. C. Bose was sent to England to get enrolled
into Indian Civil Service. He took interest in
Botany and Zoology. J. C. Bose, as Assistant
Professor and researcher in Physics discovered
the following:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Generation of electro-magnetic waves of
wavelengths 2mm to 5 mm</li>
        <li>Common nature of electric response to
all forms of stimulation.</li>
        <li>He was the first to find a device that
generated micro-waves of very short
wavelength.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
J. C. Bose attained his greatness in the field
of Botany. He was the author of the world
famous books.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Response in the Living and Non-living</li>
        <li>The Nervous Mechanism of Plants</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

In 1903 Bose was honoured with
Commander of the Order of the Indian Empire
(CIE) at Delhi by the British Government. He
received in 1912 the Commander of the Star of
India (CSI) at the Coronation of the British
Emperor. He was knighted by the British
Government in 1916. Bose was elected a fellow
of the Royal Society (FRS) of London in 1928.
Bose died on 23 November 1937. He was the
member of the Vienna Academy of Sciences,
1928 and President of the 14th session of the
Indian Science Congress in 1927.
The 230-year-old Indian Botanic Garden,
Kolkata was renamed as the Acharya Jagadish
Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden in June
2009 in honour of J.C. Bose.

satellite, ‘Aryabhatta’. He is considered as the
‘Father of the Indian Space Programme’. Vikram
Ambalal Sarabhai had devoted their entire life
to the progress of science in our country.
Sarabhai's name will remain inseparable
from India's space programme. It was Sarabhai
who put India on the international map in the
field of space research. But then he made equally
pioneering contributions in other fields. He
worked in the fields of textiles, pharmaceuticals,
nuclear power, electronics and many others
incessantly till last.
<br>
<br>
Vikram Sarabhai was born on August 12,
1919 at Ahmedabad, Gujarat to Shri Ambalal
Sarabhai and Smt. Sarladevi Sarabhai, in a
family of Industrialists. His father Ambalal
Sarabhai was an affluent industrialist and
owned many mills in Gujarat.
He had his early education in a private
school. Here the prevent atmosphere injected
into the young by the seeds of scientific curiosity,
ingenuity and creativity. From this school he
proceeded to Cambridge for his college
education and took the tripods degree from St.
John’s College in 1940. When World War II
began, he returned home and joined as a
research scholar under Sir C.V. Raman at the
IISc, Bangalore. In September, 1942 Vikram
Sarabhai married Mrinalini Sarabhai who was
a celebrated classical dancer of India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

Vikram Sarabhai started his work on cosmic
rays and built the necessary equipment with
which he took measurements. He returned to
Cambridge in 1945. In 1947 he was awarded
the Ph. D. degree. The Physical Research
Laboratory (PRL) was established in November
1947 in a few rooms in M.G. Science Institute of
the Ahmedabad Education Society, which was
founded by his parents. Subsequently, it got
support from the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR) and the Department
of Atomic Energy.
<br>
<br>
Establishing Physical Research Laboratory
His interest in solar physics and cosmic rays
led him to set up many observation stations
around the country. Vikram Sarabhai
established centers for scientific research in
several places of India. He was instrumental in
establishing the Physical Research Laboratory
(PRL) in Ahmedabad. In this, he formed the
‘Group for the Improvement of Science
Education’, in 1963. In the same year, he
established the Nehru Foundation for
Development, for the study of social and
education problems.
<br>
<br>
In 1966, under its auspices, he established
the Community Science Center, whose object
was to spread scientific knowledge, to create
interest in science and to promote
experimentation among students, teachers and
the general public. After the sudden death of
Dr. Sarabhai in 1971, the then Prime Minister
of India, Smt. Indira Gandhi, renamed the
Centre as the Vikram A. Sarabhai Community
Science Centre, to associate its name with that
of its founder.
To train efficient managers of factories, he
started the Indian Institute of Management (IIM)
at Ahmedabad. Of all the institutions, he
established the most important were the ‘Indian
Space Research Organization’ with Centers at
Thumba, Ahmedabad, Shriharikota and Arvi.
He established Rocket Launching Stations at
Thumba and Shrihatikota. Along with his work
on the science front, he took utmost interest and
managed family business of Textiles and
Pharmaceuticals.
<br>
<br>
He was also responsible for the Equatorial
Rocket Building Station at Thumba. Sarabhai set
up the Ahmedabad Textile Industries Research
Association, a laboratory for research in physics
and the Indian Institute of Management.
Effect of solar activity on cosmic rays
Sarabhai’s study of cosmic rays under the
eminent scientist Dr. C.V.Raman revealed that
cosmic rays are a stream of energy particles
reaching the earth from the outer space, being
influenced on their way by the sun, the
atmosphere and magnetism. This study helps in
observing terrestrial magnetism and the
atmosphere, the nature of the sun and outer
space.
<br>
<br>
By collecting and analysing his own
observations as well as those of other scientists,
Sarabhai's team concluded that meteorological
effects could not entirely affect the observed daily
variations of cosmic rays; further, the residual
variations were wide and global and these were
related to variations in solar activity.
In the observed cosmic ray anisotropies were
to be regarded as modulation effect to the solar
wind, then Sarabhai could visualize a new field
of research opening up in solar and
interplanetary Physics.
The first opportunity came in 1957-58 during
the International Geo-physical year (IGY). The
Indian program for the IGY had been one of the
most significant ventures of Sarabhai. It exposed
him to the new vistas of space science with the
launching in 1957 of Sputnik-I. Subsequently,
the Indian National Committee for Space
Research was created, of which Sarabhai became
Chairman.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Soaring to Space</i></strong></div>

The establishment of the Indian Space
Research Organisation (ISRO) was one of his
greatest achievements. He successfully convinced
the government to the importance of a space
programme for a developing country like India
after the Russian Sputnik launch.
Rocket Launching Station: Dr. Homi Jehangir
Bhabha, supported Dr. Sarabhai in setting up
the first rocket launching station in India. The
Rocket Launching station (TERLS) was
established at Thumba near Thiruvananthapuram on the coast of the Arabian Sea, primarily
because of its proximity to the equator. After a
remarkable effort in setting up the infrastructure,
personnel, communication links, and launch
pads, the inaugural flight was launched on
November 21, 1963 with a sodium vapour
payload.
<br>
<br>
To implement the space programme,
Sarabhai took the following steps during 1961-
1966. Expanding PRL and making it the
headquarters for Space activities. Setting up the
Space Science and Technology Center at Thumba
for creating fabrication, testing and other
auxiliary facilities. Establishing an Experimental
Satellite Communication Earth Station at
Ahmedabad.
<br>
<br>
In 1965, the UN General Assembly gave
recognition to TERLS as an international facility.
With the sudden death of Homi Bhabha in an
air crash, Sarabhai was appointed Chairman,
Atomic Energy Commission in May 1966.
As a result of Dr. Sarabhai’s dialogue with
NASA in 1966, the Satellite Instructional
Television Experiment (SITE) was launched
during July 1975-July 1976 (when Dr. Sarabhai
was no more). Dr. Sarabhai started a project for
the fabrication and launch of an Indian Satellite.
As a result, the first Indian satellite, Aryabhatta,
was put in orbit in 1975 from a Russian
Cosmodrome. This development furthers the
indigenous capability for satellite launching from
low-orbiting to synchronous levels.
Like Bhabha, Sarabhai wanted the practical
application of science to reach the common man.
Thus he saw a golden opportunity to harness
space science to the development of the country
in the fields of communication, meteorology,
remote sensing and education. Vikram Sarabhai
died at the age of 52 on December 31, 1971 at
Kovalam, Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala.
Some of the most well-known institutions
established by Sarabhai are :-

<br>
<br>
Sarabhai was the second chairman of India’s
Atomic Energy Commission and the Indian
Space Research Organization (ISRO). He was
conferred ‘Padma Vibhushan’ in 1972. He was
also awarded ‘Dr. Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar
Medal in Physics’ in 1962.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>PROF. SATISH DHAWAN</i></strong></div>

Prof. Satish Dhawan was an Indian rocket
scientist who was born on September 25, 1920,
in Srinagar, India. He is considered by the Indian
scientific community to be the father of
experimental fluid dynamics research in India
and one of the most eminent researchers in the
field of turbulence and boundary layers. “His
father was a high-ranking civil servant of
undivided India and retired as the resettlement
Commissioner of Government of India at the
time of partition. He completed graduation from
the University of Punjab in Lahore, Pakistan. He
also completed B.A. in Mathematics and physics,
and M.A. in English Literature and a B.E. in
Mechanical Engineering. In 1947, he obtained
an M.S. in Aeronautical Engineering from the
University of Minnesota. Later, he moved to the
California Institute of Technology, where he was
awarded the Aeronautical Engineer’s Degree in
1949, and a Ph. D in Aeronautical and
Mathematics in 1951, which he pursued with
eminent aerospace scientist Professor Hans W.
Liepmann as adviser.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

After completion of education he joined the
Indian Institute of Science in 1951 and became
its Director in 1962. In 1972, he was appointed
Chairman of the Space Commission and of the
Indian Space Commission and of the Indian
Space Research Organization (ISRO), and
Secretary to the Government of India in the
Department of Space. In the following decade,
he directed the Indian space programme through
a period of extraordinary growth and
spectacular achievement. Major Programmes
were carefully defined and systematically
executed, including in particular the launch of
Indian satellites on Indian rocket vehicles.
Even while he was the head of the Indian
space programme, he devoted substantial efforts
towards boundary layer research. His most
important contributions are presented in the
seminal book Boundary Layer Theory by
Hermann Schlichting. “He was a popular
professor at the Indian Institute of Science, (IISc)
located in Bangalore. He is credited for setting
up the first supersonic wind tunnel in India at
IISc. He also pioneered research on
relaminarization of separated boundary layer
flows, three-dimensional boundary layers and
trisonic flows.
<br>
<br>
Prof. Satish Dhawan carried out pioneering
experiments in rural education, remote sensing
and satellite communications. His efforts led to
operational systems like INSAT- a
telecommunications satellite, IRS - the Indian
Remote Sensing satellite and the Polar Satellite
Launch Vehicle (PSLV) that placed India in the
league of space faring nations.
These projects were all distinguished by their
keen sensitivity to the true needs of a developing
nation, a confident appreciation of the ability of
its scientists and engineers, and the carefully
planned involvement of Indian space
programme came to be seen in the 1980s as a
model of technology development and
application carried out within the country.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Following the death of Prof. Satish Dhawan
on January 3, 2002, the Indian satellite launch
centre at Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, located
about 100 km north of Chennai in South India
was renamed as the Prof. Satish Dhawan Space
Centre.
Prof. Satish Dhawan received many awards
for his contribution to science and technology,

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SUBRAHMANYAN CHANDRASEKHAR</i></strong></div>

The ‘Nobel Laureate’ in physics
Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was one of the
greatest scientists of the 20th century became a
legend in his life time. He was a great scientist,
an accomplished teacher and a formidable
scholar. Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar was
born in Lahore on October 19, 1910. His father
C. Subrahmanyan Iyer was in Government
Service.
<br>
<br>
C.V. Raman, the first Indian to get Nobel
Prize in science was the younger brother of
Chandrasekhar's father. Chandrasekhar grew
up in Madras (now Chennai). He went to a
regular school when he was eleven. He joined
the Madras Presidency College in 1925 where
in the first two years he studied Physics,
Chemistry, English and Sanskrit. On July 31,
1930 Chandrasekhar left for England for higher
studies and thus began a long and outstanding
scientific career which spanned 65 years. Except
for the first six years he worked at the University
of Chicago.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

Chandrasekhar was renowned for his work
in the field of stellar evolution, and in the early
1930s, he was the first to theorise that a
collapsing massive star would become an object
so dense that not even light could escape it, now
known as the Black hole. He demonstrated that
there is an upper limit (known as
‘Chandrasekhar Limit’) to the mass of a White
dwarf star. His theory challenged the common
scientific notion of the 1930s that all stars, after
burning up their fuel, became faint, planer-sized
remmants known as white dwarfs. But today,
the extremely dense neutron stars and black holes
implied by Chandrasekhar’s early work are a
central part of the field of astrophysics.
He is best known for his celebrated discovery
of Chandrasekhar Limit. He showed that there
is a maximum mass which can be supported
against gravity by pressure made up of electrons
and atomic nuclei. The value of this limit is about
1.44 times a solar mass. This was derived by
Chandrasekhar in 1930, when he was a student.
The Chandrasekhar Limit plays a crucial role in
understanding the stellar evolution. If the mass
of a star exceeded this limit, the star would not
become a white dwarf. It would continue to
collapse under the extreme pressure of
gravitational forces. The formulation of the
Chandrasekhar Limit led to the discovery of
neutron stars and black holes. It may be noted
that stars are stable, that is they do not collapse
because internal pressures (due to the thermal
motion of the atomic nuclei and electrons and
also the pressure of the radiation generated by
nuclear reactions) balance gravity.
However, for every star a time will come
when nuclear reactions will cease and that
means there will be no internal pressure to match
the gravitational pull. Depending on the mass
there are three possible final stages of a star -
white dwarf, neutron star and black hole.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Chandrasekhar was awarded (jointly with
the nuclear astrophysicist W.A. Fowler) the
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1983. While
Chandrasekhar is best known for
Chandrasekhar Limit, for him there was no limit.
His work spanned physics, astrophysics and
applied mathematics.
The genius Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar,
known to the world as Chandra, died on August
21, 1995 in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DR. HAR GOBIND KHORANA</i></strong></div>

Har Gobind Khorana was born on January
9th, 1922 in Raipur, Punjab, which is now part
of eastern Pakistan. He is the youngest of a family
of one daughter and four sons. His father was a
‘patwari’, a village agricultural taxation clerk in
the British Indian system of government.
Har Gobind Khorana did his schooling from
the D.A.V. High School in Multan (now West
Punjab, Pakistan). Later, he studied at the Punjab
University in Lahore where he obtained an M.
Sc. degree.
<br>
<br>
Khorana lived in India until 1945, when the
award of a Government of India Fellowship
made it possible for him to go to England and he
studied for a Ph. D. degree at the University of
Liverpool. Roger J. S. Beer supervised his
research, and, in addition, looked after him
diligently. It was the introduction of Khorana to
Western civilization and culture.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

Khorana spent a postdoctoral year (1948-
1949) at the Eidgenössische Technische
Hochschule in Zurich with Professor Vladimir
Prelog. The association with Professor Prelog
molded immeasurably his thought and
philosophy towards science, work, and effort.
After a brief period in India in the fall of 1949,
Khorana returned to England where he obtained
a fellowship to work with Professor G. W.
Kenner and Lord A.R. Todd. He stayed in
Cambridge from 1950 till 1952. Again, this stay
proved to be of decisive value to Khorana.
Interest in both proteins and nucleic acids took
root at that time.““A job offer in 1952 from Dr.
Gordon M. Shrum of the University of British
Columbia took him to Vancouver. The British
Columbia Research Council offered at that time
very little by way of facilities, but there was ‘all
the freedom in the world’ to do what the
researcher liked to do.
<br>
<br>
During the following years, with Dr. Shrum's
inspiration and encouragement and frequent
help and scientific counsel from Dr. Jack
Campbell, a group began to work in the field of
biologically interesting phosphate esters and
nucleic acids. Among the many devoted and
loyal colleagues of this period, there should, in
particular, be mention of Professor Gordon M.
Tener, who contributed much to the spiritual
and intellectual well-being of the group.““In
1960 Khorana moved to the Institute for Enzyme
Research at the University of Wisconsin. He
became a naturalized citizen of the United States.
As of the fall of 1970 Khorana was appointed
Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Biology and
Chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Har Gobind Khorana shared the Nobel
Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with
Marshall Nirenberg and Robert Holley for
cracking the genetic code. They established that
this code, the biological language common to all
living organisms, is spelled out in three-letter
words: each set of three nucleotides codes for a
specific amino acid. Dr. Khorana was also
the first to synthesize oligonucleotides (strings of
nucleotides). Today, oligonucleotides are
indispensable tools in biotechnology, widely used
in biology labs for sequencing, cloning and
genetic engineering.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Dr. Har Gobind Khorana shared the Nobel
Prize for Medicine and Physiology in 1968 with

has won many awards and honors for his
achievements, amongst them the Padma
Vibhushan, Membership of the National
Academy of Sciences, USA as well as a Fellow
of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. H. Gobind Khorana
died on 9 November 2011.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>HOMI JEHANGIR BHABHA</i></strong></div>

Homi Jehangir Bhabha is mostly known as
the chief architect of India's nuclear programme.
Homi Jehangir Bhabha was a multifaceted
personality - scientist, visionary and institution
builder. He was born on October 30, 1909 in a
Parsi family of Bombay (now Mumbai).
After finishing schooling, Bhabha’s parents
sent him to Cambridge University, UK for higher
education in mechanical engineering. In 1930,
Bhabha completed mechanical engineering in
first class and stay for the degree in physics. After
completing his degree in 1932, Bhabha
continued his research at Cambridge University.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

Bhabha’s first paper appeared in 1934, based
on theoretical explanation of shower production
in cosmic rays. His name is associated with
Bhabha scattering, which involves relativistic
exchange scattering of electrons and BhabhaHeitler theory, dealing with production of
electron and positron showers in cosmic rays.
Thus, it was no surprise that at an young age of
31, he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society,
London. Bhabha rubbed shoulders with great
physicists like Bohr, Pauli, Dirac, Cockcroft and
others, who later became Noble Laureates.
 Bhabha was on vacation during 1939, when
the second world war broke out and he could
not go back abroad to continue his research. He
then joined Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
as a Reader in Department of Physics, headed
by Sir C. V. Raman and set up a cosmic ray
research unit.
<br>
<br>
In 1944, Bhabha wrote his historical letter to
the Tata trust for support in setting up a centre
for research work in nuclear science, which
could play a central role in the development of
nuclear energy. This was just two years after
1942, when the first experimental demonstration
of nuclear reactor was made in USA.
All the more so, the country was still under
the British rule and industrially undeveloped.
There was a clear similarity in vision between
the great Jamshedji Nusserwanji Tata and
Bhabha with respect to the need for education,
scientific research and human resource
development for economic prosperity. Based on
this letter, Tata Trust supported him to set up a
laboratory at Kenilworth, Bombay. Subsequently,
Tata Institute of Fundamental Research was
formed and large scale research in physics,
chemistry, electronics and mathematics
commenced. Thus, Bhabha had converted the
difficulty of not going back abroad to a great
opportunity of setting up of front ranking
research facilities within the country.
<br>
<br>
Creation of Atomic Energy Commission:
 Bhabha was instrumental for the formation
of Atomic Energy Commission in 1948 and the
Department of Atomic Energy in 1954 and he
chalked out a focussed research and minerals
exploration programmes for nuclear energy. He
was such a visionary that he had realized the
importance of nuclear power programme way
back in 1950s and enunciated a three stage
nuclear programme so as to meet the energy
security of the nation. It consisted of utilization
of natural uranium, plutonium and abundant
thorium resources in thermal, fast and advanced
nuclear reactors with closed fuel cycle.
He also had balanced perspective on the role
of other energy resources such as coal, oil and
solar. A significant factor that contributed for
the growth of nuclear sciences and its
applications was Bhabha's rapport with the then
Prime Minister Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, who
reposed complete confidence in him. This was
possible because Bhabha had the deserving
credentials and his passion matched with
Nehru’s vision of modern India. There was a
great synergy in thinking between Nehru and
Bhabha with respect to industrialization and
scientific research, evolving hand-in-hand.
 Bhabha gave utmost importance to the
development of quality human resources. The
commencement and continuation of BARC
Training School for the scientific manpower over
the last 50 years is a real tribute to Bhabha’s
foresight on quality manpower.
Bhabha, a person of perfection, purpose and
excellence, ensured these qualities in all his
endeavours viz., research, management,
buildings and environment. Bhabha was a great
scientific manager and followed the mantra of
right man for the right job.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Bhabha had received many prestigious
national and international awards and
recognitions. In 1954, he was conferred
with Padma Bhushan award for outstanding
contributions to nuclear science. In 1955, he was
elected as the President of the first International
Conference on the 'Peaceful Uses of Atomic
Energy', organized by the UN at Geneva.
At a young age of 56, Bhabha suddenly
passed away in 1966 due to a plane crash in
Switzerland.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SRINIVASA RAMANUJAN</i></strong></div>

Srinivasa Ramanujan, Indian mathematician, whose contributions to the theory of
numbers includes pioneering discoveries of the
properties of the partition function. Srinivasa
Ramanujan Aiyangar was an Indian
Mathematician who was born in Erode, Tamil
Nadu on December 22, 1887. Ramanujan is very
well known for his efforts on continued fractions
and series of hypergeometry. When Ramanujan
was thirteen, he could work out Loney’s
Trigonometry exercises without any help. At the
fourteen, he was able to acquire the theorems of
cosine and sine given by L. Euler. Synopsis of
Elementary Results in Pure and Applied
Mathematics by George Shoobridge Carr was
reached by him in 1903. The book helped him a
lot and opened new dimensions to him which
helped him introduce about 6,165 theorems for
himself.
<br>
<br>
As he had no proper and good books in his
reach, he had to figure out on his own the
solutions for all the questions. It was in this quest
that he discovered many tremendous methods
and new algebraic series.
In 1904, he received a merit scholarship in a
local college and became more indulgent into
mathematics. He lost his interest in all other
subjects due to which he lost his scholarship.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

In 1911 Ramanujan published the first of his
papers in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical
Society. His genius slowly gained recognition,
and in 1913 he began a correspondence with the
British mathematician Godfrey H. Hardy that led
to a special scholarship from theUniversity of
Madras and a grant from Trinity College,
Cambridge. Ramanujan traveled to England in
1914, where Hardy tutored him and collaborated
with him in some research.
<br>
<br>
Hardy said Ramanujan could have become
an outstanding mathematician if his skills had
been recognized earlier. It was said about his
talents of continued fractions and
hypergeometric series that, “he was
unquestionably one of the great masters.” It was
due to his sharp memory, calculative mind,
patience and insight that he was a great formalist
of his days. But it was due to his some methods
of working in the work analysis and theories of
numbers that did not let him excel that much.
Ramanujan’s knowledge of mathematics
(most of which he had worked out for himself)
was startling. Although almost completely
ignorant of what had been developed, his
mastery of continued fractions was unequaled
by any living mathematician. He worked out the
Riemann series, the elliptic integrals,
hypergeometric series, the functional equations
of the zeta function, and his own theory of
divergent series. On the other hand, the gaps in
his knowledge were equally startling. He knew
nothing of doubly periodic functions, the
classical theory of quadratic forms, or Cauchy’s
theorem, and had only the most nebulous idea
of what constitutes a mathematical proof.
In England, Ramanujan made further
advances, especially in the partition of numbers.
His papers were published in English and
European journals, and in 1918 he became the
first Indian to be elected to the Royal Society of
London.
<br>
<br>
Ramanujan published some of his results in
journals, and many are beautiful indeed.
However, his working notebooks contained
much additional unorganized material which
remained uninvestigated until the sustained
efforts of Berndt and his coworkers who
systematically examined and proved
Ramanujan's sometimes vague or ambiguous
statements. For anyone with a little knowledge
of number theory, Ramanujan's notebooks make
absolutely fascinating reading. It is therefore a
great pity that their publisher, Springer-Verlag,
has chosen to price these slim volumes at the
ridiculous price of about $100 apiece.
Srinivasa Ramanujan hailed as an all-time
great mathematician, like Euler, Gauss or Jacobi,
for his natural genius, has left behind 4000
original theorems, despite his lack of formal
education and a short life-span.
<br>
<br>
Hardy–Ramanujan number:
The number 1729 is known as the Hardy–
Ramanujan number after a famous anecdote of
the British mathematician G.H. Hardy regarding
a visit to the hospital to see Ramanujan. Hardy
said ‘’I remember once going to see him when
he was ill. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729
and remarked that the number seemed to me
rather a dull one, and that I hoped it was not an
unfavorable omen. "No," he replied, "it is a very
interesting number; it is the smallest number
expressible as the sum of two cubes in two
different ways."
The two different ways are:
1729 = 13+123=93+103.
<br>
<br>
Generalizations of this idea have created the
notion of "taxicab numbers". Coincidentally,
1729 is also a Carmichael number.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

He got elected as the fellow in 1918 at the
Trinity College at Cambridge and the Royal
Society. He died on April 26, 1920.
On the 125th anniversary of his birth,
Government of India declared the birthday of
Ramanujan, December 22, as 'National
Mathematics Day' and the year 2012 celebrated
as the National Mathematics Year.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MEGHNAD SAHA</i></strong></div>

Meghnad Saha was a great Indian scientist.
He made remarkable contribution to the field of
Astrophysics. He put forward an “ionization
formula” which explained the presence of the
spectral lines. Meghnad Saha belonged to a poor
family and struggled to rise in life. He was born
in Seoratali, Dacca district, now in Bangladesh,
on October 6, 1893.
<br>
<br>
Meghnad Saha took admission in the
Kishorilal Jubilee School and passed the Entrance

standing first among the student from East
Bengal obtaining the highest marks in languages
(English, Bengali and Sanskrit combined) and in
Mathematics. In 1911, he ranked third in the ISc
exam while the first position went to another
great scientist Satyendranath Bose. After that he
took admission in Presidency College, Calcutta
(now Kolkata). In 1913, he graduated from
Presidency College with Mathematics major and
got the second rank in the first one. In 1915, both
S. N. Bose and Meghnad Saha ranked first in
M.Sc. exam, Meghnad Saha in Applied
Mathematics and S.N. Bose in Pure Mathematics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

In 1917, he started his professional career and
joined as lecturer at the newly opened University
College of Science in Calcutta. He taught
Quantum Physics. Along with S.N. Bose, he
translated the papers published in German by
Einstein and Hermann Minkowski on relativity
into English versions. In 1919, American
Astrophysical Journal published – “On Selective
Radiation Pressure and its Application” – a
research paper by Meghnad Saha. He put
forward an “ionization formula” which
explained the presence of the spectral lines. The
formula proved to be a breakthrough in
astrophysics. He went abroad and stayed for two
years. He spent time in research at Imperial
College, London and at a research laboratory in
Germany.
<br>
<br>
In 1932, Meghnad Saha moved to Allahabad
University and Uttar Pradesh Academy of
Science was established in 1932. He returned to
Science College, Calcutta in 1938. During this
time, Saha got interested in Nuclear physics. In
1947, he established Institute of Nuclear Physics
which later was named after him as Saha
Institute of Nuclear Physics.
Having seen cyclotrons used for research in
nuclear physics abroad, he ordered one to be
installed in the institute. In 1950, India had its
first cyclotron in operation. He invented an
instrument to measure the weight and pressure
of solar rays. He produced the famous equation,
which he called ‘equation of the reaction-isobar
for ionization’, which later became known as
Saha’s “Thermo-Ionization Equation”.
Saha was the leading spirit in organizing the
scientific societies like the ‘National Academy of
Science’ (1930), ‘Indian Institute of Science’
(1935), and the ‘Indian Association for the
Cultivation of Science’ (1944). The lasting
memorial to him is the ‘Saha Institute of Nuclear
physics’ founded in 1943 in Calcutta.
He was the chief architect of river planning
in India. He prepared the original plan for
Damodar Valley Project. For the sake of
development of science he joined politics and in
1952 he was elected as a Member of Parliament
for the North-West Calcutta constituency. He
was an advocate for the peaceful use of nuclear
energy and instrumental in the reformation of
the Indian calendar. He died on February 16,
1956 due to a heart attack.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Meghnad Saha was an Indian astrophysicist
who nominated for the ‘Nobel prize’ in physics
in 1935-36. In 1927, Meghnad was elected as a
fellow of London's Royal Society.
In 1947, he established Institute of Nuclear
Physics which later was named after him as Saha
Institute of Nuclear Physics. He took the first
effort to include Nuclear Physics in the
curriculum of higher studies of science.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>RAJA RAMANNA</i></strong></div>

Raja Ramanna was a multifaceted
personality – an eminent nuclear physicist, a
highly accomplished technologist, an able
administrator, an inspiring leader, a gifted
musician, a scholar of Sanskrit literature and
philosophy. He made important contributions,
both theoretical and experimental, in various
areas of nuclear physics.
<br>
<br>
Following the ideals of his illustrious
predecessors Homi Bhabha and Vikram
Sarabhai in India’s nuclear energy programme,
Ramanna played an important role in placing
the country’s indigenous nuclear capabilities on
a firm footing and in this process his
contributions towards shaping India’s energy
and security programmes are quite significant.
In fact Ramanna is regarded as one of the most
successful creators of Science and Technology
in India.
<br>
<br>
Ramanna’s contribution to India’s peaceful
nuclear explosion experiment is well-known.
India’s first peaceful nuclear experiment was
carried out underground in the Rajasthan desert,
Pokhran, on May 18, 1974.
Ramanna was born in Tumkur in Karnataka
on January 28, 1925. His father, B. Ramanna,
was in the judicial service of the Mysore state.
He had his early education in Mysore and
Bangalore. After completing his intermediate
studies at St Joseph’s, Bangalore he joined the
Madras Christian College in Tambaram. After
obtaining his BSc (Honours) degree in physics
from Madras Christian College in Tambaram,
he went to England to work for his doctoral in
the field of nuclear physics at the King’s College,
London, as Tata Scholar. He obtained his PhD
degree in 1948. Ramanna was deeply influenced
by Homi Jehangir Bhabha. Ramanna died on
24th September, 2004 at Mumbai after a cardiac
arrest.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

Ramanna made important contributions in
several areas of neutron, nuclear and reactor
physics. Ramanna played a leading role in
organizing physics and rector physics
programmes at the Bhabha Atomic Research
Centre, Trombay. Ramanna was a young reactor
physicist in the team under Bhabha, when
India’s first research reactor, Apsara, was
commissioned on August 04, 1956.
As a part of the studies relating to the design
and construction of Apsara, Ramanna studied
the process of neutron thermalisation in several
moderating assemblies. Ramanna and his group
determined the neutron diffusion and slowing
down constants in water and beryllium oxide
by using a pulsed neutron source. The neutron
spectra emerging out of these moderating
assemblies were also studied.
<br>
<br>
Apsara, once commissioned, made intense
thermal neutron beams available for basic
research. This prompted Ramanna to undertake
a programme of experimental investigations of
secondary radiations emitted in thermal neutroninduced fission of U235.
Ramanna and his coworkers measured the
energy and angular distributions of prompt
neutrons and gamma rays emitted by fission
fragments. Such measurements provided
important information on the times of these
radiations, presence of scission neutrons, the
average spin of the fission fragments and so on.
The investigations carried out by Ramanna and
his coworkers on light charged particle emission
in fission induced by thermal and fast neutrons
provided important insight on the mechanism
of emission of these particles.
<br>
<br>
The stochastic theory of fragment mass and
charge distributions in fission is a unique
contribution of Ramanna to fission theory. The
theory, which was based on the model of a
random exchange of nucleons between the two
nascent fission fragments prior to scission, could
explain most of the observed features of
fragment mass and charge distribution in low
energy fission and their dependence on the
excitation energy of the fissioning nucleus. A
geometrical interpretation of atomic and nuclear
binding energies was another novel contribution
of Ramanna and his group.
<br>
<br>
Ramanna’s most important contribution was
the creation of a vast pool of trained scientific
manpower. To develop the skilled manpower
required for this task, the BARC (DAE) Training
School was established in 1957 under the
leadership of Ramanna.
Ramanna directly or indirectly helped to
build up a number of institutions in the country.
In the early 1980s he took the initiative for setting
up a Centre for Advanced Technology at Indore,
devoted to the development for advanced
accelerators, lasers and other related
technologies. He helped to establish the Variable
Energy Cyclotron Centre (VEC) at Kolkata.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Raja Ramanna was an able administrator.
He held many prestigious positions. He was the
Director of the Bhaba Atomic Research Centre
(1972-78 and 1981-83). He was Scientific
Advisor to the Minister of Defence; DirectorGeneral, DRDO and Secretary for Defence
Research, Government of India (1978-81). He
was Chairman of the Atomic Energy
Commission (1984-87). He was first Director of
the National Institute of Advanced Studies,
Bangalore established by J. R. D. Tata and
President, 30th General Conference of the
International Atomic Energy Agency (1986).
Ramanna served as the Minister of State for
Defence in the Union Cabinet (January to
November 1990). Ramanna was a nominated
Member of the Parliament, Rajya Sabha, (August
1997-August 2003). He was a member of the first
National Security Advisory Board. In whichever
capacity he worked, he worked with a
missionary zeal.
<br>
<br>
Among the various awards that he received
included: Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Award
(1963), Padma Vibhushan Award (1975),
Meghnad Saha Medal of the Indian National
Science Academy (1984), R. D. Memorial Award
(1985-86), Asutosh Mookerjee Gold Medal
(1996). He was awarded doctorate (honoris
causa) by several universities.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DR. SALIM ALI</i></strong></div>

Salim Moizuddin Abdul Ali was one of the
greatest ornithologists and naturalists of all time
and is also known as the “Birdman of India”.
He was one of the very first scientists to carry
out systematic bird surveys in India and abroad.
His research work is considered highly influential
in the development of ornithology. Dr. Sálim Ali
is also known as the father of Indian ornithology.
Salim Ali was born on November 12, 1896
in Bombay (now Mumbai). He attended college,
but did not receive any university degree. To
assist his brother in wolfram mining, he went to
Burma (now called Myanmar), but spent most
of his time looking for birds. Soon, he returned
back to Bombay.
<br>
<br>
This genius died on June 20, 1987 at the age
of 90.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

For twenty years he camped and studied
birds. With a notebook in his pocket and
binoculars, he walked hundreds of miles. It was
hard, scary, dangerous work.
As soon as Salim returned, he studied
zoology, and secured a position of a guide at the
museum of the Bombay Natural History Society.
Only 20 years old, he conducted the visitors and
instructed them about the preserved birds. His
interest in the living conditions of birds grew
even more. Therefore, Salim visited Germany
and saw Dr. Irvin Strassman. He came back to
India after one year but his post in the museum
had been removed for financial reasons.
Salim Ali, as a married man, required money
to make a living, so he joined the museum as a
clerk. He published a research paper discussing
the nature and activities of the weaver bird in
1930. The piece made him famous and
established his name in the field of ornithology.
Salim also traveled from place to place to find
out more about different species of the birds.
From what he had collected, he published
“The Book of Indian Birds in 1941? in which he
discussed the kinds and habits of Indian birds.
The book sold very well for a number of years.
He also collaborated with S. Dillon Ripley, a
world-famous ornithologist, in 1948. The
collaboration resulted in the ‘Handbook of the
Birds of India and Pakistan’ (10 Volume Set); a
comprehensive book that describes the birds of
the subcontinent, their appearance, habitat,
breeding habits, migration etc. Salim also
published other books. His work “The Fall of
Sparrow” included many incidents from his real
life.
<br>
<br>
Salim not only researched about birds, but
also contributed to the arena of protection of
nature. For his extraordinary efforts, he was
given an international award of Rs. 5 lacs, but
he donated all the money to Bombay Natural
History Society. The Government of India
honored him with Padma Vibushan in 1983.
National Wildlife Fellowship Award
In order to commemorate the memory of the
great wildlife conservationist of the country, i.e.,
Dr. Salim Ali to inspire and promote, particularly
the younger generation of wildlife managers and
scientists for taking up research/experimental
projects aimed at conservation of the rich wildlife
heritage of this country, the Govt. of India,
Ministry of Environment and Forests has decided
to award the fellowship alternatively each year.
Dr. Salim Ali National Wildlife Fellowship
Award, 2011 for, Research/experimental project

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DR. SHANTI SWAROOP BHATNAGAR</i></strong></div>

Dr. Shanti Swaroop Bhatnagar was a
eminent Scientist of India. He was known
as “The Father of Research Laboratories”.
Bhatnagar was born on February 21, 1894 in
Shahpur, now in Pakistan. After completing his
M. Sc. in India, he went to England on a
fellowship. He got his D. Sc. degree from the
London University in the year 1921, under the
guidance of chemistry professor Frederick G.
Donna. When he came back, Bhatnagar was
presented with proposal of professorship at the
renowned Banaras Hindu University.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements:</i></strong></div>

Though his area of interest included
emulsions, colloids, and industrial chemistry, but
his primary contributions were in the spheres of
magneto- chemistry. Prime Minister Jawaharlal
Nehru himself was an activist of scientific
development. After India gained freedom from
British rule in 1947, the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research was established under the
leadership of Dr. Bhatnagar, who was appointed
its first director-general. He became the first
director-general of the Council of Scientific and
Industrial Research (CSIR) in 1940.
He was known as the “The Father of
Research Laboratories”. He is largely
remembered for having established various
chemical laboratories in India. He also developed
a total twelve national laboratories, just a few
names are Central Food Processing
Technological Institute, Mysore, the National
Physical Laboratories, New Delhi, National
Chemical Laboratory, Pune, the Central Fuel
Institute, Dhanbad, and the National
Metallurgical Laboratory, Jamshedpur.
<br>
<br>
He also played an important part with Homi
Jehangir Bhabha, P .C. Mahalanobis, Vikram
Sarabhai and others in building of postindependent S &T infrastructure and in the
formulation of India’s science and technology
policies. He was the founder Director of the
Council of Scientific and Industrial Research
(CSIR) which later it became a major agency for
research in India. He was also the Chairman of
the University Grants Commission (UGC).
Bhatnagar was the Secretary of Ministry of
Education and Educational Adviser to the
Government. He played a major role both in
the Constitution and Deliberations of the
Scientific Manpower Committee Report of 1948.
He was a University Professor for more than 19
years. He first worked at the Banaras Hindu
University, then he moved to Punjab University,
where he had a reputation as a very inspiring
teacher.
<br>
<br>
His contribution in the areas of magnetochemistry and physical chemistry of emulsion
were largely recognized. He played an
instrumental role in the establishment of the
National Research Development Corporation
(NRDC) of India, which brinsg coordination
between research and development. He was
responsible for the initiation of the Industrial
Research Association movement in India.
Bhatnagar constituted the one-man
Commission in 1951 to negotiate with oil
companies for starting refineries and this
ultimately led to the establishment of many oil
refineries in different parts of the country. He
induced many individuals and organizations to
donate liberally for the cause of science and
education. He exhibited high poetic talent
particularly in Urdu. He died in 1st January 1955
at the age of 60 in New Delhi.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Bhatnagar used to spend all his spare time
in his laboratory doing research. Dr. Bhatnagar
was knighted by the British Government in the
year 1941 as an award for his research in science,
whereas, on March 18, 1943 he was selected as
fellow of the Royal Society. Bhatnagar was also
a recipient of “Padma Vibhushan” in 1954. After
his death, ASIR established a Bhatnagar

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>BIRBAL SAHNI</i></strong></div>

Birbal Sahni (1891- 1949) was a world
famous palaeobotanist, who studied the fossils
of the Indian subcontinent. He was born on 14th
November 1891 at Bhera, Saharanpur District,
now a part of West Punjab in Pakistan. He was
the founder of Birbal Sahni Institute of
Palaeobotany, which is situated in Lucknow.
He was the son of Ishwar Devi and Lala
Ruchi Ram Sahani. His father was a chemistry
teacher who was interested in the study of
nature. He got his education from Punjab
University, Lahore. Later on, in 1911 he went to
England, where he entered the Emmanuel
College at Cambridge. In 1913 Sahni obtained a
first class in Part-I of the Natural Sciences Tripos
and he completed the Part-II of the Tripos in
1915. After that he studied under Professor A.C.
Seward, and got his D.Sc. Degree from Landon
University in 1919.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Contributions and Achievements</i></strong></div>

After completion of his education Birbal
Sahni came back to India and worked as
Professor of Botany at Banaras Hindu
University, Varanasi and Punjab University for
about a year.
Palaeobotany is a subject which requires the
knowledge of botany and geology subject. It also
require for an daring guts and a physique good
enough for trekking on the mountains for
collection of rocks that contain plant fossils. Once
the rocks have been collected and ground, the
abilities of a detective are required to piece
together the picture of that ancient plant from
the scattered information available in the fossils.
From childhood Sahni was interested in these
qualities.
<br>
<br>
Birbal Sahni was the first botanist to study
extensively the flora of Indian Gondwana. Sahni
also explored the Rajmahal hills in Jharkhand,
which is a treasury of fossils of ancient plants.
Here he discovered some new genus of plants.
His research contribution in palaeobotany
covered such a vast range that no aspect of
palaeobotany in India was left untouched by
him. Amongst a large number of fossil plants
described by him from Rajmahal Hills of
Jharkhand, was his most remarkable discovery
of a new group of fossil gymnosperms, to which
he gave the name “Pentoxylae”. Sahni studied
Ptilophyllum and other related elements from
Rajmahal Hills and found that stem Buaklandia,
leaf Ptilophyllum and flower Williamsonia
belong to the same plant which he reconstructed
and named as Williamsonia sewardiana.
Birbal Sahni was not only botanist but also
geologist. By using simple instruments and his
huge knowledge of ancient plants, he estimated
the age of some old rocks. He showed to the
people that the age of the salt range, now in
Pakistan Punjab, is 40 to 60 million years old and
not about 100 million years, as believed till then.
He found that the Deccan Traps in Madhya
Pradesh were of the tertiary period, about 62
million years old. Besides, Sahni took a keen
interest in archaeology. One of his investigations
led to the discovery of coin moulds in Rohtak in
1936. For his studies on the technique of casting
coins in ancient India he was awarded the
Nelson Wright Medal of the Numismatic Society
of India in 1945.
<br>
<br>
Palaeobotanical studies should be done in
relation to the geological and geographical
conditions under which the plants lived and
died. He himself made important contributions
in geological studies. He threw considerable light
on problems like the age of the Deccan Traps,
the Saline Series and the timing of the Himalayan
uplift.
Being a teacher, Sahni first raised the
standard of teaching at the Department of
Botany. Next he established the Department of
Geology. A logical sequence was the
establishment of the institute of palaeobotany.
It was the first of its kind in the world.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Recognition and Honours</i></strong></div>

Because of abiding interest in geology and
his fundamental contributions to the study of
plant life in the past, Birbal Sahni was recognized
by several academies and institutions in India
and abroad. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal
Society of London (FRS) in 1936, the highest
British scientific honor, awarded for the first time
to an Indian botanist. He was elected VicePresident, Palaeobotany section, of the
International Botanical Congresses of 1930 and
1935, respectively; General President of the
Indian Science Congress for 1940; President,
National Academy of Sciences, India, 1937–1939
and 1943-1944. In 1948 he was elected an
Honorary Member of the American Academy
of Arts and Sciences. Another high honour
which came to him was his election as an
Honorary President of the International Botanical
Congress, Stockholm in 1950.
<br>
<br>
Sahni died on 10th April, 1949 within less
than a week of the foundation stone laying
ceremony of his institute. His wife, Savitri Sahni,
completed the task he had left undone. The
institute is today known as the Birbal Sahni
Institute of Palaeobotany. In November 1969 the
Palaeobotanical Society divested its possession
of the Institute and transferred its assets to Birbal
Institute of Plaeobotany Society whereby the
Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaebotany came
under the management of its new Governing
Body under the Department of Science and
Technology, Government of India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DR. A.P.J. ABDUL KALAM</i></strong></div>

Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
popularly known as Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam,
served the country as the 11th President of India.
It is very significant that he is the first scientist
to occupy the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He is a man
who has taken unto himself, the task of changing
the destiny of India. He is a man with a vision.
Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam is often also referred to
as the ‘Missile Man of India’.
His vision is to make India a developed
country. He has given his plan of action and a
road map for realizing his vision. He has
articulated his thoughts in his three books: India
2020: A Vision for the New Millennium, Wings
of Fire: An Autobiography of A. P. J. Abdul
Kalam and Ignited Minds: Unleashing the Power
Within India.
<br>
<br>
Dr. Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, in
a middle-class Tamil family in the island town
of Rameswaram, Dhanushkodi, in Tamil Nadu.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Achievements & Contribution</i></strong></div>

After studying in a primary school in
Ramaeswaran, Dr. Kalam went to Schwartz
High School at Ramanathpuram from where he
went to Tiruchchirapalli for his higher studies.
After completing his BSc from St. Joseph’s college
he joined the Madras Institute of Technology
(MIT), for studying aeronautical engineering.
From MIT, he went to Hindustan Aeronautics
Limited (HAL) at Bangalore as a trainee. As
aeronautical engineer Dr. Kalam had two
options -- in short, to join the Directorate of
Technical Development and Production, or DTD
& P (Air) of the Ministry of Defence or the Indian
Air Force. As he could not make it to Indian Air
Force, Dr. Kalam joined the Technical Centre
(Civil Aviation) of the DTD&P (Air) as Senior
Scientific Assistant on a basic salary of Rs. 250/.
While working at the Air force Directorate
he got a chance to realise his dream. He joined
the Indian Committee for Space Research
(INCOSPAR), the predecessor of the Indian
Space Research Organisation (ISRO). And thus
Dr. Kalam started his much talked about career
in rocket and missile technology.
First Phase: Before he became President of
the country, Dr. Kalam had divided his career
in four phases. In the first phase (1963-82) he
worked with the Indian Space Research
Organisation (ISRO). At ISRO he served in
various capacities. After initiating Fibre
Reinforced Plastics (FRP) activities and spending
some time with the aerodynamics and design
group he joined the satellite launching vehicle
team at Thumba. Here he was made the Project
Director of the Mission for SLV-3. He played a
crucial role in developing satellite launch vehicle
technology and expertise in control, propulsion
and aerodynamics. The SLV-3 project managed
to put Rohini, a scientific satellite, into orbit in
July 1980. India also acquired the ability to
design various kinds of rocket systems.
<br>
<br>
Second Phase: The second phase of his
career started when he joined the Defence
Research and Development Organisation
(DRDO) in 1982. As Director of DRDO, Dr.
Kalam was entrusted with the Integrated Guided
Missile Development Programme (IGMDP).
Under his leadership India has been able to
develop strategic missiles. Like Nag (an anti-tank
guided missile), Prithvi (a surface to surface
battlefield missile), Akash (a swift, medium -
range surface-to-air missile), Trishul (a quickreaction surface-to-air missile) and Agni (an
intermediate range ballistic missile). Three new
laboratories/facilities in the area of missile
technology were established.
<br>
<br>
Third Phase: Dr. Kalam identifies his third
phase with his participation with India’s mission
to become a nuclear weapon state, jointly
undertaken by DRDO and Department of
Atomic Energy (DAE) with the active support
of the armed forces. During this phase he, as
Chairman of the Technology Information,
Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC),
also got involved with the creation of Technology
Vision 2020 and the India Millennium Missions
(IMM 2020), which is an integratied version of
technology vision and India’s security concerns.
In November 1999 Dr. Kalam was appointed as
Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government
of India.
<br>
<br>
Fourth Phase: His fourth phase started after
he left the post of Principal Scientific Adviser.
He joined the Anna University at Chennai as
Professor of Technology and Societal
Transformation. As part of realizing his mission
he decided to ignite the minds of the young. For
this purpose he wanted to reach at least 100,000
students in different parts of the country before
August 2003. He has already met about 40,000
students. His fourth phase took a sudden turn,
which he himself perhaps did not visualize: He
became the President of India.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Other field of Interest</i></strong></div>

Kalam continues to take an active interest in
other developments in the field of science and
technology as well. He has proposed a research
programmed for developing bio-implants. He is
a supporter of pen source software over
proprietary solutions and believes that the use
of open source software on a large scale will
bring more people the benefits of Information
Technology.
<br>
<br>
Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam regards his work on
India’s nuclear weapons program as a way to
assert India’s place as a future superpower. Even
during his tenure as president, APJ Kalam took
avid interest in all spheres of India’s science and
technology. He has even put forward a project
plan for establishing bio-implants. He is also an
ardent advocate of open source software over
proprietary solutions to churn out more profits
in the field of information technology in India.
Recognition and Honours
In 1997 Dr. APJ Kalam was given the highest
civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna.
Dr. Kalam became the President of India on July
25, 2002.

<br>
<br>
Dr. Lalji Singh and his colleagues developed
a probe called Bkm-derived probe for DNA
fingerprinting which brought CCMB to limelight.
Since then this probe is being extensively used
for forensic investigation, paternity
determination and seed stock verification.
For the first time in the annals of Indian
history DNA fingerprinting evidence was
presented in the court of law. This unique work
of Lalji, prompted Government of India's
Department of Biotechnology (DBT) to form
autonomous institution "Centre for DNA
Fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD)" in 1995.
Currently housed at CCMB, Lalji shouldered the
responsibility of setting up of this new national
facility. As its Officer-on-Special-Duty (OSD),
Lalji worked towards development, acquisition
and standardization of protocols for carrier
detection, prenatal diagnosis and genetic
counseling for all the genetic disorders prevalent
within India.
<br>
<br>
In order to explore the tremendous potential
of the indigenously developed technology of
DNA fingerprinting, Dr. Lalji Singh has
proposed, pursued and established a new centre,
the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting and
Diagnostics (CDFD) at Hyderabad under the
Department of Biotechnology (DBT). In July
1998 he was appointed as the Director of the
Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology
(CCMB), Hyderabad.
Based on the studies of Dr. Lalji Singh and
his colleagues on Wildlife Conservation,
Government of India has set up a "Laboratory
for the Conservation of Endangered Species
(LaCONES)" in Hyderabad. For regenerative
medicine, Dr Singh has setup 'Clinical Research
Facility (CRF)' in collaboration with NIMS. He
is founder of 'Genome Foundation', a non-profitmaking organization registered under
Companies Act 25 in Hyderabad.
The social impact of some of the research
works carried out by Dr. Singh include
development of a Universal Probe for DNA
fingerprinting, conservation of wildlife, species
identification for forensic applications, DNA
based molecular diagnostics and work on genetic
affinities of Andaman islanders.
