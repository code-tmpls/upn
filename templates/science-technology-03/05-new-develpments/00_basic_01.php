<h3>New Developments</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MRAM Technology</i></strong></div>

A team of researchers, led by Dr Yang
Hyunsoo, from the Department of Electrical &
Computer Engineering at the National
University of Singapore (NUS) Faculty of
Engineering developed the new Magnetoresistive
Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology
that that enables bigger and longer lasting
memory in electronics such as laptops and
smartphones. The technology will drastically
increase storage space and enhance memory
which will ensure that fresh data stays intact,
even in the case of a power failure.
The new technology can also be applied in
transportation, military and avionics systems,
robotics, etc. Currently pursued schemes with
a very thin magnetic layer can only retain
information for about a year. The innovation is
expected to change the architecture of
computers, making them much easier to
manufacture as it does away with many
facilities such as flash memory, effectively
bringing down the cost.
<br>
<br>
MRAM is emerging as the next big thing in
data storage as it is non-volatile, which means
that data can be retrieved even when the
electronic equipment is not powered up. The
current methods of applying MRAM revolve
round the technology which uses an 'in-plane',
or horizontal, current-induced magnetisation.
This method uses ultra-thin ferromagnetic
structures which are challenging to implement
due to their thickness of less than 1 nanometre.
Their manufacturing reliability is low and tends
to retain information for only less than a year.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indigenous Cervical Cancer Diagnostic Kit</i></strong></div>

The Union Health and Family Welfare
Ministry launched AV Magnivisualizer, an
indigenous device that can detect early cervical
cancer and be used even by healthcare workers
with basic training.
<br>
<br>
The device AV Magnivisualizer which was
developed by the Institute of Cytology and
Preventive Oncology under the Indian Council
of Medical Research (ICMR) has 95 per cent
accuracy for detecting pre-cancerous lesions.
Randomised clinical control trials have
confirmed its efficacy in reducing incidence and
mortality of the disease. It can be made available
in remote rural areas.
This is a user-friendly device which costs
about Rs 10,000 as against the present devices
which cost between Rs 8-10 lakh and are beyond
the reach of most people.
<br>
<br>
The device has a white light source with
variable interchangeable magnification and can
be operated on a 12- volt battery in rural and
semi-urban areas where electric supply is not
regular. Magnivisualizer has been found to pick
up 1.5 times more high-grade pre-cancerous
lesions than the ordinary tungsten light.
AV Magnivisualizer would be available in
the market within the next 8-9 months and
efforts would be made to provide them up to
the Community Health Centres in the initial
phase. In the next phase it would be made
available in the Primary Health Centres (PHC),
where cervical cancer cases go undetected.
Cervical cancer is the most common
malignancy among Indian women, particularly
those who marry early. Current estimates
indicate that approximately 1.32 lakh new cases
are diagnosed and 74,000 deaths occur annually
in India, accounting for nearly one-third of
global cervical cancer deaths.
Cervical cancer takes about a decade to fully
develop and is often detected when it has spread
substantially. It starts from a pre-cancer stage
called dysplasias and early detection and
appropriate treatment at this stage can halt its
progression, resulting in decreased incidence or
mortality.
<br>
<br>
At present, cytology screening or Pap Smear
is available only in advanced cytology centres,
Regional Cancer Centres and some medical
colleges. The required infrastructure, trained
manpower and related mechanism for initial
screening are not available to carry out
population-based screening at the State or the
national level.
<br>
<br>
Worldwide Facts About Cervical Cancer
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Cervical cancer is the No. 1 women's
cancer in sub-Saharan Africa and is the
third most common cancer in women
worldwide, with 530,000 new cases and
275,00 deaths annually.</li>
        <li>Some 80 to 90 percent of women in subSaharan Africa have never had a pelvic
exam.</li>
        <li>More than 85 percent of the global burden
of cervical cancer occurs in resourcelimited countries, yet the World Health
Organization estimates less than 5
percent of these women have access to
screening even once in a lifetime.</li>
        <li>Cervical cancer is four to five times more
prevalent among women who are HIV positive.</li>
        <li>HPV vaccination offers a promising
solution for women in developing nations
who do not have access to screenings for
cervical cancer, although the cost of the
vaccination is a major barrier for many
resource-limited countries.</li>
        <li>Cervical cancer is the No. 1 cancer
affecting women in 37 countries in South
and Central America, west and southern
Africa, and Asia.</li>
        <li>Cervical cancer occurs in the cells of the
cervix, the lower part of the uterus that
connects to a woman's vagina. Various
strains of the human papillomavirus
(HPV), a sexually transmitted infection,
are the culprits in causing most cases of
cervical cancer.</li>
        <li>Most women's immune systems prevent
the HPV virus from turning cancerous. In
a small percentage of women, however,
the virus survives for years, and, if not
detected and prevented, some cells on the
surface of the cervix turn into cancer cells.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Greenest Supercomputer</i></strong></div>

 One of the world's greenest supercomputer
has been created by Cambridge University. The
energy-efficient high-performance computer,
named Wilkes after Cambridge computing
pioneer Maurice Wilkes, has been listed second
in the 'Green 500'; placed 166 in the Top 500 list
of the world's fastest supercomputers. It is the
most efficient air-cooled supercomputer in the
world and fastest GPU supercomputer in the
UK.
<br>
<br>
The performance of Wilkes is equivalent to
4,000 desktop computers working at the same
time; it has energy efficiency of 3,361 Mega-flops
per watt; provides 100 gigabytes per-second
bandwidth, and a message rate of over 137
million messages a second.
The supercomputer, designed and built by
the in-house engineering team, will be used for
the development of the Square Kilometre Array
(SKA), the world's largest telescope.
Apart from playing a crucial role in the design
process of SKA, the supercomputer can also be
used to design and test jet engines and new drugs
to fight cancer, and study the fundamental
nature of the nucleus of the atom.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAVEN launched by NASA</i></strong></div>

NASA has launched its unmanned MAVEN
spacecraft towards Mars to study the Red
Planet's atmosphere for clues as to why Earth's
neighbour lost its warmth and water over time.
The white Atlas V 401 rocket carrying the Mars
Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN)
orbiter blasted off on schedule time. MAVEN is
the first spacecraft devoted to exploring and
understanding the Martian upper atmosphere.
The flawless lift-off of the $671 million
spacecraft kicked off the 10-month journey to
the Red Planet. Arrival at Mars is scheduled for
September 2014, with the science mission of the
solar-wing panelled orbiter set to begin two
months later.
<br>
<br>
One of its three scientific tools is a solar wind
and ionosphere gauge called the Particles and
Fields Package, built by the University of
California at Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory.
A second tool, called the Remote Sensing
Package, was built by the Laboratory for
Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University
of Colorado and will determine global
characteristics of the upper atmosphere and
ionosphere. The third instrument, the Neutral
Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer, was built by
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. It will
measure the composition and isotopes of neutrals
and ions.
<br>
<br>
The probe is different from past NASA
missions because it focuses not on the dry surface
but on the mysteries of the never-before-studied
upper atmosphere. Much of MAVEN's year-long
mission will be spent circling the planet 6,000
kilometers above the surface. However, it will
execute five deep dips to a distance of just 125
kilometers above the Martian landscape to get
readings of the atmosphere at various levels.
Researchers have described the mission as a
search for a missing piece to the puzzle of what
happened to Mars' atmosphere, perhaps billions
of years ago, to transform Earth's neighbour from
a water-bearing planet that might have been
favourable for life to a dry, barren desert.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mars Orbiter Mission</i></strong></div>

<b>Cyber Coalition 2013:</b> NATO's Largestever Cyber-security Exercise
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) has started its largest-ever cyber security
exercises to practice thwarting large and
simultaneous attacks on member states and their
partners. The drill was hosted by National
Defence College training centre in Tartu, Estonia.
Codenamed Cyber Coalition 2013, the
exercises involve participants from more than 30
countries across Europe, including five nonNATO nations: Austria, Finland, Ireland,
Sweden, and Switzerland. New Zealand and the
European Union have the observer status.
The exercises are aimed at training technical
personnel and their leadership as well as testing
the capability of NATO and its partners to
coordinate their efforts in foiling multiple

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>World's First Nanotube Computer
Unveiled</i></strong></div>

A group of Stanford researchers led by
Professor Subhasish Mitra had successfully built
a working computer albeit an extremely simple
one entirely from transistors fashioned from
carbon nanotubes. The nanotubes have long
held the promise of allowing smaller, faster and
lower-powered computing, though they have
proved difficult to work with.
<br>
<br>
The computer can right now perform only
basic functions at speeds likened to a 1950s
computer, but the tiny machine was hailed as a
breakthrough in the search for an alternative to
silicon transistors. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are
rolled-up, single-layer sheets of carbon atoms
tens of thousands can fit into the width of a
single human hair. They are pliable and have
the highest strength-to-weight ratio of any
known material. Silicon is a good semiconductor
but cannot be reduced to such a thin layer.
Experts believe the structure of CNTs may make
them better at carrying currents thus yielding
transistors that are faster, more energy efficient
and smaller than silicon.
The computer is just a few square millimetres
in size and able to perform basic counting and
number-sorting functions using 178 transistors
each holding between 10 and 200 nanotubes. It
runs at 1 kilohertz—a processing capacity
millions of times weaker than today's computers.
The 178-transistor limit was due to the team
using a university chip-making facility rather
than an industrial process, meaning the
computer could in theory be made much bigger
and faster. The machine ran a basic operating
system that allowed it to multitask and swap
between the two processes.
<br>
<br>
Mitra and his team had been able to deal
with two inherent shortcomings of CNT
transistors: the tubes do not always grow in
perfectly straight lines, which mean that
mispositioned ones can cause a short circuit,
while others changed form and could not be
switched on and off. The team devised a method
to burn up and eliminate the uncontrolled CNTs
in a transistor and to bypass mispositioned ones.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MERS VIRUS</i></strong></div>

MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus), previously known as
the Novel Coronavirus or SARS-like virus, is a
member of the coronavirus family.
Coronaviruses commonly cause respiratory
illness in mammals, including humans.
Coronaviruses are responsible for approximately
1 in every 3 cases of the common cold. MERSCoV is much more deadly than any other
coronavirus seen before.
MERS-CoV is a new coronavirus strain that
appeared last year. It started making people ill
in the Middle East in 2012 and was first identified
when a man in Saudi Arabia came down with
"SARS-like" symptoms. He died in June 2012.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Symptoms</i></strong></div>

Coronaviruses cause respiratory infections in
humans and animals. Patients have been
presented with fever, cough and breathing
difficulties.
It causes pneumonia and, sometimes, kidney
failure. Most of the people who have been
infected so far have been older men, often with
other medical conditions.
What are the treatment options for MERSCoV infection?
According to the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and WHO
(World Health Organization), there are no
specific treatments for patients who become ill
with MERS-CoV infection.
<br>
<br>
All what doctors can currently do is provide
supportive medical care to help relieve the
symptoms. Supportive cares means providing
treatment to prevent, control or relieve
complications and side effects, as well as
attempting to improve the patient's comfort and
quality of life. Supportive care (supportive
therapy) does not include treating or improving
the illness/condition.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fixed Dose Drug Combinations</i></strong></div>

A combination drug most commonly refers
to a fixed-dose combination (FDC), which is a
formulation including two or more active
pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) combined in
a single dosage form, which is manufactured and
distributed in certain respective fixed doses.
Advantages-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Simpler dosage schedule improves
compliance and therefore improves
treatment outcomes.</li>
        <li>Reduces inadvertent medication errors.</li>
        <li>Allows for syngergistic combinations.</li>
        <li>Eliminates drug shortages by simplifying
drug storage and handling, and thus
lowers risk of being "out of stock".</li>
        <li>Procurement, management and handling
of drugs is simplified.</li>
        <li>Side effects are reduced by using one drug
of the combination for this purpose.</li>
        <li>Potential for drug abuse can be minimized
by using one drug of the combination for
this purpose.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
Disadvantages-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>FDCs are (possibly) more expensive than
separate tablets.</li>
        <li>Potential quality problems, especially with
rifampicin in FDCs for TB, requiring bioavailability testing.</li>
        <li>Dosing is inflexible and cannot be
regulated to patient's needs (each patient
has unique characteristics such as weight,
age, pharmacogenetics, co-morbidity, that
may alter drug metabolism and effect).</li>
        <li>Drug interactions may lead to alteration
of the therapeutic effect.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Umpire Decision Review System</i></strong></div>

The Umpire Decision Review System is a
technology-based system used in the sport of
cricket. The system was first introduced in Test
cricket, for the sole purpose of reviewing
controversial decisions made by the on-field
umpires in the case of a batsman being dismissed
or not.
There are basically three components in
UDRS.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Hawk-Eye, Eagle Eye, or Virtual Eye: balltracking technology that plots the
trajectory of a bowling delivery that has
been interrupted by the batsman, often
by the pad, and can determine whether it
would have hit the wicket or not.</li>
        <li>Hot Spot: Infra-red imaging system that
illuminates where the ball has been in
contact with bat or pad.</li>
        <li>Snickometer, which relies on directional
microphones to detect small sounds made
as the ball hits the bat or pad, however is
no longer used.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Digital Signature</i></strong></div>

A digital signature is a mathematical scheme
for demonstrating the authenticity of a digital
message or document. A valid digital signature
gives a recipient reason to believe that the
message was created by a known sender, such
that the sender cannot deny having sent the
message (authentication and non-repudiation)
and that the message was not altered in transit
(integrity). Digital signatures are commonly used
for software distribution, financial transactions,
and in other cases where it is important to detect
forgery or tampering.
<br>
<br>
Digital signatures can be used to authenticate
the source of messages. When ownership of a
digital signature secret key is bound to a specific
user, a valid signature shows that the message
was sent by that user.
A Digital Signature Certificate explicitly
associates the identity of an individual/device
with a pair of electronic keys - public and private
keys - and this association is endorsed by the CA.
The certificate contains information about a
user's identity (for example, their name, pincode,
country, email address, the date the certificate
was issued and the name of the Certifying
Authority that issued it).
<br>
<br>
These keys complement each other in that
one does not function in the absence of the other.
They are used by browsers and servers to encrypt
and decrypt information regarding the identity
of the certificate user during information
exchange processes. The private key is stored on
the user's computer hard disk or on an external
device such as a token. The user retains control
of the private key; it can only be used with the
issued password.
The public key is disseminated with the
encrypted information. The authentication
process fails if either one of these keys in not
available or do not match. This means that the
encrypted data cannot be decrypted and
therefore, is inaccessible to unauthorized parties.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>3D Printing Technology</i></strong></div>

Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a
process of making a three-dimensional solid
object of virtually any shape from a digital model.
3D printing is achieved using an additive
process, where successive layers of material are
laid down in different shapes. 3D printing is also
considered distinct from traditional machining
techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of
material by methods such as cutting or drilling.
Advantages-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Manufacture of Customized Products.</li>
        <li>Rapid Prototyping.</li>
        <li>Low cost of production.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
Disadvantages-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Manufacture of Dangerous Items</li>
        <li>Issues of counterfeiting.</li>
        <li>Issues of intellectual property rights.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>3D printing applications</i></strong></div>

One of the most important applications of
3D printing is in the medical industry. With 3D
printing, surgeons can produce mockups of parts
of their patient's body which needs to be operated
upon.
<br>
<br>
3D printing makes it possible to make a part
from scratch in just hours. It allows designers
and developers to go from flat screen to exact
part.
Nowadays almost everything from aerospace
components to toys are getting built with the help
of 3D printers. 3D printing is also used for
jewellery, architecture, fashion designing, art,
and interior designs.
What is the difference between a basic rapid
prototyping machine and a 3D printer?
3D printers are the simple version of rapid
prototyping machines.
<br>
<br>
Rapid prototyping is a conventional method
that has been used by automotive and aircraft
industries for years.
In general 3D printers are compact and
smaller than RP machines. They are ideal for use
in offices. They use less energy and take less
space. They are designed for low volume
reproduction of real objects made of nylon or
other plastics. That also means 3D printers make
smaller parts. Rapid prototyping machines have
build chambers at least 10 inches on a side, a 3D
printer has less than 8 inches on a side. However,
a 3D printer is capable of all the functions of
rapid prototyping machine such as verifying and
validating design, creating prototype, remote
sharing of information, etc.
Consequently 3D printers are easy to handle
and cheap to maintain. You can buy one of those
DIY kit in the market and build up yourself. It is
cheaper than the professional rapid prototyping,
for $1000 or less you can have one 3D printer,
while the professional rapid prototyping cost at
least $50,000.
<br>
<br>
3D printers are less accurate than rapid
prototyping machines. Because of its simplicity
the material choices are also limited.
14. FRP Composite Material
Fibre-reinforced plastic (FRP) (also fibrereinforced polymer) is a composite material made
of a polymer matrix reinforced with fibres. The
fibres are usually glass, carbon, basalt or aramid,
although other fibres such as paper or wood or
asbestos have been sometimes used. FRP has the
following properties-
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Light weight</li>
        <li>High strength-to-weight ratio</li>
        <li>Corrosion resistance</li>
        <li>Weather resistance</li>
        <li>Low thermal conductivity</li>
        <li>Non-magnetic</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Applications of FRP Composites in
Construction</i></strong></div>

Fibre-reinforced plastics are best suited for
any design programme that demands weight
savings, precision engineering, finite tolerances,
and the simplification of parts in both production
and operation. A moulded polymer artefact is
cheaper, faster, and easier to manufacture than
cast aluminium or steel artefact, and maintains
similar and sometimes better tolerances and
material strengths.
<br>
<br>
There are three broad divisions into which
applications of FRP in civil engineering can be
classified: applications for new construction,
repair and rehabilitation applications, and
architectural applications.
FRPs have been used widely by civil
engineers in the design of new construction.
Structures such as bridges and columns built
completely out of FRP composites have
demonstrated exceptional durability, and
effective resistance to effects of environmental
exposure. Pre-stressing tendons, reinforcing bars,
grid reinforcement and dowels are all examples
of the many diverse applications of FRP in new
structures.
<br>
<br>
One of the most common uses for FRP
involves the repair and rehabilitation of damaged
or deteriorating structures. Several companies
across the world are beginning to wrap damaged
bridge piers to prevent collapse and steelreinforced columns to improve the structural
integrity and to prevent buckling of the
reinforcement.
Architects have also discovered the many
applications for which FRP can be used. These
include structures such as siding/cladding,
roofing, flooring and partitions.
