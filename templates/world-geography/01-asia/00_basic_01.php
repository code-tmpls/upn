<h3>Asia</h3>



<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Introduction</i></strong></div>

Asia is the largest of all the continents and
includes an area of 44,444,100 sq km which is
about 33 per cent of the world's total land
surface and the greater part of the Eurasian
landmass. The total population of Asia in 2001
was 3,720 million, which is likely to be 4,714
million in 2025 and 5,262 million in 2050. About
37 percent of the total population of Asia is
urban. The Asian countries are usually grouped
into five main geographical and politico-cultural sub-divisions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Southwest Asia, which includes Afghanistan, Bahrain, Cyprus, Iran, Iraq, Israel,
Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi
Arabia, Yemen plus Turkey (on both sides of
the Sea of Marmara in Asia and Europe), and
Egypt, east of Suez Canal (Sinai peninsula).</li>
        <li>South Asia, which includes Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon).</li>
        <li>Southeast Asia, which includes Brunei,
Myanmar (formerly Burma), Cambodia,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</li>
        <li>East Asia, which includes China, Japan,
North Korea, South Korea and Taiwan.</li>
        <li>Central Asia, which includes all of Siberia
and the Russian republics in Asia
(Kazakhstan, Kirghizia, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

Some of the highest, lowest and coldest
places on Earth are found in Asia. Mount
Everest in the Himalayas is the highest, the
Dead Sea in the west is the lowest and the
frozen wastes of northern Siberia are among
the coldest. The Northern Asia is made up of
old mountains and ancient stable plateaus. The
Jagged Himalayan mountains dominate the
central part of the continent along with the
plateau of Tibet, which stretches north into
China. In south-east Asia, there are many islands. 
Volcanoes and earthquakes are common and some of the islands are volcanically formed.
The Arabian peninsula and mountainous
Iranian plateau are divided by the Gulf, fed by
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Further east,
the land begins to rise, the mountains spreading to north of the plateau of Tibet and South
of the Himalayas. The plain of the south of the
Himalayas are drained by the Indus and Ganges
and to the east of the plateau of Tibet the Yellow River.
In the far north of Asia, the land is permanently frozen which is known as "Permafrost".
Asia is watered by many great rivers. India's
Ganges has its source high in the Himalayas.
Tropical forests blanket the landscape across
much of Southeast Asia especially in Burma,
Thailand and islands of Borneo, Celebes, Java
and Sumatra. The "Takla Makan" is one of the
several deserts in Central Asia.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Feature</i></strong></div>

In Asia there is the existence of various
traditions, people and culture. The breakup of
Soviet Union, which once stretched south from
Russia to Iran produced the new Central Asian
Republic of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The countries
in southwest Asia are mainly Muslim, but are
divided by religious difference and conflict.
India is the world's largest democracy while
China is a communist power. China and North
Korea have been governed by strict communist
government since the late 1940s. In 1991,
people in the Soviet Union rejected communism and elected the 
first non-communist government after almost 70 years. During 
the Soviet Era, the Islamic faith and culture in Central Asia were actively suppressed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>

The deserts and high mountains of Asia
are almost uninhabited and much of the Russian Federation is very sparsely populated.
Singapore is one of the world's most densely
populated places. Japan and India also have
very high densities. Over 20 per cent of the
World's people live in China but India is fast
catching up.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

Agricultural occupation is still dominating
around the continent. Heavy industry dominated eastern China and Russia, but Japan is
the most industrially productive country. In
recent years booming 'tiger' economies have developed in countries such as Taiwan which
borders the Pacific Ocean. Norilsk is one of
several Soviet Era industrial complexes built in
Russia. It is the processing centre for rich minerals reserve found nearby.
Japan is a world-leading producer of electronic and high-tech goods like computer, cameras and hi-fi equipment. Taiwan, South Korea
and Singapore also produce electronic goods.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mineral Resources</i></strong></div>

Over half of the world's oil gas reserves are
in Asia, most importantly found in Gulf and in
Western Siberia. Coal in Siberia has provided
power for steel industries. Metallic minerals are
also abundant. Tin is found in southeast Asia
and Platinum and Nickel in Siberia. The discovery of oil in the Gulf has generated enormous wealth and produced rapid industrial and
social change in the countries such as Saudi
Arabia, U.A.E. and Kuwait which control the
oil supplies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate</i></strong></div>

The continental type of climate is prevalent in most part of the Asia, apart from the
coastal areas. Without the moderating effect of
the Ocean temperature can soar during the day
and plummet at night, while rainfall is generally low producing several large deserts. 
Temperature as low as -68°C have been recorded
in the frozen wastes of Siberia while the islands in Southeast Asia have tropical climates.
Southern and Eastern Asia are also affected by
a seasonal wind called the Monsoon. This originates in the Indian Ocean and brings heavy
rainfall and high winds.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Land-Use and Agriculture</i></strong></div>

The large expanses of Asia are uncultivated
because the soil is too poor or the climate is too
cold or dry for crops to grow. The plateau of
Tibet, much of Siberia and Arabian Peninsula
have limited agriculture. Some of the most fertile
land is found in eastern China and India, where
rice is a staple. Elsewhere cash-crops are grown
for profit, such as dates in southwest Asia, tea in
India, China and Sri Lanka and coconuts
throughout the island archipelago of Southeast
Asia. China is the world's largest producer of
rice, where it is grown in muddy fields called
paddy fields. Uzbekistan is the world's fourth largest producer of cotton.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>South West Asia</i></strong></div>

<b>Landscape</b>
<br>
<br>
It chiefly consists of the countries like
Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait,
Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria,
United Arab Emirates and Yemen. Much of
the Southwest Asia is covered with sandy and
rocky deserts. On the vast Arabian Peninsula
which covers an area almost the size of Indianarrow, sandy plains along the Red Sea and
the south-coast rise to dry mountains. In the
centre is a vast high plateau that slopes gently
down to the flat shores of the Gulf. 
The mountainous area of Iran experience frequent earthquakes.
The 'Wadis', a type of valley and riverbeds
are found in Saudi Arabian desert. Usually they
are dry, but after heavy rains, they are briefly
filled by fast flowing rivers. The Syrian desert
extends from the Jordon Valley in the west to
the fertile plains of the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers in the East. It is mainly a rocky desert, as
the sand has been swept away by winds and
occasional heavy rainstorms. Oases are areas
within a desert where water is available for
plants and human use. They are usually formed
when a fault, or split in the rock allows water
to come to surface. The Dead Sea is the large
lake on the border between Israel and Jordon.
<br>
<br>
It is the lowest point on the earth's surface. Its
shores lie 392 m below sea level. It is also the
world's saltiest body of the water and can support no life forms. The Rub-al-khali desert, also
known as ‘Empty Quarter’ is the largest uninterrupted stretch of sand on Earth. It covers
some 650,000 sq.km. and is one of the world's
driest and most-hostile deserts. The Iranian plateau in Central Iran is a vast semi-arid plateau,
which rises steeply from the coastal lowlands
bordering the gulf. It is ringed by high Zagros
and Elburz mountains.
<br>
<br>
<b>Climate</b>
<br>
<br>
Most of the regions receive very little rainfall, apart from a few isolated pockets. During
July, temperature soars, but in January temperature is much cooler, especially in the north.
<br>
<br>
<b>Population</b>
<br>
<br>
The desert has kept much of the population clustered along the coastal area. Most
people live in the cities, some of them are the
fastest growing in the world. Oman and Yemen
have mainly rural populations, and in Saudi
Arabia, small groups of Bedouin tribe people
roam the desert with their animals.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

The Oil and Natural Gas continue to be
the main source of income for many of the
countries here, although other industries are
being developed to support their economies
when these resources run out. Iran is famous
for its carpet, which are woven from wool or
silk.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Farming and Land Uses</i></strong></div>

The best farmland is found along the Mediterranean coast, and in the fertile valley of the
Tigris, Euphrates and Jordon river. Wheat is
the main cereal crops, and cotton, dates, citrus
and orchard fruits are grown for export. Elsewhere, modern irrigation techniques have created patches of fertile land in desert. Dates,
wheat and coffee are cultivated in the oases
and along the gulf coast.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>South Asia</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

The South Asia consists of Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
Its landscape ranges from the mighty peaks of
the Himalayas in North, through vast plains
and arid deserts to tropical forest and 
palmfringed beaches in the south. A massive towering wall of snow-capped mountains stretches
in an arc across the continents. 
The huge floodplains and deltas of the Indus, Ganges and the
Brahmaputra rivers separate the mountains
from the rest of the peninsula, a great rolling
plateau bordered on either side by coastal hills
called the Eastern and Western Ghats. The
Himalayas are the highest mountain system in
the world. The northern range of the Himalayas
average 7,000 m in height. They include the
highest point on Earth, Mount Everest on the
Nepal and China border which soars to 8,848
m. Much of the Bangladesh lies in the enormous delta formed by Brahmaputra and
Ganges rivers. During the summer monsoon,
the rivers become swollen by the torrential rain
and meltwaters from Himalayas and the delta
flood. The Deccan Plateau makes up most of
the central and southern India. Its volcanic rock
has been deeply cut by rivers such as the
Krishna, creating stepped valley called "traps".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate</i></strong></div>

Climate is strongly influenced by the annual monsoon between July and September
which brings hot, humid condition and extremely high levels of rainfall to much of the
regions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

Industry has expanded in India in recent
years, and in cities a varieties of goods are produced and processed, including cars,
aeroplanes, chemicals, food and drink. Services
industries such as tourism and banking are also
growing elsewhere. Small scale cottage industry serve the need of local people, but many
product, mainly silk and cotton textiles, clothing leather and jewellery are also exported.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>

Most of the South Asia's people live in villages scattered across the fertile river floodplains
in mountain valley or along the coast, but increasing number are migrating to the cities in
search of work. Overcrowding is a serious problem in both rural and urban areas. In many
cities thousands of people are forced to live in
slums or on streets.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Farming and Land Use</i></strong></div>

Over 60 per cent of the population involved
in agriculture, but most farmers are small and
produce only enough food to feed the family.
Grains are the staple food crop- rice is grown
in the wetter parts of the east and west, corn
and millet on the Deccan Plateau, and wheat
in north. Groundnuts are widely grown as a
source of cooking oil. Cash crops include tea
and jute.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>South East Asia</i></strong></div>

South East Asia chiefly consists of the countries like Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand, Vietnam. On the mainland, a belt of
mountain range clocked in thick forest, run
north-south. The mountains are cut through
by the wide valley of five great rivers. On their
route to sea, these rivers have deposited sediments forming immense, 
fertile flood plains and deltas. To the southeast of the mainland lies
huge arc of over 20,000 mountainous volcanic
islands. "Borneo" is the world's third largest
islands with total area of 757,000 km. Lying on
the Equator and in the path of two monsoon,
the island is hot and one of the wettest places
on the Earth. The Mekong river flows through
southern China and Myanmar and forms much
of the border between Laos and Thailand. It
then travels through Cambodia before ending
in a vast delta on the southern coast of Vietnam, 
that is one of the world's most productive rice growing area. Indonesia is the world's
most active volcanic region of the world. Java
alone has over 50 active volcanoes out of the
country's total of more than 220. The Philippines' 7000 islands are mountainous and volcanic with narrow coastal plains. Irian Java is
a province of Indonesia. Its dense rainforests
are some of the lasts unexplored areas on the
Earth and are inhabited by many rare plants
and animal species. Indonesia is an archipelago
of 13,677 islands, scattered over almost 5,000
km. The islands lie on the boundary between
two of the Earth's tectonic plates and frequently
experience earthquakes.
<br>
<br>
<b>Climate:</b> The Southeast Asia's climate is
strongly affected by the Monsoon which brings
warm humid air and high rainfall to mainland
Southeast Asia during July and to maritime
Southeast Asia during January.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

Industries based on the processing of raw
materials like Metallic mineral, timber, oil and
gas and agricultural produce, are important
here but manufacturing has grown dramatically in recent years. Many foreign firms attracted by low labour cost, have invested in
the region. Malaysia and Singapore are major
producers of electronic goods like disk drives
for computers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Farming and Land Use</i></strong></div>

The staple crop here is rice which grows in
low-lying flooded fields called Paddies, or on
terraces cut into the hillside. Sugarcane, coconut, bananas and pineapples are widely grown
as cash crops and Malaysia produces 25% of
the World's rubber. Freshwater and Marine fish
are caught in large quantities. Fish is one of the
main foods in the region.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>

The population is chiefly concentrated in
the river valley, plateaus or plains. Upland
areas are inhabited by small groups of hills
peoples. Most people still live in rural areas,
but the cities are growing fast. In Indonesia
and Philippines, the population is unequally
distributed. Some islands such as Java are
densely settled.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>East Asia</i></strong></div>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

It mainly consists of China, Mongolia and Taiwan. China's landscape divides into three
areas. The vast plateau of Tibet in the southwest is the highest and largest plateau on Earth.
It contains both dry deserts and pockets of
pasture surrounded by high mountains. Northwest China has dry highlands. The great plains
of eastern China were formed from soil deposited by rivers like the Yellow river over thousands of years. Most of Mongolia is dry grassland, steppe and cold arid deserts. The arid
landscape of the Gobi and Takla Makan desert
are made up of bare rock surface and huge
areas of shifting sand dunes. They are hot in
the summer, but unlike most other deserts, are
extremely cold in winter. In the farming areas
of Eastern and Southern China, terraces have
been carved into the hillside to make them flat
enough to grow rice and other crops. "The Tien
Shan Mountain" or "Heavenly Mountain"
reaches a height of 7,435 m. They surround
fields of permanent ice and spectacular glaciers. The Roof of the World or cold remote
plateau of Tibet has 4,000 m average height.
Many of China's great rivers have their sources
here. The world's highest human settlement a
town called Wenquan is found in the east of
the plateau. It lies 5,099 m above the sea level.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate</i></strong></div>

Two air masses control climate, one cold
and dry from Siberia and one moist and dry
from Pacific. Winters are long and cold away
from the coast- especially on the plateau of
Tibet.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

Chemicals, iron and steel, engineering and
textile are the main industries in China's east
coast cities and in industrial centres like
Shenyang. Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing
are also financial centres. In the interior large
deposit of coal support the heavy industries in
major cities such as Chengdu and Wuhan.
Taiwan specializes in textile and shoe manufacture, along with electronic goods. Mongolia's
economy is mainly agricultural.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>


Most of the China's people live in the eastern part of the country where the climate, landscape and soils are most favourable. Urban
areas cover the houses of over 250 million
people, but almost 75% of the population lives
in villages and farm the land. Taiwan's lowlands are very densely populated. In Mongolia,
about 50 per cent of the people live in the
countryside.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Farming and Lane Use</i></strong></div>

About the 90 per cent of China is unsuitable for farming. Either the soil and climate are
poor, or the landscape is too mountainous. In
the North and West, most farmers make their
living by herding animals. On the fertile eastern plain, soyabean, wheat corn and cotton
are grown. Further south, rice becomes the main
crops and pigs are raised in large number.
 The three Gorge hydro-electric scheme on
the Yangtze River will be the world's largest.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Japan And Korea</i></strong></div>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

It chiefly consists of Japan, North Korea
and South Korea. Japan is curved chain of 4,000
islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is covered by
forested mountains and hills, fast flowing rivers and small lakes. Only about a quarter of
the land is suitable for building and farming
and new land has been created by cutting back
hillsides and reclaiming land from the sea. The
North and South Korea are mostly mountainous, with some coastal plains. Japan's four main
islands- Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and
Kyushu were formed when two giant plates
making up the Earth's crust collided making
their edge buckle upward. T'aebeak-Sanmaek,
a wooded mountain range forms the backbone
of the Korean Peninsula. It runs from north to
south close to the east coast. Huge sea-waves
called "Tsunamis" frequently threaten the east
coast of Japan. They are set off by submarine
earthquakes. In Japan, earthquakes are parts
of everyday life. The islands lie on a fault line
and earthquake tremours occur, on average
5,000 times a year. Japan's mountain ranges
are studded with volcanoes, 60 of which are
still active. Mount Fuji is a 3,776 m snow
capped volcano and the highest mountain in
Japan. It last erupted in 1707.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate</i></strong></div>

Korea has hot summer and dry, very cold
winters especially in the North, where snow is
very common. In Japan winters are less cold
and in the Asian mainland summer are hot,
wet and humid.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

Japan is the world leader in hi-tech electronic goods like computers, televisions and
cameras as well as cars. South Korea also has
a thriving economy. It produces ships, cars, hitech goods, shoes and clothes for worldwide
export. Both countries have to import most of
their raw materials and energy. North Korea
has little trade with other countries but it is
rich in minerals and energy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>

Approximately about 125 million people live
in crowded cities on the coast of the four main
islands. The Kanto plain around Tokyo is
Japan's biggest area of flat land, and most of
the populous part of the country. In South
Korea, a quarter of the population lives in capital Seoul. Most North Koreans live on the
coastal plains.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Farming and Land Use</i></strong></div>

The method of farming allows Japan to
grow much of its own food, despite a shortage
of farmland. Rice is the main crops grown
throughout the region. Japan has a large fishing fleet. The Japanese eat more fish than any
other nation. In North Korea farming is controlled by the government.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Central Asia</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

Central Asia consists of the countries like
Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. It is a land of
hot, dry deserts and high rugged mountains.
Two of the world's great deserts, the Kara Kum
and Kyzyl Kum cover much of the Western
portions of Central Asia. In the east, a belt of
high mountain ranges- the Hindu Kush, The
Tien Shan and the Pamirs- tower above the
land. Few rivers cross the deserts, apart from
Amu Darya which flows from the Pamir to the
shrinking Aral Sea. The Aral Sea was once the
fourth largest lake in the World, but it has
shrunk by 40% since 1960. Diversion of its water
for irrigation has made the lake shallower, so
its water evaporates faster. The sandy desert of
Kara Kum occupies over 70%, of Turkmenistan.
Its surface consists of wind sculpted dunes and
depressions. The stress and strain in the Earth
created the Fergana Valley, a deep depression
encircled high mountains. The valley's fertile
soil is irrigated by water from the Darya River
and underground source. Pamir lies mainly in
Tajikistan. Their highest point at 7,495 m is
Communism Peak, so named because it was
the highest peak in former Soviet Union.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate</i></strong></div>

Central Asian climate is strongly influenced
by the position deep within Asia, far from the
moderating effects of the ocean, winters are
cold and summers are hot everywhere. Rainfall is virtually non-existent all year around.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Industry</i></strong></div>

The fossil fuel especially coal, natural gas
and oil are extracted and processed throughout Central Asia. Agriculture supplies the raw
material for many industries including food and
textile processing and the manufacture of
leather goods and clothing. The region is famous for its colourful traditional carpets, hand
woven from the wool of Karakul Sheep. The
"Fargana Valley" of southeast of Tashkent is
the main industrial area.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>

Most of the people of Central Asia are rural
farmers living in the river valley and in oases.
There are few larger cities. A few still lead a
traditional nomadic lifestyle, moving from place
to place with their animals in search of new
pastures. Large area of Afghanistan and western deserts and mountain regions in the east
are virtually uninhabited.
Farming and Land-Use
Farming is concentrated around the fertile
river valley. A variety of cereals and fruits including peaches, melons and apricots are
grown. In drier areas, animal breeding is important, with goats, sheep and cattle supplying wool, meat and hides. Big crops of cotton,
which is a major export, are produced on land
irrigated by the Amu Darya River.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Russia</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

To the east of the Ural Mountains lies the
West Siberian Plain-the world's biggest area of
flat ground. The plain gradually rises to the
Central Siberian Plateau, and again to 
highlands in southeast. Great coniferous forest called
Taiga, stretcher across most of these lands. The
far north of Siberia extends into the Arctic
Circle. There, the landscape is made up of frozen plains called "Tundra". Much of the
Kazakhstan is covered by huge rolling grasslands or Steppes; in the south are arid sandy
deserts. The Tundra and Taiga are stubby birch
trees, dwarf bushes, moss and lichen huddle
close to the ground in frozen Tundra wastes of
Northern Russia. They lie between the permanent ice and snow of the Arctic, and the thick
Taiga forests which covers an area greater than
the Amazon rainforest. The Caspian Sea covers 371,000 sq. km and is the world's largest
expanse of inland water. It is fed by the Volga
and Ural rivers which flow in from the plains
of the north. The West Siberian Plain is covered with a network of mashes and streams.
The Ob rivers which winds its way north across
the plain, is frozen for up to half the year.
Lake Baikal is the deepest lake in the world
and the largest freshwater one; it is more than
1.6 km deep and covers 32,500 sq. km. It is fed
by 336 rivers and contains around 20% of all
fresh water in the world.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Farming and Land-Use</i></strong></div>

The harsh climate of Siberia has restricted
farming to the south where there are a few
areas. Warm enough to grow cereals crops, such
as wheat and oats, and to raise cattle on the
small pocket of pasture. The rest of the region
is used for hunting, herding Reindeer and forestry- the Taiga forests contains the world's
biggest timber reserves. In Kazakhstan, big
herds of cattle, goats and sheep are raised for
wool and meat and wheat is cultivated in fertile north.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate</i></strong></div>

Russia and Kazakhstan have strongly continental climate and their distance away from
sea and ocean means that temperature fluctuates wildly both daily and seasonally. Temperature in eastern Siberia has been known to reach
-68°C.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Population</i></strong></div>

Siberia has some of the world's largest area
of uninhabited land. The bitingly cold climate
and harsh living conditions have kept the population small. The industrial cities in the West
hold the most people. Despite its huge size
Kazakhstan has only 17 million people; most
of whom live in urban areas.
