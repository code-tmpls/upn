<h3>Australia</h3>


It was British captain James Cook who first
made voyage to the country in the 1770s. In
1778 captain Arthur Phillip unlocked Australia to the world. The present day boundary of
Australia was delimited only in 1861. It was
only after protected negotiations that the Commonwealth of Australia comprising New South
Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia,
Western Australia and Tasmania came into being in 1901. The federation of Australia chiefly
comprises these 6 states and two federal territories, the northern territory and the Australian capital territory of Canberra.
The term Oceania is used to denote the
widely scattered islands of the central south
Pacific; Australia and New Zealand are also
frequently included in Oceania. The total population of Oceania was 31 million in 2001. Virtually, all the islands of the Oceania are either
volcanic peaks or tiny coralline atolls built on
submerged volcanic bases. Some of the islands
such as New Guinea are sizeable land areas
having snowcapped peaks as high as 5,000 m.
The continent of Australia, however, shows no
evidence of recent volcanism. Except for New
Zealand and part of Australia, the whole of
Oceania lies well within the tropics and enjoys
continuous warm temperatures. The annual
rainfall in Oceania may reach 400 cm in some
locations. Two-thirds of Australia, a number of
equatorial atolls and the leeward sides of mountainous islands tend to be arid.

<b>Oceania consists of:</b>

    <ul>
        <li>Australia and New Zealand</li>
        <li>Melanesia</li>
        <li>Micronesia</li>

Both Australia and New Zealand have minorities of indigenous inhabitants. The native
Australian people are known as 'aboriginals',
their population is about 260,000, living mainly
in the tropical north and in the arid and semiarid areas of the country. In New Zealand, the
dominant indigenous group is Maori - a
Polynesian people. They are concentrated in
the Northern Island. Maoris at present constitute about 10 per cent of the total population
of the country and their population is growing
at a faster rate.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

In comparison to other continents, Australia has diverse physical features. From the
mountain ranges like the Great Dividing Range
of Kimberly plateau to Nullarbor Plains and
Great Australian Deserts. The two most important 
rivers of Australia are "Murray" and "Darling" The Great dividing Range in the east is
not a fold mountain but only an edge of plateau which slopes gently from the east to the
west. It is not continuous and exists as the Blue
Mountain in New South Wales and as the Australian Alps in Victoria. It extends from Cape
York in the north along the coast of Tasmania
in the south. Mt. Kosciusko is the highest peak
in Australia. Lying between the western plateau 
and eastern high land are the central lowlands, made up of Carpentaria lowland in the
north. Lake Eyre basin lies in the middle - 
Darling basin in the south. Some of the important
physical features are: Lake Eyre and Great
Artesian Basin. The Western plateau or "Australian Outbreak" includes both steppe and
desert climate types. The important deserts 
include "Gibson", "Simpson", "Great Victoria" and
the "Great Sandy desert". The "Great Barrier
Reef", the longest coral reef in the world, is
situated on the north - eastern cost of Australia.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate and Vegetation</i></strong></div>

It is the Tropic of Capricorn which cuts
the continent into the northern and southern
parts. The climatic condition of the entire 
continent is defined by the Eastern Highlands and
monsoonal circulation. The northern and the
northeastern Australia have tropical monsoon
and Tropical marine climate, a modified form
of the tropical monsoon. The region is known
for deciduous forest, onshore trade winds and
uniformly distributed rainfall. The "Natal type
of climate" is found in the south- eastern parts.
Here the rainfall is uneven and annual temperature is very low. The "Southerly Buster "is
a violent cold wind blowing along the coast of
New South Wales. In this zone, the vegetation
is luxuriant with temperate "Eucalyptus" dominating the Australian Alps of Victoria and the
Blue mountains of New South Wales.
<br>
<br>
The Mediterranean type of climate is found
in the southern coast of Australia which is
characterized by warm dry summer and cool
moist winters. The Eucalyptus trees are more
common while "Jarrah" and "Karri" are commercially most important.
The "British type" of climate is found in the
inlands of Tasmania and New Zealand. Temperate Eucalyptus is found in Tasmania, while
coniferous can be seen on the higher slope of
southern Alps in New Zealand.
<br>
<br>
Most of the parts of Australia is characterized by the arid and semi - arid vegetation.
The Great Australian desert is next only to the
Sahara. The natural vegetation here is xerophytic, adapted to low moisture high salinity
and low humus content. In the northwest especially on the Kimberly plateau, the famed
"Bottle trees" can be found. The trees are of
bottle- shaped and store water in their bulbous
trunk.
<br>
<br>
There are two type of grassland in Australia - the "tropical" and the "temperate". The
tropical Savanna Grasslands are found in the
North and are marked by hot rainy and cool
dry season with extreme diurnal range of temperature. Their natural Vegetation consists of
the tall and coarse grasses with deciduous trees.
The species like "Mallee" and "Mulga" are found
in the scrub of this forest. The temperate grassland of the south are called "Downs". It is characterized by continentality, extreme of temperature and high annual precipitation. The entire
region of Australia is famous for sheep rearing
and the world's largest number of sheeps are
found here.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economy</i></strong></div>

The wool, meat and wheat have been the
country's top three income earners. The cattle
are reared in the wetter regions that allow better growth of grasses. It is mainly an agricultural nation, but only 5 per cent of the land is
under cultivation and agriculture is mainly carried on the south western and southeastern
parts and eastern coastal areas. Wheat, the most
important crop of Australia, is grown mainly
in New South Wales and Western Australia.
The commercial grain farming is big business
in Australia. Australia is also endowed with
the diverse mineral resource. The "Gold rush"
started with the discovery of Gold in Victoria
and New South Wales in 1851. At present,
minerals exports contribute significantly to the
country's economy. Japan is the largest importer. Its fairly diversified manufacturing sector is concentrated in Victoria and New South
Wales. Australia is basically dependent on the
exports of primary products which signify its
category into a developing rather in a developed economy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>About New Zealand</i></strong></div>

The small island "New Zealand" lies across
the Tasman Sea. It is the "Maoris" who first
inhabited here. Abel Tasman landed on the
island in 1640 from when the process of colonization started. New Zealand mainly consists
of two main islands - the North and the South
and a number of smaller ones. The south island is relatively longer than the North islands,
but they together constitute bigger in size that
the Great Britain. "Mt. Cook" is the highest peak
in New Zealand which lies in the Southern
Alps. The "Taranaki plain" is the slope of the
central highlands in North islands and an important pasture land. The "Canterbury Plains"
of the south island are also important for cattle.
The Europeans account for 85 per cent of the
total population while the "Maoris" constitute
only 10 percent. New Zealand is also one of
the foremost milk producing countries. The cold
and humid climate is very conducive for the
growth of nutritious grasses. The Canterbury
plain of New Zealand is well known for sheep
rearing and is the main farming regions of
"New Zealand."
