<h3>Anglo-America</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Introduction</i></strong></div>

The continent of Anglo-America comprises
the world's two largest countries- the United
States of America (USA) and Canada. In spite
of a wide range of socio-economic inequality,
diversity of national background and language,
the indigenous American culture is flourishing.
Its culture encourages the entrepreneurship,
development of skill and pursuit of excellence.
This is the reason why USA and Canada have
emerged as the two most developed countries
of the world. The natural resources have facilitated 
the development of ward's largest manufacturing complexes and as a result of it large
scale urbanisation. The entire agricultural
activities in the continent are mechanized, export oriented and commercial.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

The entire physiography of Anglo-America
varies from Swampy plains to high mountains.
Some of the well-known plains are "the Canadian Shield" the "Arctic Coastal Plain," the
"Gulf Atlantic Plain", the "Piedmont Plain" and
the "Interior Plains". The interior plains lie
mostly within the drainage basins of the rivers
Mississippi, Mackenzie, Saskatchewan and St
Lawrence. A large part of Canadian Shield is
covered with swamps and numbers of lakes of
glacial origin such as "Great Bear Winnipeg"
and the "Great Lakes". The "Appalachians",
"Western Cordillera" and "Interior Highland"
are some of the important highlands. The Arkansas river divides the interior highlands into
two major segments- the "Boston" and the
"Ozark" mountains in the north and "Ouachita"
Mountain" in the south. The mountain range
comprises the "Rocky Mountain" and "Sierra
Nevada". The "Great Basin" is the largest plateau basin. "St. Lawrence" and "Mackenzie"
river which flow northward are the important
rivers. The Mississippi flows southward.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate and Vegetation</i></strong></div>

The "non-tropical" type of climate is the
most prevalent one in Anglo-America except
Florida, where "tropical climatic" type is found.
The "Tundra Type of Climate" is found in areas from the Alaska to Labrador and
Greenland. The mean annual temperature is
very low in the region. Within the Arctic Circle,
there are weeks of continuous darkness or light.
The "cool temperate continental" or "Siberian"
or "Taiga" type of climate is found south of the
Tundra region. Here, the mean annual range
of temperature is very high and the precipitation is very low. The "Cool Temperate Eastern
Margin" or "Laurentia type" of climate is found
in south of Taiga. Here, deciduous trees species
oak, beech, maple and birch are important. The
"Cool Temperate Western Margin" or "British
type" of climatic condition is mainly found in
the north-west where westerlies influences may
be traced. Due to oceanic influence, the mean
annual temperature is not very large. The important species include elm, beech, poplar, alders and aspen. "The Warm Temperate Eastern Margin or China type" of climate is found
in the south-east. The annual rainfall is heavy
and well distributed throughout the year. The
occurrence of "tornadoes" and "twister" is very
common in this region. The "Warm Temperate
Western Margin or Mediterranean type" of climate is found in California. The summer is dry
and warm and the winter is moist. The "Desert
type" of climate is found in the region of
Mohave, Sonoran and California deserts. Bordering the desert, in the interior of the continents lies the temperate Grassland. It is almost
completely treeless. In North America, these are
called "Prairies". An interesting feature of the
Prairies is the hot local wind "Chinook" or
"Snow Eater". It blows down the eastern slopes
of Rockies. The Prairies is covered with Grass
and no trees. Species like "Low Willow", alders
and poplars are found here.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>USA</i></strong></div>

The USA is also known as the "Meltingpot of the world" because according to the latest
census report nearly 85 per cent of the US
population identified themselves with one of
more than 140 different national backgrounds.
Some of the important nationalities here are;
British Irish, French, Italian, Scandinavian,
African and more recently Chinese, Indian and
Korean. The immigrants have brought with
them different religions. The important ones are
Islam, Buddhism, Confucianism and Hinduism.
Nevertheless, Anglo-America remains Christian
dominated.
<br>
<br>
The North-East region of U.S.A. consists of
6 New England states; Maine, New Hampshire,
Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut and
Rhode Island and five middle Atlantic states;
New York, Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware,
Maryland and the districts of Columbia. These
areas are intensely developed and most densely
populated. These are also the most urbanized
region. The extraordinary urbanisation is the
by-product of industrialization in this region.
The old textile town "Lowell and Lawrence"
are the new avenues of employment.
The southern side includes the 14 states
and accounts for 25 per cent of the total area
and little over 30% of the population. This region has intermediate population density and
lower level of urbanisation. The economy of
the south is dominated by production of cash
crops for the world market. The cotton growing region has now shifted to Atlantic coastal
region of Georgia and South Carolina. Which
is also called "Sea-Island". By 1860, "the BlackBelt" extending from Alabama of Mississippi
had come to the principal centres of the U.S.A.
The Midwest includes 12 states and accounts
for 20 per cent of the total land area and approximately 25 per cent of the population. This
region is the leading producer of agricultural
products and manufactured goods. In value
term, the Midwest accounts for the 40 percent
of the total agricultural production. The industrial development decreases from east to west.

The Western region comprises 11 states and
accounts for 33 per cent of the land area and
20 percent of the population. In spite of water
shortage, the region accounts for 20 per cent of
the agricultural production. In southern California, the favorable climate and irrigation from
the mountain streams supports the production
of citrus fruits. Today the central valley is
highly productive. "Oregon and Washington"
are the leading producer of timber especially
softwood varieties like "Douglas fir". The "Silicon Valley" of San Francisco region is well
known for computers and biotechnology. The
"Boeing Company of aircraft manufacturing"
is located in Seattle. The copper in "Arizona"
and oil and coal in "Utah" is well known. The
western Pacific is now emerging as the world's
most economically dynamic region.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Canada</i></strong></div>

At present, Canada is one of the most industrialized and technologically advanced and
urbanized state of the world. The prominent
characteristic of Canada is the greater reliance
on the export of raw and semi-finished material while it imports the manufactured goods.
The overbearing influence on U.S.A. on Canada
has been a sure point to many Canadians who
think of themselves as "American Colony".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Aspect</i></strong></div>

A large part of Canadian population is concentrated around its border with the U.S. In
fact 70 to 80 percent of the population lives
within 160 km of the border. Canada's population cluster may be grouped into four main
regions:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Atlantic region in the northeast</li>
        <li>Culturally divided core region of maximum
population and development along the St.
Lawrence River in Ontario and Quebec</li>
        <li>the Prairies region of interior plains</li>
        <li>Vancouver region in the south-west.</li>

The easternmost of the Atlantic region is
most populated regions. It consists of the province of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova
Scotia and Prince Edward Islands. The Prince
Edward Island is a lowland occupied by farm
and small agglomerated settlement. The Labrador located on the mainland, is a part of the
province of Newfoundland. In this region, the
fishing industry is the most important. The
Atlantic province provides a hard environment
for agriculture. At present, agriculture is mainly
concentrated in very small patches of good land
dedicated to specialized farming. These include
the ''Prince Edward Island" and "AnnapolisCornwallis Valley" of Nova Scotia where potatoes and apple are grown. Prince Edward Island has the highest proportion of tilled land
of any Canadian province.
<br>
<br>
The core region of Canada consists of the
provinces of "Quebec" and "Ontario". In
Ontario, the American Midwest is repeated on
a somewhat smaller scale with corn and livestock production, dairy farming and other special crops like fruits and vegetables while in
Quebec, one find the "long lot" pattern of landholding with dairy farming being the predominant form of agriculture. This region produces
a wide variety of industrial products and accounts for more than ¾th of the Canada's
output. The "Ontario" is well-known for iron
and steel-industry. Other important industries
include automobiles and auto-spare parts.
In Quebec 82 per cent of the people speak
French and only 11 per cent speak English
while it is quite the reverse in Ontario. The
government in Quebec is French dominated.
The Prairies province or Pacific Region includes Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta.
This region is full of the tall Prairie grasses.
Agriculture is the basis of this region's economy.
Together these provinces produce around half
of the farm produce of Canada and sell about
a fifth of world's wheat exports. Of the three
Prairie Provinces, Saskatchewan, with nearly
20 per cent of the total employment in farming, is agriculturally the most important. In recent times, minerals, especially oil and natural
gas have become the foundation of advances
in the region's economy. Coal, potash, nickel,
copper, zinc and uranium are important minerals are mined in this region.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vancouver Region</i></strong></div>

This province lies within the high coast
range and Rockies. This pacific province of
British Columbia displays an environmental
difference from the rest of the Canada. It is
also a distinctive area, climatically, with British
type of climate. The province is also sparsely
populated with concentration of population
around the Vancouver. It consists of more than
10 percent of the land area but it has over half
of the province population. The economy of
this region is chiefly based on the primary products especially timber and minerals including
coal, oil and natural gas. This province is also
well developed in hydro electricity. The fishing
industry is also very well developed. In the
recent times, this region has also experienced
rapid urban growth.
<br>
<br>
The Canadian North comprises most of the
territory. The population is dispersed in a small
pockets along the southern fringe of the North
called "Near North" - the southern edge of the
sub-arctic climate zone. Mining settlements form
many of such pockets of population. Sudbury
and Ontario are the most important one. Metal
and paper industries are commonly found here.
The agriculture potential of this region is severely limited because of harsh climatic condition. The agricultural activities are mainly concentrated around the Sanguinary River, the clay
Belt of Ontario and Quebec, the Peace River
plain of Alberta and British Columbia.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Yukon and North-West Territory</i></strong></div>

This region is also known as "Territorial
Canada" which is in federal control and comprises over a third of Canada's areas. The population consists of Native Indians, Eskimos and
the people of mixed white origin. The white
people are primarily engaged in the service
sector while Red Indians and Eskimos still carry
on their traditional hunting and gathering activities. The Native Indians and the Eskimos,
on the other hand are generally unemployed
and dependent on state support. In the recent
time, the political assertiveness of the Indians
and Eskimos, who have demanded a greater
control over their affairs, has further delayed
the process of development.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Characteristic Facts</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Douglas fir: It is a type of tree species
used in timber industry. It is found in
the western USA especially in Washington and Oregon. The "Yellow" and
"loblolly pines" are important tree species. The state of British Columbia is most
important centre for the timber industry
in Canada. Canada is the largest producer of newsprint while USA of paper
and pulp.</li>
        <li>Grand Canyon: The Grand Canyon of
Colorado is the largest of its kind and is
famous for its stark natural beauty. It is
a deep-cut gorge with wall like side in
the soft rocks of Colorado plateau. In
the year 1869, J.W. Powell led a pioneering expedition down the Colorado
River through the Grand Canyon. He
remarked, "the canyons of this region
would be a Book of Revelation in the
rock-leaved Bible of Geology.</li>
        <li>NAFTA: It refers to the North American Free-Trade Area which is a type of
grand economic alliance of U.S.A,
Canada and Mexico. It has progressively
eliminated the barriers of trade-goods
and services which has also enabled the
formation of world's largest trade block.</li>
        <li>San Andreas Fault System: It is the largest fault system of 
            North America. It is inclined towards the north westerly direction 
            through much of western California. The fault is transformed boundary. 
            Due to the westward movement of the "pacific plate" earthquake are 
            frequently experienced in this region. Owing to the great length and complexity
of San Andreas Fault, it is more appropriately referred to as "fault system".</li>
        <li>Blizzard: It is an intensely cold and
strong wind accompanied by falling
snow found in the northern North
America. It is called "Buran" in Eurasia.</li>
        <li>The Rustbelt/the Old Metropolitan and
Sunbelt: These belts refer to the division
of U.S.A into two major categories. The
old metropolitan belt consists of those
towns which had attained prominence
by early 20th century which is growing
very slowly and in some parts is even
declining, especially in the Middle Atlantic belt and eastern Midwest. Such
area of declining is known as "Rustbelt".
The Rustbelt is characterized by outmoded buildings and equipment, depressed sales, high unemployment and
unattractive surrounding. The "Sunbelt"
on the other hand is a very elastic term
and includes most of the south and parts
of the west. It is best symbolized as "Silicon Valley" and "Sunny California". It
is characterized by faster growth of the
population and job.</li>
        <li>Corn-Belt: It is known for its Rectangular shape. This was prescribed in "1785"
by the Federal law. It has established a
system of uniformity in the entire U.S.A.</li>
        <li>Highway Technology: It refers to the
Highway 128 in eastern Massachusetts
because a large number of industrial
units, manufacturing industries and electronics industry are situated along the
roadways.</li>
        <li>Long-Lot: It refers to a type of landholding in "Quebec". It is a long narrow strip
of agricultural land which lies at right
angles to ribbons of comparatively dense
settlement along roads where the houses
and farm buildings have formed elongated village.</li>
        <li>Topanyms: It refers to the type of
Catholic settlement in the New World
or Quebec in USA. The Topanyms of
Quebec settled initially by the Catholics
and the New York state was settled by
the Protestants.</li>
        <li>Yeoman Farmers: It chiefly refers to the
migrated farmers who settled in Piedmont and Appalachians and established
semi-subsistence agriculture. The main
reason of migration is the spread of plantation industry in the south.</li>
        <li>Cajun French: It refers to the largest nonHispanic minority language group of
southern Louisiana. The French Settlement existed during the early 1700, but
the arrival of refugee group "Acadians"
who planted the French culture.</li>
