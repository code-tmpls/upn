<h3>South America</h3>

The continent of South America was originally discovered by Columbus. This fourth largest continent of the world has diversity of
physical landforms, people, culture and flora
and fauna. Therefore, it is also referred to as
the "new world". In comparison to other continents, it has experienced the forces of change
and its economy has ascended rapidly in the
market driven economy of the modern times.

The western part of continent is surrounded
by the "world's longest and highest" mountain
range "Andes". The Andes is a type of young
fold mountain which is more or less similar to
the Himalayas and run 7,000 km on the west
coast. "Mt. Ojas del Salado" in the Andes is the
highest active volcano in the world and "Mt
Aconcagua" is the highest peak. The two important highland outside the Andes; "Guiana
Massif" and "Brazilian Highland" are famous
for coffee plantation.
<br>
<br>
Some of the well-known rivers of the South
America are Amazon, Orinoco, Parana and
Paraguay. The river Parana forms the boundary between the Paraguay and Brazil. "Itiapu",
the largest dam of South America, is located
on it and generates 40% of the Brazil's electricity. The Guiana falls, with most voluminous
discharge in the world is also on the Parana
River.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate and Vegetation</i></strong></div>

The climate of South America is generally
hot because it lies within the tropical zone. The
equatorial type of climate is found in the entire
Amazon basin. The entire region is covered
with the tropical rainforests which is locally
known as "Selvas". The "balsa", the lightest
wood in the world, is found here. The Selvas
lies between the tropical grasslands called "Llanos" in the north and "Campos" in the south.
In this region, "Tropical Savanna Type" of climate is found. The southern part of the Campos is marked by a "warm temperate eastern
margin type of climate" or China type. There is
small annual range of temperature and rainfall. This region also experiences violent local
storms. In Argentina and Uruguay, a cold wind
called "Pampero" blows. It is accompanied by
the thunder and lightnings.
<br>
<br>
The northern part of Chile and the southern plateau experience a typical "hot desert type
of climate". The Atacama Desert", the driest in
the world, is a trade wind desert. "Patagonia"
a mid-latitude desert is another well-known
desert of South-America. It is a desert because
of "rain-shadow effect of the Andes".
<br>
<br>
The "Mediterranean type" of climate which
is characterized by warm dry summer and cool
moist winter is found in central Chile. The
natural vegetation here consists of the evergreen
trees having thick, shiny leaves which are able
to withstand the drought like conditions. The
trees of Oak, walnut and chestnut are abundantly found.
The British type or cool temperate western
Margin type of climate is found in the southern Chile. The natural vegetation is characterized by temperate mixed deciduous forest. The
Brazilian Highland and the south of Gran
Chaco are covered with the temperate grasslands called "Pampas" in Argentina. These
grasslands are particularly treeless. In the Pampas, the natural grass has been replaced by a
more nutritious leguminous variety called "Alfalfa".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Life</i></strong></div>

The people of South America belong to
three main racial group Amerindians, Black
and Europeans. The people of mixed origin such
as "Mestizos, "Mulattos" and "Zambos" are also
found. Mestizos form the largest group. The
persons of Indian origin have settled in
Surinam, Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago. The
most characteristic feature of the South American demography is the prevalence of high degree of urbanisation despite low level of technology and development. The rural to urban
migration is very high because of both the pull
and push factor. The entire economic activities
are centered around the agriculture and trade
in primary products. In the north-east Brazil,
plantation agriculture is practised. "Coffee" is
the chief crop of Brazil which is grown in the
south-eastern highlands and Andean templada.
The Mediterranean region of the Chile is suitable for the "Citrus fruits". The shifting agriculture is practised in the Selvas.
