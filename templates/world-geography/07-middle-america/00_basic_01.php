<h3>Middle America</h3>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

The "Middle America" comprises countries
from Mexico to Panama and all the islands of
Caribbean Sea. The mainland of the Middle
America which is the site of development of
the Meso-American culture is also a zone of
conflict. It chiefly consists of two regions
"Mexico" and "Central America" which includes
within it seven countries Guatemala, Belize, El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and
Panama. The size and population of Mexico
exceed the combined population and area of
all others Middle American countries put together.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Social Features</i></strong></div>

About 60 per cent of all the Mexicans are
"Mestizos" 25 per cent are Americans while
only 9 per cent are Armedians. In Mexico, two
way exchange of cultural change has occurred.
Here, Mexican Amerindians have been Europeanized while the modern Mexico is strongly
indianised. Some of the distinctive Mexican
modes of dress, cuisine and architectural style
also reflect Amerindian contribution. The largest number of Mexicans are Roman Catholics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate and Vegetartion</i></strong></div>

Over a half of Mexico lies to the North of
Tropic of Cancer and is dominated by desert
and steppe climatic type. The south of the
Tropic of Cancer is inhabited by huge population. Mexico's climate is marked by dryness particularly in the mountain-flanked north. It is
among the top five producers of agricultural
products such as sugarcane, citrus fruits, coffee and corn. The central Mexico region is too
high for Tierra Templada crops. The prevailing
Tierra Fria environment allows only such crops
which are resistant to frost damage. In the
northern, Mexico the "steppe" or "desert" type
of climate is found. "Lumbering" is important
economic activity here. The Gulf Tropics region of Mexico is the main producer of plantation crops including Cocoa, Sugarcane and
rubber.

also provided to Mexico, vast mineral wealth.

minerals of Mexico. Mexico still exports a major share of world's silver apart from copper,
zinc and lead. The yearly rate of growth of
Mexican population is nearly 2.3% and it is
expected that its population will double by 2025.
