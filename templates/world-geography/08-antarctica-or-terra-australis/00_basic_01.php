<h3>Antarctica Or Terra-Australis</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Landscape</i></strong></div>

The continent of Antarctica was chiefly discovered in the 20th century. It is the 5th largest of the seven continents. It is larger than
Europe and Australia and coldest and windiest of all. It is also called "Ice continent". Antarctica has the largest reserve of freshwater.
Nearly 11 per cent of the Antarctica's ice sheets
consist of ice - shelves which are massive floating slabs of permanent ice fringing the content.
The large rivers of the ice are called "glaciers".
These glaciers flow either into the ice shelves
or directly out of the edge of the continent,
where they break up from the iceberg.
The entire continent is dominated by TransAntarctic Mountains that separate the eastern
from the western part. These mountains hold
back the ice plateau of East Antarctica like a
massive dam and are deeply penetrated at
places by glaciers that flow into the ice shelves.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Climate and Weather</i></strong></div>

The climate of Antarctica is not uniform.
The high plateau region of East Antarctica yields
the lowest year round temperature while the
West Antarctica has a milder climate. The interior experiences almost continuous daylight
during summer and darkness during winter.
In the northward direction, there are fewer
days of continuous daylight and darkness. The
average annual rainfall is 5 cm making the
continent one of the driest deserts. Antarctica
experiences several unique optical phenomena
including the "Aurora Australis", "Mirage",
"Perihelion" and "Parselene".

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vegetation and Animal Life</i></strong></div>

The constant low temperature and high
moisture have limited the plant life almost
entirely to Protistas- simple and unicellular
organism. Here, only two varieties of flowering
western coast support the seaweeds and phytoplankton. Only microscopic and primitive
insects survive here. The southern part has
relatively wider variety of animal life including
Whale, Seals, Penguins and Albatross.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mineral Resource</i></strong></div>

A wide spectrum of mineral resources is
found in Antarctica. It consists of coal, copper,
lead, iron, molybdenum and others. The deposit of oil and natural gas is found in the
continental shelf region. According to the
Madrid Agreement of 1991, the use of these
mineral resources was banned for 50 years. It
has been done to save the ecology and environment of the Antarctica.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>National Claims of Antarctica</i></strong></div>

It was Roald Amundsen who first reached
South Pole in 1911. Antarctica has been partitioned into two pie- shaped sectors centered
on the South Pole. The "Peninsular Area" of
Antarctica has been in controversy where British, Argentinean and Chilean claims over
lapped. "Marie Byrd Land" is only sector of
such claims. "Antarctica is at least four times
as large as India and the southern ocean and
nearly as large as Atlantic".


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Antarctica Treaty System (ATS)</i></strong></div>

The International Geophysical year 1957-
58 was the year from where several nations
started to cooperate on scientific research in
Antarctica. After that several projects were
undertaken on diverse geophysical topics and
this led to the establishment of Scientific Committee on Antarctica Research (SCAR). It also
led to the development of "Antarctic Treaty" in
1959. In 1983, India was admitted as the consultative member.
This treaty is chiefly aimed at enhancing
the cooperation in Antarctica. According to this
treaty, Antarctica should be used only for the
peaceful purposes and prohibits military activities such as waste disposal and weapons Testing. The treaty envisages continued cooperation, mutual inspection of stations and exchange
of scientific personnel with the objective of
maintaining the ecological balance. The ATS
has also formulated several resolutions which
consist of:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Conservation of Antarctic marine living
resources.</li>
        <li>Protocol on environment protection.</li>
        <li>Agreed measures for conservation of
Antarctic's flora and fauna.</li>
        <li>Convention on Conservation of Antarctic
Seals.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Antarctica Fact File</i></strong></div>

<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Discovery of Antarctica: It was James Cook
who first crossed the Antarctica circle but
unable to discover anything. Firstly, Sir James
Clark Ross discovered the "Ross Sea", the
"Victoria Island" and the "Magnetic Pole".
In a race contest to South Pole, Robert F
Scott, and Roald Amundsen, participated.
On 14th December 1911, Norwegian,
Amundsen was able to beat Scott to victory.</li>
        <li>Southernmost Post Office: It is situated in
Antarctica and operated by a lady.</li>
        <li>Aurora Australis: It is the fantastic display
of light in characteristic colour, bands and
rings of various hues. It is caused by stream
of charged particles from the sun, entering
into the earth's upper atmosphere. A more
or less similar phenomena in the northern
hemisphere is called "Aurora Borealis".</li>
        <li>Fastest Antarctica Crossing: It is "Trans -
Antarctica" completed by Ranulph Fiennes,
Oliver Shepard and Charles Burton in 1980
- 82. It is also the leg of Trans - Globe
Expedition in 67 days from 28th October
1980 to 11th January 1981.</li>
        <li>Ozone Hole: It is the ozone - layer over the
continent of Antarctica which was discovered in mid 1970s. Its corresponding annual
hole was identified over the Arctic Ocean in
1986. This hole is most prominent during
the coldest seasons.</li>
        <li>Land of Ice: The entire Antarctica is covered with the ice sheet which is as thick as
1800 metres. If all the ice of it melts, the sea
would rise by 60 metres.</li>
        <li>Cold - Pole: It refers to the point with
lowest-mean annual temperature in each
hemisphere. In the northern hemisphere,
this is at "Verkhoyansk" in north - east
Siberia, Russia. In the south hemisphere, the
lowest recorded temperature has been at the
"Soviet Research Station" of Vostok on the
Antarctic ice plateau. "Vostok" and
"Verkhoyansk" are together known as the
"Cold Poles of the Earth".</li>
        <li>Southern Ocean: It includes southern portion of India. Atlantic and Pacific ocean and
is considered as a separate ocean due to its
uniform lower temperature and salt concentration,</li>
        <li>Ross - ice - shelf: It is the largest ice- shelf
in the world which is as large as France.</li>
        <li>Mt. Erebus: It is a type of active volcano
which, along with many other volcanoes,
dots the coastal and island regions.</li>
        <li>Vinson Massif: It is the highest Peak in
Antarctica.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
