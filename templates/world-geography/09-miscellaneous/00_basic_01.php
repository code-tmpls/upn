<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<b>Lake Victoria:</b> It is the largest Lake in
Africa and is the source of "White Nile". The
"Lake Tana" in Ethiopia is the source of "Blue
Nile". Both the White and the Blue Nile meet
at the capital city of Sudan, "Khartoum" from
where the combined stream is known as "Nile"
river. It is the longest river of the world. The
"Aswan dam" was built on it which forms the
largest man-made lake, "Lake Nasser".
River Zambezi: It is the largest river of
South Africa and natural political boundary
between Zambia and Zimbabwe. The famous
"Victoria fall" is situated on it. The "Kariba
Dam" of Africa is also situated on it.
River Zaire: It is only river in the world to
cross the equator twice. "Boyoma or Stanley
Falls" is situated on it.
<br>
<br>
<b>Guinea-Bissau:</b> It is the most rural country in the world. In total GDP, agriculture
contributes about 60% and it is also one of the
poorest countries of the world.
<br>
<br>
<b>Perforated State:</b> It is type of state whose
geographical boundary completely surrounds
that of another state. For example, S. Africa
encloses Lesotho and Swaziland.
<br>
<br>
<b>Gibraltar:</b> It is a gateway between Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. The stretch
between the steep "Rock of Gibraltar" and
"Cape Ceuta" is called "Pillars of Hercules".
The Great Rift Valley: It is in Africa and
runs from the south of lake Malawi to the
northward side of Red sea and then through
Gulf of Aquaba leads to Dead sea. The extensive volcanic activity believed to accompany
continental rifting is exemplified by the large
volcanic mountains such as Kilimanjaro and
Mount Kenya.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kalahari Desert:</b> It is situated between the
"Orange" and "Zambezi" river. The entire area
has the annual rainfall of less than 50 cm.
"Bushmen" is the aboriginal people of this
desert. They use to collect water in the Ostrich
eggshells in dried buck stomachs. They also
use to suck dew drops in the drier years.
<br>
<br>
<b>Barbary State:</b> The north-west African
countries of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are
called as Barbary States because of the region's
oldest inhabitants the Berbers. These three countries together constitute the "Maghreb". The region "Djezira-el-Maghreb" or "Isle of West" is
in recognition of Atlas Mountain rising like vast
inlands on the west coast of Mediterranean Sea.
<br>
<br>
<b>Balkans:</b> The entire region of Balkan Peninsula is bounded by Adriatic Aegean and Black
sea. It includes Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania and former Yugoslavia. Today the region has fragmented and it is referred as
"Balkanization" meaning disintegration.
<br>
<br>
<b>Discovery of Antarctic:</b> It was James Cook
who first cross the boundary of Antarctic Circle.
But they were not able to see the landscape.
<br>
<br>
Later on, Sir James Clark Ross discovered the
Ross Sea, the Victoria Island and South Magnetic Pole. Robert F. Scott and Ronald
Amundsen were the chief contestants.
Amundsen of Norway was able to beat Scott
to victory on 14th December 1911.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cold Pole:</b> It refers to the point with the
lowest mean annual temperature in each hemisphere. In the North hemisphere this is at
"Verkhoyansk" in North-East Siberia, Russia.
In the south hemisphere the lowest recorded
temperature has been at Soviet research station of Vostok on the Antarctic ice plateau.
Therefore, "Vostok" and "Verkhoyansk" together
called the cold pole of the earth.
<br>
<br>
<b>Bentley Subglacial Trench:</b> It is the deepest point in Antarctica. It is "2538" metres.
<br>
<br>
<b>Vinson Massif:</b> It is the highest peak in
Antarctica.
<br>
<br>
<b>Queen Maud Range:</b> It is the longest
mountain in Antarctica.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ross-ice-Shelf:</b> It is the largest "ice-shelf"
in the world which is as large as France.
<br>
<br>
<b>Magnetic Poles:</b> It may be classified into
"Magnetic North Pole" and the "Magnetic South
Pole", the former is located on the Prince of
Wales Island is North Canada while the later
is situated in South Victoria land, Antarctica.
<br>
<br>
<b>Aurora Australis:</b> The display of southern
light is characterized by colour bands and rings
of various hues. It is caused by the streams of
charged particles from the sun, entering into
the earth's upper atmosphere. A similar phenomenon in the northern hemisphere is "Aurora Borealis".
Hamites: It refers to the people of northern and eastern Africa, ancient Egypt and
Ethiopians.
<br>
<br>
<b>Semites:</b> It refers to the various ancient and
modern people originating in south-west Asia.
It consists of "Hebrews" and Arabs. It is also
used as the synonymous of the Jews.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kurds:</b> It chiefly refers to pastoral and war
like people of Kurdistan of south-east Turkey
and Iran. They are the classic example of stateless nation. A large number of Kurds are divided among the nation of Iraq, Iran, Turkey,
Syria and Jordon.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tuaregs:</b> It refers to the Berber and Hamite
speaking members of nomadic tribe of Sahara.
They wear blue-dyed cloth. The dye rubs off
their face and body are resembles with the blue
colours. Therefore, they are called "Tuaregs" or
the colour of blue.
<br>
<br>
<b>Aborigines:</b> The term chiefly refers to the
original inhabitants of any area such as Maoris
of New Zealand and Bushmen of Kalahari.
<br>
<br>
<b>Basques:</b> It chiefly refers to the pre-European people whose population is about 2 million and who inhabit the Pyrenees Mountain
in Northern Spain and south-west France. They
remained independent until the 19th century.
Kwajalein or Marshall Islands: It is the
largest atoll in the world where USA conducts
its missile tests.
<br>
<br>
<b>Most rainy days of the World:</b> Mt.
Waialeale Hawaii has upto 350 rainy days per
year.
<br>
<br>
<b>Pearl Harbour:</b> It is the US Naval base in
Honolulu, the Hawaiian capital. It is the place
where Japanese launched a bombing attack
during World War-II which was retaliated by
U.S.A. by dropping atom bomb on Hiroshima
and Nagasaki.
<br>
<br>
<b>Hawaii:</b> It is the pacific realm of Polynesia
which consists of 130 islands. It became the
5015 state of the U.S.A. Most of the Hawaiian
Islands are of volcanic origin and the vulcanization is related to the hot spot-activity. "Mauna
Loa" and "Mauna Kea" could be considered as
two of the tallest mountain peak of the world.
All major internal sea-route converge at Hawaii. That's why it is called "cross-road of the
Pacific".
<br>
<br>
<b>Earth Day:</b> The "April-22" is celebrated as
the earth day to recognize beauty and riches of
the earth. It also brought awareness about the
over population, energy waste and other significant issues. It was first observed on April22, 1970.
<br>
<br>
<b>San Andreas Fault:</b> It is a fracture in Earth's
crust that runs for more than 1000 kms of its
length. It cuts through the U.S mainland and
marks the meeting points of two plates e.g.
Pacific and American plates. The Pacific plate,
which is moving northwestward with respect
to North American plate, causes earthquakes
along the fault.
<br>
<br>
<b>Environmental Lapse Rate:</b> It refers to the
normal rate of temperature decrease with the
height. Normally the temperature decrease at
the rate of 10ºC for every 165 metres of height
above sea level. The higher layers of the atmosphere contain smaller quantities of water
vapour and carbon dioxide and hence their
capacity to absorb heat energy is much less
than that of lower layers. This is the reason
why Darjeeling, Nainital and Shimla is cooler
than Delhi.
<br>
<br>
<b>Artificial Rain:</b> The artificial rain is produced by introducing tiny particles of solid
carbon dioxide or crystal of silver iodide into
the clouds at cloud temerature above 0°C by
the process called "cloud seeding". The seeding
agent can be spread into a cloud from an air
plane or sent up in rockets. The water-vapour
in the cloud condenses around the seeding
agent.
<br>
<br>
<b>Hottest Place:</b> It is the Death Valley of
California in USA where temperature of over
49°C was recorded in July and August 1917.
<br>
<br>
<b>Coldest Place:</b> The Polyus Nedostypnosti
of Antarctica has an extrapolated annual mean
temperature of -58°C. The coldest measured annual temperature is -57°C. It was recorded at
plateau station of Antarctic. The coldest permanently inhabited place in the world is vil-
lage of "Oymyakon" in Siberia of Russia.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tornado:</b> It refers to the strongest known
atmospheric disturbances with the wind velocity exceeding 300 km/hr. It frequently occurs
in "Mississippi Valley" in the U.S. It is called
"Twister". The U.K. has the highest frequency
of Tornadoes by area. The highest speed of Tornado is 450 km/hr at Texas.
<br>
<br>
<b>Tides:</b> The periodic phenomenon of alternate rise and fall in Sea levels is known as
"tide". On the full moon and new moon, tides
are the highest and called "Spring Tides" while
"Neap Tides" is the tides of 1st and 3rd quarter. Generally the tide occurs twice a day; but
the "Southampton Coast" of England experiences tides four times a day. It occurs at regular intervals of 12 hours and 25 minutes. The
highest tides recorded in India at Okha,
Gujarat. The "Bay of Fundy" has the highest
tidal range. Lakes have no tides because moon's
gravitation pull is impossible in small body of
water such as lake.
<br>
<br>
<b>Artesian Well:</b> It is a type of well in which
rock layers are down folded into a basin shape
so that permeable strata may be sandwiched
between impermeable layers. The permeable
rocks only come to the surface at the edge of
the basin. The permeable layer below it prevents the water from passing downwards while
the impermeable layer on top prevents any
possibility of water escaping upward. Such a
structural basin is called "aquifer". The water
is trapped in the aquifer under great pressure
and when a well is bored, the pressure of water
all around the basin is sufficient to force the
water up to the bore hole so that it gushes into
the surface like a fountain. This type of well is
more valuable to man because it can be used in
Desert region.
<br>
<br>
<b>Rubber Trees:</b> It is chiefly found in the
"Amazon rainforest". Its scientific name is
"Hevea Brasiliensis". Latex is collected by slashing tree trunks. This is a destructive system, for
trees are over trapped and destroyed for profit.
With the establishment of rubber plantation in
south-east Asia, Amazon River lost its preeminent position.
<br>
<br>
<b>Desert of Atacama:</b> It is an arid type of
desert in northern Chile that extends 960 km
south from Peru border. It has no vegetation
and considered as the "Driest Desert of the
World". The 400 years of drought was recorded
in 1971 in the Calama town. The only stream
"Rio Loa" reaches the Pacific Ocean. It was
ceded to Chile by Peru and Bolivia in 1983-84.
Atacama Desert is rich in nitrates, iodine and
borax.
<br>
<br>
<b>Sao Paulo:</b> It is the third largest urban agglomeration in the world after Tokyo and
Mexico City. It is the largest urban agglomeration in the southern hemisphere. It accounts
for 22% of Brazil's population and 40% of the
country's GDP. It is also the leading industrial
region of America.
<br>
<br>
<b>Galapagos Islands:</b> It is situated on the
north-west of South American mainland and
is a part of Equator. The island is a home of
many unique species of reptiles, birds and
fishes.
<br>
<br>
<b>Forwarded Capital:</b> When a state relocates
its capital to sensitive areas, perhaps near a
zone of dispute with an unfriendly neighbour,
in part to confirm its determination to sustain
its position in that contested zone. Brasilia is
located on what has been an internal frontier
which has yet to be conquered by still developing Brazil. Another example of forward capital
is Islamabad.
<br>
<br>
<b>Ejidos:</b> They are the agricultural communities of Mexico. The privately owned hacienda
land was transferred to them after land reform
were instituted by the 1917 constitution. Like
cooperative in India, these present an achievement of the deal of land to the landless, but are
relatively less productive.
<br>
<br>
<b>Panama Canal:</b> It is connects the Atlantic
with the Pacific Ocean. It came into operation
in 1913. The U.S.A. had unilateral control of
the canal operation and was directly involved
in the administration of Panama Canal. But in
the year 2000, USA transferred the canal administration to the sovereign state of Panama.
The canal measures "64.8" km from Colon on
the Atlantic till Panama city on the Pacific and
has three locks; Pedro Miguel Lock, Mira Flores
Rock and Gatun Lock.
<br>
<br>
<b>Douglas Fir:</b> It is a type of leading tree
species used in the timber industry. It is the
most important trees of western USA especially
in Washington and Oregon. The Giant Sequoia
is mainly grown in California. The important
tree species here are yellow and loblolly pines.
The state of British Colombia is the most im-
portant centre of timber industry in Canada.
This is the reason why Canada is the largest
producer of Newsprint while USA of Pulp and
Paper.
<br>
<br>
<b>Highway of Technology:</b> It is also known
as "Highway 128 in eastern Massachusetts"
because of the concentration of industrial units
manufacturing advanced electronics along the
roadways.
<br>
<br>
<b>Prince Edward Island:</b> It is the smallest
island of Canada and the most densely populated province.
<br>
<br>
<b>Newfoundland:</b> It was the oldest British
colony and the last province to join Canada in
1949.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Antarctica Treaty - 1959</i></strong></div>

The International Geophysical year (1957-
58) envisaged the project on diverse geophysical topics and this led to the establishment of
"Scientific Committee on Antarctica Research".
It also led to the development of Antarctica
Treaty in 1959. India became its member in
1983. The treaty envisaged that Antarctica
should be used only for the peaceful purposes
and prohibits military activities. It provides
continued cooperation, exchange of scientific
personnel and mutual inspection of stations.
