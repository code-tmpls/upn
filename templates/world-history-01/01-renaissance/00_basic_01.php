<h3>Renaissance</h3>


The Enlightenment represents the clime of
the intellectual revolution in philosophy. It began
in England about 1680 and quickly spread to
most countries of northern Europe. It was not
without influence in America. But the supreme
manifestation of the Enlightenment was,
however, in France. The period of its real
importance was the eighteenth century. Few
other movements in history have had such great
effects in moulding men's thoughts on shaping
the course of their actions as the Enlightenment.
The Philosophy of enlightenment was built
around a number of significant concepts than.
Firstly, reason is the only infallible guide to
wisdom. All knowledge has its roots in sense
perception, but the impressions of our senses are
but the raw materials of truth, which has to be
refined in the crucible of reason before it can
have value in explaining the world or in showing
the way to improvement of life. Secondly, the
universe is a machine governed by inflexible laws
which man cannot override. The order of nature
is absolutely uniform and not subject in any way
to miracles or to any other form of divine
intervention. Thirdly, the best structure of society
is the one which is the simplest and most natural.
The life of the noble salvage is preferable to that
of a civilized man with its outworn conventions
which serve to perpetuate the tyranny of priests
and rulers. Every artificial thing was to be
removed from religion government and economic
institutions which should be reduced to a form
consistent with reason and natural liberty.
Fourthly, there is no such thing as original sin.
Men are not inherently deprived. Only the
scheming priests and depots who are eager for
making war drive them to acts of cruelty and
meanness. If men are allowed to follow freely
the guidance of reason and their own instincts,
the infinite perfectibility of human nature, and
therefore of the society itself, would be easily
realised.

Though the inspiration for the Enlightenment
has come partly from the nationalism of
Descartes, Spinoza and Holbes, the real founders
of the movement were Sir Issac Newton and Jon
Locke. It is true that Newton was not a
philosopher in the ordinary sense of the term.
But his work has a great significance for the
history of thought. He brought the whole world
of nature under a precise mechanical
interpretation. This was his greatest achievement.
His theory of gravitation was held to be valid
not only on this earth but throughout the vast
expense of the solar system. From this it was an
easy step to the conclusion that every event in
nature is governed by universal laws which can
be formulated as precisely as mathematical
principles. While the discovery of these laws is
the business of science, it is the duty of man to
allow them to operate unhindered. The old
medieval idea of a universe guided by benevolent
purpose now gave place to the idea that man
lived in a world in which procession of events
was automatic. Newton's philosophy did not
reject the idea of a God, but it deprived him of
his power to guide the star in their courses or to
order the seen to remain stationary.
Locke's influence was quite different from
that of Newton. He was the originator of a new
theory of knowledge which served as the cornerstone of the Enlightenment. He maintained that
man's knowledge originates from sense
perception. This is known as the theory of
sensationalism. He was the first modern
philosopher to develop it in systematic form,
though Hobbes had already asserted it earlier
than Locke. He asserted that the human mind at
birth is a blank tablet, containing nothing
inscribed on it. The (human mind) does not even
contain the idea of God or any notions of right
and wrong. Anything gets registered in the mind
of the new-born child only after the child begins
to have experiences, to perceive the external
world with its senses.
<br>
<br>
The simple ideas which result directly from
sense perception are merely foundations of
knowledge. Man, however, cannot live
intelligently on the basis of the simple ideas. These
simple ideas must therefore be integrated and
fused into complete ideas. This is the function of
reason or understanding. Reason has the power
to combine, coordinate, and organise the
impressions received from the senses.
It will thus be seen that sensation and reason
are both indispensable, one for furnishing the
mind with the raw materials of knowledge and
the other for working them into a meaningful
form. It was this combination of sensationalism
and rationalism which became one of the basic
elements in the philosophy of the Enlightenment.
Locke is also known for his defence of the
religious toleration and for his liberal political
theory.
<br>
<br>
The Enlightenment blossomed fourth in its
fullest glory in France during the eighteenth
century under the leadership of Voltaire and
other critics of the established order. Voltaire's
first philosophic work was “Letters on the
English” which he wrote in Britain where he
lived for three years, acquiring a deep admiration
for British institutions. In this work, he
popularised the ideas of Newton and Locke. Most
of his later writings the Philosophical Dictionary,
Candide, his histories and many of his essayswere also concerned with exposition of the
doctrine that the world is governed by natural
laws and that reason and concrete experience
are the only dependable guides for man to follow.
Voltaire is best known as a champion of
individual freedom. He considered all restrictions
upon liberty of speech and opinion as barbarous.
He hated most the tyranny of organised religion.
He condemned the monstrous cruelty of the
church in torturing and burning intelligent men
who were bold enough to question its dogmas.
His slogan was 'crush the infamous thing' with
reference to the whole system of persecuting and
privileged orthodoxy. He was almost unsparing
in this attacks on political tyranny, especially
when it resulted in the massacre of thousands to
glut the ambitions of the despots.
Two other philosophers, Davind Hume, a
Scotsman and Rousseau, a Frenchman, are
commonly given a place in the Enlightenment
even though neither of them was in full
agreement with the majority of his
contemporaries. The former is known for his
skepticism. He taught that the mind is a mere
bundle of impressions, derived exclusively from
the senses and tied together by habits of
association, i.e. we learn from experience to
associate warmth with fire. If we had never
actually experienced the sensation of warmth,
no reasoning faculty in our minds would enable
us to draw the conclusion that fire produces heat
. But constant repetition of the fact that when
we see a flame we generally experience warmth
leads to the habit of associating the two in our
minds. Impressions and associations are all that
there is to knowing. Since every idea in the mind
is nothing but a copy of a sense impression, it
follows that one can know nothing of final
causes, the nature of substance, or the origin of
the universe. We cannot be sure of any of the
conclusions of reason except those which can be
verified by actual experience. All others are likely
to be the products of feelings and desires, of
animal urges and fears. But denying the
competence of reason, Hume placed himself
almost wholly outside the main intellectual trend
of the Enlightenment. Hence it is said that he
helped to prepare its death.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Jean-Jacques Rousseau:</i></strong></div>

Rousseau repudiated may of the basic
assumptions which emerged from Newton and
Locke. He maintained that reason cannot be
depended upon as the infallible guide to conduct
and truth. Though reason has its uses, it is not
the full answer. In the really vital problems of
life it is much safer to depend on feelings, to
follow our instincts and emotions. Since these
are ways of nature, they are more conducive to
happiness than the artificial lucubration of the
intellect. To Rousseau, the thinking man is a
depraved animal. Not withstanding his contempt
for reason, he was in other ways completely in
agreement with the viewpoint of the
Enlightenment.
<br>
<br>
In his Discourse on the Arts and Sciences he
contrasted the freedom and innocence of
primitive men with the tyranny and wickedness
of the civilized society. He even went to the extent
of insisting that the progress of learning is
destructive of human happiness. Like all other
reformers he shared the impatience of the
Enlightenment with every sort of restriction upon
individual freedom. But he was much more
concerned about the liberty and equality of the
masses than other reformers of his time. He
considered the origin of private property as the
primary source of misery in human society.
Rousseau is commonly considered the father
of romanticism as he was the first significant
writer to uphold the validity of conclusions
dictated by emotion and sentiment. His slogan
'back to nature' provided the foundation for a
veritable cult dedicated to the pursuit of the
simple life. His influence, however, was not
confined only to the founding of romanticism
and the encouragement of sentimental devotion
to nature. His dogmas of equality and popular
sovereignty became the rallying cries of
revolutionaries and of thousands of more
moderate opponents of the existing regime. It is
no exaggeration to say that it was his political
philosophy which provided the real inspiration
for the modern ideal of the rule of the majority.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Immanuel Kant:</i></strong></div>

Immanuel Kant devoted most of his time in
teaching and matured his philosophic ideas very
slowly. For a long time he spoke scornfully of
the meta physicians as those who dwelt on the
high towers of abstruse cogitation, “where there
is a great deal of wind”. He finished his first
great work the critique of Pure Reason, when he
was on the other side of fifty. He owed a great
deal to the minds of the Enlightenment. They
contributed to his political ideas. Kant believed
in the natural rights of men and or defended the
separation of powers as a necessary protection
for the liberty of the citizens.
However, in the field of general philosophy
Kant departed widely from the rationalism of
the eighteenth century.
<br>
<br>
He gave the greatest importance to the
concept of moral will and freedom. In this he
drew upon Rousseau and asserted that if a person
is allowed to act according to his morals he will
attain freedom. He laid stress on moral nature
and did not consider material progress as progress
at all. Kant did not subordinate individual to
state nor did he approve of state control over
individuals. Like other individualists he
considered state a necessary evil. State is all
powerful and whatever freedom the individual
surrenders to the state he gets it back in the form
of assurance from the state to protect his freedom
from any outside agency. This enlarges the sphere
of his freedom.
Kant is criticized for advocating and justifying
the existence of an absolute monarchy on the
other. He gave too much importance to moral
freedom and inspite of his idealism leaned
towards individualism. However this gave birth
to liberalism and aroused a desire among the
people to form representative institutions. They
also awakened the spirit of nationalism and
national integration.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rousseau:</i></strong></div>

The slogans of equality, liberty and fraternity
during the French Revolution were inspired by
his ideas. His ideas left an indelible effect upon
the French Revolution. Napoleon has truly stated
that “If Rousseau had not taken birth, the
emergence of French Revolution would have been
impossible.
