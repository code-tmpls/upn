<h3>American Revolution</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>American Revolution and American
Constitution:</i></strong></div>

After the seventeenth century France,
Holland and England began to expand their
trading activities and to establish colonies in
America. The USA was subjugated by Great
Britain during the early 18th century but the
subjugation could not last long because of two
significant ideals – freedom and equality- which
emerged strongly in the 18th century in Europe
and in America. The occurrence of some events
and the emergence of certain thoughts between
1775 and 1783 gave birth to a new nation.
The history of the American war of
Independence is a record of severe struggle for
its redemption from the sovereignty of England.
That glorious struggle was launched by the
American colonies to regain their freedom against
the desire of England and to oppose its stringent
colonial policy. It is true that the immediate cause
of the American Revolution lays in the imposition
of undue taxes upon the colonists, but there were
several other causes also. On the one side, the
Americans were not prepared to bear with their
subjugation under the British sovereignty and
on the other after 1763 the British government
formulated and followed such policies, as could
reinforce their control over the American Colonies
better than it was earlier.
<br>
<br>
People migrated from Europe to American
colonies to get rid of the war of genocide going
on constantly in Europe. The poor were sold to
the rich and the governing class to be as slaves
in war. In order to avoid such a grievous fate,
people thought it better to migrate to the
American colonies. Most European immigrants
left their countries with an intention to earn profit
in American Colonies. The immigration was
strengthened by the people’s desire to escape
political tortures and to get religious freedom.
People thought that in the American colonies
they would be able to worship God freely and
get redemption from the European religious and
communal persecution and suppression and there
would be neither the pressure of the church nor
the governing classes.
<br>
<br>
Position of America before the revolution:
In all there were 13 English colonies from
Maine in the north to Georgia in the south.
Between 1713 and 1763 numerous English, Scot,
German and French immigrants settled in these
colonies. The prices of all the American products
like wood, leather, tobacco, sugar, copper and
fish increased rapidly in England and Europe,
which made the Americans richer. The
continuous prosperity which lasted 50 years
enhanced the status of Americans in the world.
Some American journals like the Gazette, The
New York Reporter became popular in Europe
and their demand increased there. Many famous
universities like Princeton, Yale, Dart-Mouth,
Brown etc. had already been established before
the revolution.
The colonial culture was a hybrid culture. There
were two reasons that contributed to the
emergence of a hybrid culture in the American
colonies. Firstly, the People who had settled in
these Colonies came from different regions of
Europe and belonged to various sects and these
Colonies had different forms of government and
distinct laws. Secondly, they had various sources
of livelihood. Therefore, there emerged a special
culture which contained the strands of various
elements. The people faced identical problems
and had to seek a joint solution. In this way,
they patched up their differences gradually for
the sake of their existence and developed a
specific culture which proved to be very
significant although it resembled the European
culture.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Causes of the American Revolution:</i></strong></div>

The American struggle for freedom was a
conflict of economic interests primarily between
Great Britain and her Colonies. But from many
angles, it was a revolt against the social and
political system of that time which had lost its
significance for America. In other words
economic, political, social and religious forces
worked together in American revolution. The
American Colonies rose in rebellion in order to
retain their liberty, freedom and autonomy. It is
noteworthy that the colonists lived in diversity
and most people did not have causes of complaint
against England; even then certain circumstances
bound them in unity.
<br>
<br>
One of the main causes of American
revolution was the clash in ideas and principles
held dear by the native of England and the
American colonists. Colonists did not intend to
snap political connection from their motherland
but they were not prepared to see the colonies
exploited for profit only. They wanted equality
and autonomous rule for themselves. The middle
class hated the privileges and luxuries enjoyed
by the colonial rulers. This class desired the
establishment of economic, social and political
democracy in the colonies. Being an awakened
class, the middle class was full of excessive
discontent and frustration. England had been
following mercantilism, an ideology which had
emerged in the economic field since the later half
of the 16th century. When the colonies grew in
size and importance, the British government felt
keen on establishing control over them. Firstly,
Britain appointed governors to rule them and
the salary was to be borne by the colonial
exchequer. Secondly, the British merchants were
interested in deriving benefits from a policy which
Britain was to adopt arbitrarily and implement
it in her colonies in America. This policy was
called mercantilist policy. Under the mercantilism
policies, England imposed many restrictions on
production in American colonies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>World History - American Revolution-2</i></strong></div>

The colonists were made to sell their goods
only to the English Merchants and to buy foreign
goods after paying duty at an English port.
Furthermore, the colonists were not to compete
with the English manufacturers. Opposition to
these mercantilist regulations were widespread
and some of the merchants in the colonies
maintained their trade contacts with the enemies
of Britain.
<br>
<br>
While a new spirit was developing in
America, the British still stuck to the old
mercantilist theory. They also did not recognise
that the power of the British Parliament could
be subjected to limitations. Further they did not
share the Ameri-can restrictions by some kind of
fundamental law.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Seven Years War (1756-63)</b> gave Great
Britain a much larger American empire. It also
placed her under a heavy war debt. The long
war strained her resources to such an extent that
her government started imposing heavy duties
on the manufactured goods. Since experience
during the war had shown that the colonies were
very reluctant to cooperate with each other for
mutual protection and to pay any additional
taxes, it seemed necessary for the British
government to resort to compulsion. The
successive British government since 1763 were
of the view that they were not acting illegally by
imposing additional taxes. But they were seeking
to hold the colonies in their traditional position
of subordination just at the time when the most
vigorous elements in the colonial population were
beginning to feel that they were entitled to
equality. In view of the fundamental differences
between the British and American conception of
the nature of the empire and powers of British
Parliament, it appeared unlikely that conflicts
could be avoided permanently.
<br>
<br>
When the French lost Canada to Britain after
Seven Years War, the colonies no larger feared
of a French attack. It was this situation which
gave the colonist courage and self-confidence.
But the British government under King GeorgeIII, was not prepared to give them a large
measure of independence. King George-III forced
the cabinet to secure parliamentary sanction for
imposing new taxes on the colonists. The royal
officials in the colonies were ordered to enforce
the mercantilist trade regulations. It gave customs
officials writs of assistance or general search
warrants empowering them to search ships and
warehouses for smuggled goods. This aroused
stout opposition. It was argued that the writs of
assistance violated the fundamental rights of
citizens and were therefore illegal. This argument
reflected the American conviction that the powers
of the British government were limited by
fundamental laws.
<br>
<br>
The British government by means of a Royal
Proclamation made in 1763, ordered settlers not
to move beyond the traditional border on the
western side lest they provoke the Red Indians.
It stopped the colonists from marching towards
the West and they considered the British
government to be their enemy.
In 1763, the British government decided to
maintain an army in North America in order to
guard against possible Red Indian raids and
French attempts at reconquest. The British
government led by George Greenville felt that
since it was needed for the defence of the
colonies, a part of the cost should be borne by
the colonies.
<br>
<br>
Greenville proposed four regulations which
affected the colonies. Two important regulations
were Sugar Act (Molasses Act 1764) and Stamp
Act (1765). The other two were Currency Act
and Quartering Act.
Through the Sugar Act, duty was imposed
on molasses imported by the colonists. Customs
officials were ordered to show more energy and
strictness in collecting duties. British ships were
instructed to seize smugglers and an admiralty
court was set up to try smuggling cases. Duties
were also imposed upon some other colonial
imports. It was to compel the colonists to
contribute towards meeting the expenses of
British troops stationed in the colonies. This was
followed by the Stamp Act.
The Stamp Act declared that stamp duties
were to be paid on newspapers and legal
commercial documents. This was the first time
that the British government had levied a direct
tax on the colonies. The American felt that the
Stamp Act would drain the colonies of money
and make their debts to the British merchants
more intolerable. They believed that taxation
without representation was tyranny. They
accepted trade regulations by the British
Parliament as legitimate, but felt that British
Parliament's imposition of direct taxes was
contrary to fundamental law and natural rights.
The opposition took the form not only of
resolutions by colonial assemblies and of a
collective protest drafted by a Congress of
delegates from nine colonies, but also of violent
popular demonstrations. The colonists also
devised the instrument of general agreement to
stop importing British goods. British merchants
suffered heavy losses and urged the British
government to give way. By this time Greenville
was succeeded by Marquess of Rockingham.
Rockingham repealed the Stamp Act, lowered
the molasses duty and passed a Declaratory Act,
which affirmed the principle of the supremacy
of the British parliament over the colonies.
Rockingham was replaced by William Pitt
and, Townshend became the Finance Minister.
He levied customs duties on five goods (Tea, lead,
paper, coin-metal and paints) which were
imported by America from England. He explained
that by levying import duties which were in the
nature of indirect taxes, he was only complying
with the viewpoint of the colonists. John
Dickinson, a conservative Rennsylvanian lawyer,
while accepting the right of British Parliament to
regulate trade, denied that it could levy taxes,
direct or indirect.
<br>
<br>
Riots against the British law broke out at
several places. Besides raising a storm of protest
the merchants of Boston, Philadelphia and
New York resorted to the boycott of the British
goods. The condition in Boston city was very
deplorable. The regiment of British regulars
stationed in Boston to prevent smuggling fired
their guns on a protesting mob, in which four or
five persons were killed. This came to be known
as Boston massacre.
The new taxes could not be collected. The
British traders were overwhelmed with fear and
on their insistence Lord North, who took place
of Townshend after his death, repealed all duties,
except on tea.
After these successful agitations it was quite
clear to popular leaders like Sam Adams who
led Boston Mob, that none of the basis issues
had been settled. In 1772 Adams set up
throughout Massachusetts a network of
committees of correspondence to organise
resistance to British authority. This idea was
copied by Jefferson in Virginia and by similar
leaders in other colonies. As a result a real intercolonial political organisation began to take place.
The British government made yet another
mistake in 1773 which proved to be very costly.
In 1773, Parliament passed the Tea Act, granting
the financially troubled British East India
Company an exclusive monopoly on tea exported
to the American colonies. This Act agitated
colonists even further: although the new
monopoly meant cheaper tea, many Americans
the believed that Britain was trying to dupe them
into accepting the hated tax.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Boston Tea Party:</i></strong></div>

In response to the unpopular Act, tea agents
in many American cities resigned or cancelled
orders, and merchants refused consignments. In
Boston, however, Governor Thomas Hutchinson
resolved to uphold the law and ordered that three
ships arriving in Boston Harbour be allowed to
deposit their cargoes and that appropriate
payment be made for the goods. This policy
prompted about sixty men, including some
members of the Sons of Liberty, to board the
ships on the night (disguised as Native
Americans) and dump the tea chests into the
water. The event became known as the Boston
Tea Party.
<br>
<br>
The dumping of the tea in the harbour was
the most destructive act that the colonists had
taken against Britain thus far. The previous
rioting and looting of British officials’ houses over
the Stamp Act had been minor compared to the
thousands of pounds in damages to the ships
and tea. Governor Hutchinson, angered by the
colonists’ disregard for authority and disrespect
for property, left for England. The “tea party”
was a bold and daring step forward on the road
to outright revolution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Intolerable Acts</i></strong></div>

The Tea Party had mixed results: some
Americans hailed the Bostonians as heroes, while
others condemned them as radicals. Parliament,
very displeased, passed the Coercive Acts in 1774
in a punitive effort to restore order. Colonists
quickly renamed these Acts the Intolerable Acts.
Numbered among these Intolerable Acts was
the Boston Port Bill, which closed Boston Harbour
to all ships until Bostonians had repaid the British
East India Company for damages. The Acts also
restricted public assemblies and suspended many
civil liberties. Strict new provisions were also made
for housing British troops in American homes,
reviving the indignation created by the earlier
Quartering Act, which had been allowed to
expire in 1770.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Quebec Act:</i></strong></div>

At the same time the Coercive Acts were put
into effect, Parliament also passed the Quebec
Act. This Act granted more freedoms to Canadian
Catholics and extended Quebec’s territorial claims
to meet the western frontier of the American
colonies.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The First Continental Congress:</i></strong></div>

In response to the Intolerable Acts, delegates
from twelve of the thirteen colonies (Georgia
chose not to attend) met at the First Continental
Congress in Philadelphia in the autumn of 1774
to discuss a course of action. The delegates were
all fairly prominent men in colonial political life
but held different philosophical beliefs. Samuel
Adams, John Adams, Patrick Henry, and George
Washington were among the more famous men
who attended. Although rebellion against the
Crown was at this point still far from certain,
leaders believed grievances had to be redressed
to Parliament and King George III. The delegates
met for nearly two months and concluded with
a written Declaration of Rights and requests to
Parliament, George III, and the British people to
repeal the Coercive Acts so that harmony could
be restored. The First Continental Congress
marked an important turning point in colonial
relations with Britain. Although some delegates
still hoped for reconciliation, the decisions they
made laid the foundations for a revolt. Even
though American colonial leaders had petitioned
Parliament and King George III to repeal taxes
in the past, never had they boldly denounced
them until this point, when they claimed that
Britain’s actions had violated their natural rights
and the principles of the English Constitution.
This appeal to natural rights above the King or
God was groundbreaking because it justified and
even legalized colonial opposition to the Crown.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Battle of Lexington and Concord:</i></strong></div>

By 1775, colonial resentment toward Britain
had become a desire for rebellion. Many cities
and towns organized volunteer militias of
“minutemen”-named for their alleged ability to
prepare for combat at the drop of a hat-who
began to drill openly in public common areas.
On April 19, 1775, a British Commander
dispatched troops to seize an arsenal of colonial
militia weapons stored in Concord,
Massachusetts. Militiamen from nearby
Lexington intercepted them and opened fire.
Eight Americans died as the British sliced through
them and moved on to Concord. The British
arrived in Concord only to be ambushed by the
Concord militia. The “shot heard round the
world”—or the first shot of many that defeated
the British troops at Concord-sent a ripple
throughout the colonies, Europe, and the rest of
the world. The British retreated to Boston after
more than 270 soldiers in their unit were killed,
compared to fewer than 100 Americans. The
conflict became known as the Battle of Lexington
and Concord. The minutemen’s victory
encouraged patriots to redouble their efforts and
at the same time convinced King George III to
commit military forces to crushing the rebellion.
Almost immediately, thousands of colonialists set
up camp around Boston, laying siege to the
British position. The battle initiated a chain of
events, starting with the militia siege of Boston
and the Second Continental Congress, that kicked
the Revolutionary War into high gear.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Second Continental Congress:</i></strong></div>

The Second Continental Congress was
convened a few weeks after the Battle of
Lexington and Concord to decide just how to
handle the situation. Delegates from all thirteen
colonies gathered once again in Philadelphia and
discussed options. The desire to avoid a war was
still strong, and in July 1775, delegate John
Dickinson from Pennsylvania penned the Olive
Branch Petition to be sent to Britain. All the
delegates signed the petition, which professed
loyalty to King George III and beseeched him to
call off the troops in Boston so that peace
between the colonies and Britain could be
restored. George III eventually rejected the
petition.
<br>
<br>
Despite their issuance of the Olive Branch
Petition, the delegates nevertheless believed that
the colonies should be put in a state of defence
against any future possible British action. After
much debate, they also selected George
Washington to command the American army
surrounding Boston, renaming it the Continental
Army. Washington was a highly respected
Virginian plantation owner, and his leadership
would further unite the northern and southern
colonies in the Revolution.
The delegates’ hopes for acknowledgment and
reconciliation failed in June 1775, when the Battle
of Bunker Hill was fought outside Boston.
Although the British ultimately emerged
victorious, they suffered over 1,000 casualties,
prompting British officials to take the colonial
unrest far more seriously than they had
previously. The engagement led King George
III to declare officially that the colonies were in
a state of rebellion. Any hope of reconciliation
and a return to the pre-1763 status quo had
vanished.
<br>
<br>
On July 4, 1776, America severed its relations
with England and the representatives who
gathered in Philadelphia declared independence
of the 13 colonies and approved the Declaration
of Independence. The main purpose of the
Declaration of Independence was to reveal the
fact that the public is empowered to change a
government that deprives it of their natural
rights. It was emphasized in the Declaration of
Independence that public is the source of power
and was fully empowered to elect the government
of its choice. It was also stated that hence forward
the Americans were free to take authoritative
decisions independently in all the matters of war,
peace, truce and business which are the rights of
an independent state.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Battle of Saratoga:</i></strong></div>

After numerous battles, the turning point in
the war came in 1777 at the Battle of Saratoga
in upstate New York. When American forces
won, their victory encouraged France to pledge
its support for the United States in the FrancoAmerican Alliance of 1778. A year later, Spain
followed suit and also entered the war against
Britain. Spain, hoping to see Britain driven out
of North America, had tacitly supported the
Americans by providing them with munitions
and supplies since the beginning of the war. Their
entry as combatants took pressure off the
Americans, as Britain was forced to divert troops
to fight the Spanish elsewhere. Finally, Holland
entered the war against Britain in 1780. Though
the war went on for several years, American
popular support for it, especially after France
and Spain entered the fray, remained high. The
motivation for rebellion remained strong at all
levels of society, not merely among American
military and political leaders. French and Spanish
assistance certainly helped the Americans, but
without the grassroots support of average
Americans, the rebellion would have quickly
collapsed.
<br>
<br>
Fortified by the Franco-American Alliance,
the Americans maintained an impasse with
the British until 1781, when the Americans laid
siege to a large encampment of British forces
under Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia.
Scattered battles persisted until 1783, but the
British, weary of the stalemate, decided to
negotiate peace.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Peace of Paris:</i></strong></div>

The war came to an official close in September
1783, when Britain, the United States, France,
and Spain negotiated the Peace of Paris. The
treaty granted vast tracts of western lands to the
Americans and recognized the United States as
a new and independent country. The last British
forces departed New York in November 1783,
leaving the American government in full control
of the new nation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Constitution of America:</i></strong></div>

To address the problems with the Articles of
Confederation, delegates from five states met at
the Annapolis Convention in Maryland in 1786.
However, they could not agree on how these
issues should be resolved. Finally, a new
convention was proposed for the following year
with the express purpose of revising the Articles
of Confederation.
In 1787, delegates from twelve of the thirteen
states (minus Rhode Island) met at the
Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia. Most
of the attendees were not die-hard revolutionaries
(Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, Samuel Adams,
and Patrick Henry were all absent). Nevertheless,
most did have experience writing their own State
Constitutions. Though all fifty-five delegates
involved in the proceedings were wealthy
property owners, most were aware that they
were serving a republic that comprised all social
classes. George Washington was unanimously
chosen as the Chairman of the convention.
It quickly became clear to the Philadelphia
delegates that the Articles should be scrapped
and replaced with an entirely new constitution
to create a stronger national government. Though
this about-face was a violation of Congress’s
mandate to revise the Articles only, most
delegates believed there was no other way to
restore order in the Union.
<br>
<br>
The delegates began drafting a new
Constitution to create a republican government.
They decided on a government consisting of three
branches: Legislative (Congress), Executive (the
President), and Judicial (headed by the Supreme
Court). Delegates believed this separation of
powers into three different branches would
ensure that the United States would not become
another monarchy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Virginia and New Jersey Plans:</i></strong></div>

The structure of the new legislative branch
was the subject of a heated debate, as delegates
from Virginia and New Jersey both submitted
proposals. The Virginia Plan called for a bicameral
(two-house) legislature in which the number
of representatives each state had would depend
on the state’s population. The larger, more
populous states supported this proposal because
it would give them more power. Hence, the
Virginia plan came to be known as the “large
state plan.”
<br>
<br>
The New Jersey Plan proposed a unicameral
(one-house) legislature in which all states had
the same number of representatives regardless of
population. This “small state plan” was, not
surprisingly, the favourite of smaller states, which
stood to gain power from it.
Eventually, the delegates settled on what
came to be called the Great Compromise: a new
Congress with two houses—an upper Senate, in
which each state would be represented by two
senators, and a lower House of Representatives,
in which the number of delegates would be
apportioned based on state population. Senators
would be appointed by state legislatures every
six years; representatives in the House would be
elected directly by the people every two years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The President:</i></strong></div>

The delegates had an easier time outlining
presidential powers. Although some delegates
had extreme opinions—Alexander Hamilton
proposed a constitutional monarchy headed by
an American King—most agreed that a new
executive or president was needed to give the
country a strong leadership that it had lacked
under the Articles.
Article II of the Constitution thus outlined
the powers of a new executive outside the control
of Congress. The president would be elected via
the Electoral College for a term of four years,
would be commander-in-chief of the U.S.
military, could appoint judges, and could veto
legislation passed by Congress.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Judiciary:</i></strong></div>

The judiciary branch of the new government
would be headed by a Supreme Court, which
would be headed by a chief justice. The structure
of the rest of the federal court system, however,
was not formalized until the Judiciary Act of
1789.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Checks and Balances:</i></strong></div>

Many delegates felt that separation of powers
was not enough to prevent one branch of
government from dominating, so they also
created a system of checks and balances to
balance power even further. Under this system,
each branch of government had the ability to
check the powers of the others.
The President, for example, was given the
power to appoint Supreme Court justices, cabinet
members, and foreign ambassadors—but only
with the approval of the Senate. On the other
hand, the president was granted the right to veto
all Congressional legislation.
Congress was given its own veto power over
the president—a two-thirds majority vote could
override any presidential veto. Congress also
was charged with the responsibility to
confirm presidential appointees—but also the
power to block them. And finally, Congress
had the ability to impeach and remove the
president for treason, bribery, and other “high
crimes and misdemeanors.” The Supreme Court
was given the sweeping power of judicial
review—the authority to declare an act of
Congress unconstitutional and thereby strike it
down.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fear of Pure Democracy:</i></strong></div>

The delegates also feared pure democracy and
considered it to be the placement of the
government directly in the hands of the “rabble.”
Many elements of the Constitution were thus
engineered to ensure that only the “best men”
would run the country.
Under the original Constitution, senators
were to be appointed by state legislatures or
governors, not elected by the people—in fact,
this rule did not change until the Seventeenth
Amendment (1913) established direct elections
for senators. Although representatives in the
House were elected directly by the people, their
terms were set at only two years, compared to
senators’ six years. In addition, even though new
legislation could be introduced only in the House,
the Senate had to approve and ratify any Bills
before they could become law.
<br>
<br>
These checks on pure democracy were not
confined to the legislative branch. The Electoral
College was implemented to ensure that the
uneducated masses didn’t elect someone “unfit”
for the presidency. Life terms for Supreme Court
justices were also instituted as a safeguard against mob rule.
