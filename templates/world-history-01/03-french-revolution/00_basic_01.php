<h3>French Revolution</h3>



The French Revolution broke out in 1789 as
a result of the interaction of varied factors
political, economic, social and intellectual. One
among the political factors leading to the
Revolution was the absolution of the king. All
administrative functions were centralized in the
hands of the king who was not answerable to
anyone except God. The king’s word was the
law of the land. At one time absolutism was
quite popular in France as it had helped the
nation to become supreme in Europe besides
promoting the well-being of the people. Louis
XV, who became king in 1715, was neither great
nor enlightened. He wasted his time and energy
in pursuit of idle personal pleasures and allowed
the administration to be conducted by the
mistresses. His successor Louis XVI, who
happened to rule France on the eve of the
Revolution, though well-meaning, kind and just,
lacked the very qualities which could have saved
the country from the prevailing situation. Years
of feudal oppression and fiscal mismanagement
contributed to a French society that was ripe for
revolt.
<br>
<br>
Causes of The Revolution:
The following reasons are commonly adduced:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the increasingly prosperous elite of wealthy
commoners—merchants, manufacturers, and
professionals, often called the bourgeoisie—
produced by the 18th century’s economic growth
resented its exclusion from political power and
positions of honour;</li>
        <li>the peasants were acutely
aware of their situation and were less and less
willing to support the anachronistic and
burdensome feudal system;</li>
        <li>the philosophers,
who advocated social and political reform, had
been read more widely in France than anywhere
else;</li>
        <li>French participation in the American
Revolution had driven the government to the
brink of bankruptcy.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

Long years of war had drained the financial
resources of France. A number of ill-advised
financial manoeuvres in the late 1700s worsened
the financial situation of the already cashstrapped French government. France’s prolonged
involvement in the Seven Years’ War of 1756–
1763 drained the treasury, as did the country’s
participation in the American Revolution of 1775–
1783. . Under Louis XVI, France helped the
thirteen American colonies to gain their
independence from the common enemy, Britain.
Aggravating the situation was the fact that the
government had a sizable army and navy to
maintain, which was an expenditure of
particular importance during those volatile times.
Moreover, in the typical indulgent fashion that
so irked the common folk, mammoth costs
associated with the upkeep of King Louis XVI’s
extravagant palace at Versailles and the frivolous
spending of the queen, Marie-Antoinette, did little
to relieve the growing debt. These decades of
fiscal irresponsibility were one of the primary
factors that led to the French Revolution Leaders
who gave the state credit, now began to charge
10 per cent interest on loans. So the French
government was obliged to spend an increasing
percentage of its budget on interest payments
alone. To meet its regular expenses, such as the
cost of maintaining an army, the court, running
government offices or universities, the state was
forced to increase taxes. Yet even this measure
would not have sufficed. French society in the
eighteenth century was divided into three estates,
and only members of the third estate paid taxes.
The society of estates was part of the feudal
system that dated back to the middle ages. The
term Old Regime is usually used to describe the
society and institutions of France before
1789.Peasants made up about 90 per cent of the
population. However, only a small number of
them owned the land they cultivated. About 60
per cent of the land was owned by nobles, the
Church and other richer members of the third
estate. The members of the first two estates, that
is, the clergy and the nobility, enjoyed certain
privileges by birth. The most important of these
was exemption from paying taxes to the state.
The nobles further enjoyed feudal privileges. These
included feudal dues, which they extracted from
the peasants. Peasants were obliged to render
services to the lord, to work in his house and
fields, to serve in the army or to participate in
building roads. The Church too extracted its share
of taxes called tithes from the peasants, and
finally, all members of the third estate had to
pay taxes to the state. These included a direct
tax, called taille, and a number of indirect taxes
which were levied on articles of everyday
consumption like salt or tobacco. The burden of
financing activities of the state through taxes was
borne by the third estate alone.
Noting a downward economic spiral in the
late 1700s, King Louis XVI brought in a number
of financial advisors to review the weakened
French treasury. Each advisor reached the same
conclusion—that France needed a radical change
in the way it taxed the public—and each advisor
was, in turn, kicked out. Finally, in the early
1780s, France realized that it had to address the
problem, and fast. First, Louis XVI appointed
Charles de Calonne, Controller General of
finances in 1783. Then, in 1786, the French
government, worried about unrest should it to
try to raise taxes on the peasants, yet reluctant
to ask the nobles for money, approached various
European banks in search of a loan. By that point,
however, most of Europe knew the depth of
France’s financial woes, so the country found
itself with no credibility. Calonne finally
convinced Louis XVI to gather the nobility
together for a conference, during which Calonne
and the king could fully explain the tenuous
situation facing France. This gathering, dubbed
the Assembly of Notables, turned out to be a
virtual who’s who of people who didn’t want to
pay any taxes. After giving his presentation,
Calonne urged the notables either to agree to the
new taxes or to forfeit their exemption to the
current ones. Unsurprisingly, the notables refused
both plans and turned against Calonne,
questioning the validity of his work. He was
dismissed shortly thereafter, leaving France’s
economic prospects even grimmer than before.
The eighteenth century witnessed the
emergence of social groups, termed the middle
class, who earned their wealth through an
expanding overseas trade and from the
manufacture of goods such as woollen and silk
textiles that were either exported or bought by
the richer members of society. In addition to
merchants and manufacturers, the third estate
included professions such as lawyers or
administrative officials. Although many accounts
of the French Revolution focus on the French
peasantry’s grievances—rising food prices,
disadvantageous feudal contracts, and general
mistreatment at the hands of the aristocracy—
these factors actually played a limited role in
inciting the Revolution. For all of the hardships
that they endured, it wasn’t the peasants who
jump-started the Revolution. Rather, it was the
wealthy commoners—the bourgeoisie—who
objected most vocally to the subpar treatment
they were receiving. The bourgeoisie were
generally hardworking, educated men who were
well versed in the enlightened thought of the
time. Although many of the wealthier members
of the bourgeoisie had more money than some of
the French nobles, they lacked elite titles and
thus were subjected to the same treatment and
taxation as even the poorest peasants. It was the
bourgeoisie that would really act as a catalyst
for the Revolution, and once they started to act,
the peasants were soon to follow. All of these
were educated and believed that no group in
society should be privileged by birth. Rather, a
person’s social position must depend on his merit.
These ideas envisaging a society based on
freedom and equal laws and opportunities for
all, were put forward by philosophers such as
John Locke and Jean Jacques Rousseau. In his
Two Treatises of Government, Locke sought to
refute the doctrine of the divine and absolute
right of the monarch. In The Spirit of the Laws,
Montesquieu proposed a division of power within
the government between the legislative, the
executive and the judiciary. This model of
government was put into force in the USA, after
the thirteen colonies declared their independence
from Britain. The American constitution and its
guarantee of individual rights was an important
example for political thinkers in France. Another
great writer was Voltaire, who employed his
sharp tongue and sarcastic pen in a tirade against
the existing order in general and against
Christianity in particular. His writings became
the gospel of the French Revolution. In his
writings he advocated “enlightened despotism”
and created a thundering sensation throughout
France.
<br>
<br>
The most prominent among the French
philosophers was Rousseau. In his “Social
Contract” which became the Bible of the French
Revolution he says, “Man is born free but he is
everywhere in chains”. He denounced the
existing government as illegitimate and
promulgated the theory of popular sovereignty
and popularized the notion of liberty, equality
and fraternity. Rousseau carried the idea
forward, proposing a form of government based
on a social contract between people and their
representatives. Montesquieu had only
denounced the autocracy of the crown, while
Voltaire had vehemently criticized the clergy and
exposed the social evils. But Rousseau did
something constructive for the regeneration of
the society. His “Social Contract” also instilled
in the people a strong desire to raise the banner
of the revolt against the established monarchy.
The Influence of the American War of
Independence on France: When the people of
America rose in revolt against the English rule
and fought the War of Independence, it was
France which rushed to the help of the Americans
with men and money. It resulted in a great blow
to the finances of France. Though France became
bankrupt, the French people became rich in their
thoughts and were convinced that the
melancholic state of affairs of the France could
be made good by a revolution. The success of a
revolution and the American War of
Independence opened their eyes and their
thoughts and actions found a happy blend there.
According to Webster, “The War of American
Independence became an eye-opener for the
nations of Europe and in particular gave leaders
to the French Revolution”.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COURSE OF THE REVOLUTION:</i></strong></div>

<b>The Estates-General, 1789:</b> In the wake of
Calonne’s dismissal, Louis XVI brought back
Swiss banker Jacques Necker, who had
previously served a ten-year stint as Director
General of Finance. After assessing the situation,
Necker insisted that Louis XVI call together the
Estates-General, a French congress that originated
in the medieval period and consisted of three
estates. The First Estate was the clergy, the Second
Estate the nobility, and the Third Estate effectively
the rest of French society.
<br>
<br>
On May 5, 1789, Louis XVI convened the
Estates-General. Almost immediately, it became
apparent that this archaic arrangement—the
group had last been assembled in 1614—would
not sit well with its present members. Although
Louis XVI granted the Third Estate greater
numerical representation, the Parliament of Paris
stepped in and invoked an old rule mandating
that each estate receive one vote, regardless of
size. As a result, though the Third Estate was
vastly larger than the clergy and nobility, each
estate had the same representation—one vote.
Inevitably, the Third Estate’s vote was to be
overridden by the combined votes of the clergy
and nobility. The members of the third estate
demanded that voting now be conducted by the
assembly as a whole, where each member would
have one vote. This was one of the democratic
principles put forward by philosophers like
Rousseau in his book 'The Social Contract'. When
the king rejected this proposal, members of the
third estate walked out of the assembly in protest.
The fact that the Estates-General hadn’t been
summoned in nearly 200 years probably says a
thing or two about its effectiveness. The First
and Second Estates—clergy and nobility,
respectively—were too closely related in many
matters. Both were linked intrinsically to the
royalty and shared many similar privileges. As a
result, their votes often went the same way,
automatically neutralizing any effort by the Third
Estate.
<br>
<br>
Additionally, in a country as secularized as
France at the time, giving the church a full third
of the vote was ill-advised: although France’s
citizens would ultimately have their revenge, at
the time the church’s voting power just fostered
more animosity. There were numerous
philosophers in France speaking out against
religion and the mindless following that it
supposedly demanded, and many resented being
forced to follow the decisions of the church on a
national scale.
Although the reconvening of the EstatesGeneral presented France’s aristocracy and clergy
with a perfect opportunity to appease the Third
Estate and maintain control, they focused only
on maintaining the dominance of their respective
estates rather than address the important issues
that plagued the country. When the EstatesGeneral convened, the Third Estate wasn’t
seeking a revolution—just a bit of liberty and a
more equitable tax burden. The entire Revolution
might have been avoided had the first two estates
simply acquiesced to some of the Third Estate’s
moderate proposals. Instead, they fell back on
tradition and their posh lifestyles and lit the
revolutionary flame.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Tennis Court Oath:</i></strong></div>

Three days after splitting from the EstatesGeneral, the delegates from the Third Estate (now
the National Assembly) found themselves locked
out of the usual meeting hall and convened on
a nearby tennis court instead. There, all but one
of the members took the Tennis Court Oath,
which stated simply that the group would remain
indissoluble until it had succeeded in creating a
new national constitution.
Upon hearing of the National Assembly’s
formation, King Louis XVI held a general
gathering in which the government attempted
to intimidate the Third Estate into submission.
The assembly, however, had grown too strong,
and the king was forced to recognize the group.
Parisians had received word of the upheaval,
and revolutionary energy coursed through the
city. Inspired by the National Assembly,
commoners rioted in protest of rising prices.
Fearing violence, the king had troops surround
his palace at Versailles.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Bastille:</i></strong></div>

Blaming him for the failure of the EstatesGeneral, Louis XVI once again dismissed Director
General of Finance Jacques Necker. Necker was
a very popular figure, and when word of the
dismissal reached the public, hostilities spiked
yet again. In light of the rising tension, a scramble
for arms broke out, and on July 13, 1789,
revolutionaries raided the Paris town hall in
pursuit of arms. The next day, upon realizing
that it contained a large armoury, citizens on
the side of the National Assembly stormed the
Bastille, a medieval fortress and prison in Paris.
Although the weapons were useful, the
storming of the Bastille was more symbolic than
it was necessary for the revolutionary cause. The
revolutionaries faced little immediate threat and
had such intimidating numbers that they were
capable of non-violent coercion. By storming one
of Paris’s most notorious state prisons and
hoarding weapons, however, the revolutionaries
gained a symbolic victory over the Old Regime
and conveyed the message that they were not to
be trifled with.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Lafayette and the National Guard:</i></strong></div>

As the assembly secured control over the
capital, it seemed as if peace might still prevail:
the previous governmental council was exiled,
and Necker was reinstated. Assembly members
assumed top government positions in Paris, and
even the king himself traveled to Paris in
revolutionary garb to voice his support. To bolster
the defence of the assembly, the Marquis de
Lafayette, a noble, assembled a collection of
citizens into the French National Guard. Although
some blood had already been shed, the
Revolution seemed to be subsiding and safely in
the hands of the people. Though few deaths
among the nobility were reported, the National
Assembly, which was meeting in Versailles at
the time, feared that the raging rural peasants
would destroy all that the assembly had worked
hard to attain. In an effort to quell the
destruction, the assembly issued the August
Decrees, which nullified many of the feudal
obligations that the peasants had to their
landlords. For the time being, the countryside
calmed down.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Declaration of the Rights of Man and
of the Citizen:</i></strong></div>

Just three weeks later, on August 26, 1789,
the assembly issued the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and of the Citizen, a document that
guaranteed due process in judicial matters and
established sovereignty among the French people.
Influenced by the thoughts of the era’s greatest
minds, the themes found in the declaration made
one thing resoundingly clear: every person was
a Frenchman—and equal. Not surprisingly, the
French people embraced the declaration, while
the king and many nobles did not. It effectively
ended the ancient régime and ensured equality
for the bourgeoisie. Although subsequent French
constitutions that the Revolution produced would
be overturned and generally ignored, the themes
of the Declaration of Rights of Man and of the
Citizen would remain with the French citizenry
in perpetuity. The document The Declaration of
the Rights of Man and the Citizen stated that:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Men are born and remain free and equal
in rights.</li>
        <li>The aim of every political association is the
preservation of the natural and inalienable
rights of man; these are liberty, property,
security and resistance to oppression.</li>
        <li>The source of all sovereignty resides in the
nation; no group or individual may exercise
authority that does not come from the
people.</li>
        <li>Liberty consists of the power to do
whatever is not injurious to others.</li>
        <li>The law has the right to forbid only actions
that are injurious to society.</li>
        <li>Law is the expression of the general will.
All citizens have the right to participate
in its formation, personally or through
their representatives. All citizens are
equal before it.</li>
        <li>No man may be accused, arrested or
detained, except in cases determined by
the law.</li>
        <li>Every citizen may speak, write and print
freely; he must take responsibility for the
abuse of such liberty in cases determined
by the law.</li>
        <li>For the maintenance of the public force
and for the expenses of administration a
common tax is indispensable; it must be
assessed equally on all citizens in
proportion to their means.</li>
        <li>Since property is a sacred and inviolable
right, no one may be deprived of it, unless
a legally established public necessity
requires it. In that case a just compensation
must be given in advance.</li>
    </ul>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Food Crisis:</i></strong></div>

Despite the assembly’s gains, little had been
done to solve the growing food crisis in France.
Shouldering the burden of feeding their families,
it was the French women who took up arms on
October 5, 1789. They first stormed the city hall
in Paris, amassing a sizable army and gathering
arms. Numbering several thousands, the mob
marched to Versailles, followed by the National
Guard, which accompanied the women to
protect them. Overwhelmed by the mob, King
Louis XVI, effectively forced to take responsibility
for the situation, immediately sanctioned the
August Decrees and the Declaration of the Rights
of Man and of the Citizen. The next day, having
little choice, the royal family accompanied the
crowd back to Paris. To ensure that he was aware
of the woes of the city and its citizens, the king
and his family were “imprisoned” in the Tuileries
Palace in the city.
<br>
<br>
Though they focused on the king as
figurehead, most of the revolutionaries were more
against the nobles than the king. Everyday people
in France had limited interaction with royalty
and instead placed blame for the country’s
problems on the shoulders of local nobility. A
common phrase in France at the time was,
“If only the king knew,” as though he were
ignorant of the woes of the people. It was partly
owing to this perspective that the assembly
attempted to establish a constitutional monarchy
alongside the king, rather than simply oust him
and rule the nation itself.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Assembly’s Tenuous Control:</i></strong></div>

Despite the National Assembly’s progress,
weaknesses were already being exposed within
France, and the Great Fear and the women’s
march on Versailles demonstrated that perhaps
the assembly didn’t have as much control as it
liked to think. The revolution that the assembly
was overseeing in Paris was run almost
exclusively by the bourgeoisie, who were far more
educated and intelligent than the citizens out in
the country. Although the August Decrees helped
assuage the peasant’s anger, their dissatisfaction
would become a recurring problem. The differing
priorities that were already apparent
foreshadowed future rifts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Louis XVI’s Flight:</i></strong></div>

Although King Louis XVI maintained a
supportive front towards the Revolution, he
remained in contact with the rulers of Austria,
Prussia, and Sweden, asking for their help in
restoring his family to power. In late June 1791,
Louis XVI and his family attempted to escape to
the Austrian border, where they were supposed
to meet the Austrian army and arrange an attack
on the revolutionaries. However, the runaway
party was caught just before reaching the border
and brought back to Tuileries in Paris.
This escape attempt considerably weakened
the king’s position and lowered his regard in the
eyes of the French people. Beforehand, although
he had little real power remaining, he at least
still had the faith of his country. The king’s
attempt to run away, however, made it clear to
skeptics that he was a reluctant associate at best
and would turn his back on the constitution and
its system of limited monarchy at any moment.
The more radical revolutionaries, who had never
wanted a constitutional monarchy, trusted the
king even less after his attempted escape. The
more moderate revolutionaries, who once were
staunch proponents of the constitutional
monarchy, found themselves hard-pressed to
defend a situation in which a monarch was
abandoning his responsibilities. Therefore,
although Louis XVI constitutionally retained some
power after being returned to Paris, it was clear
that his days were numbered.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Declaration of Pillnitz:</i></strong></div>

In response to Louis XVI’s capture and forced
return to Paris, Prussia and Austria issued the
Declaration of Pillnitz on August 27, 1791,
warning the French against harming the king
and demanding that the monarchy be restored.
The declaration also implied that Prussia and
Austria would intervene militarily in France if
any harm came to the king.
Prussia and Austria’s initial concern was
simply for Louis XVI’s well-being, but soon the
countries began to worry that the French people’s
revolutionary sentiment would infect their own
citizens. The Declaration of Pillnitz was issued
to force the French Revolutionaries to think twice
about their actions and, if nothing else, make
them aware that other countries were watching
the Revolution closely.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Constitution of 1791:</i></strong></div>

In September 1791, the National Assembly
released its much-anticipated Constitution of
1791, which created a constitutional monarchy,
or limited monarchy, for France. This move
allowed King Louis XVI to maintain control of
the country, even though he and his ministers
would have to answer to new legislature, which
the new constitution dubbed the Legislative
Assembly. The constitution also succeeded in
eliminating the nobility as a legal order and
struck down monopolies and guilds. It
established a poll tax and barred servants from
voting, ensuring that control of the country
stayed firmly in the hands of the middle class.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Jacobins and Girondins:</i></strong></div>

Divisions quickly formed within the new
Legislative Assembly, which coalesced into two
main camps. On one side were the Jacobins, a
group of radical liberals—consisting mainly of
deputies, leading thinkers, and generally
progressive society members—who wanted to
drive the Revolution forward aggressively. The
Jacobins found Louis’s actions contemptible and
wanted to forgo the constitutional monarchy and
declare France a republic.
Disagreeing with the Jacobins’ opinions were
many of the more moderate members of the
Legislative Assembly, who deemed a
constitutional monarchy essential. The most
notable of these moderates was Jacques-Pierre
Brissot. His followers were thus labeled Brissotins,
although they became more commonly known
as Girondins.
 Meanwhile, in cities throughout France, a
group called the sans-culottes began to wield
significant and unpredictable influence. The
group’s name—literally, “without culottes,” the
knee breeches that the privileged wore—indicated
their disdain for the upper classes. The sansculottes consisted mainly of urban laborers,
peasants, and other French poor who disdained
the nobility and wanted to see an end to privilege.
Over the summer of 1792, the sans-culottes
became increasingly violent and difficult to
control.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>War against Austria and Prussia:</i></strong></div>

A number of French counter revolutionaries
nobles, ecclesiastics, and some bourgeois—
abandoned the struggle in their own country and
emigrated. Many formed armed groups close to
the northeastern frontier of France and sought
help from the rulers of Europe. The rulers were
at first indifferent to the Revolution but began to
worry when the National Constituent Assembly
proclaimed a revolutionary principle of
international law—namely, that a people had
the right of self-determination. In accordance
with this principle, the Papal territory of Avignon
was reunited with France on September 13, 1791.
By early 1792 both radicals, eager to spread the
principles of the Revolution, and the king, hopeful
that war would either strengthen his authority
or allow foreign armies to rescue him, supported
an aggressive policy. France declared war against
Austria on April 20, 1792.
In the first phase of the war (April–September
1792), France suffered defeats; Prussia joined the
war in July, and an Austro-Prussian army crossed
the frontier and advanced rapidly toward Paris.
<br>
<br>
Believing that they had been betrayed by the
king and the aristocrats, the Paris revolutionaries
rose on August 10, 1792, occupied Tuileries
Palace, where Louis XVI was living, and
imprisoned the royal family in the Temple. At
the beginning of September, the Parisian crowd
broke into the prisons and massacred the nobles
and clergy held there. Meanwhile, volunteers
were pouring into the army as the Revolution
had awakened French nationalism. In a final
effort the French forces checked the Prussians
on September 20, 1792, at Valmy. On the same
day, a new assembly, the National Convention,
met. The next day it proclaimed the abolition of
the monarchy and the establishment of the
republic.
In the second phase of the war (September
1792–April 1793), the revolutionaries got the
better of the enemy. Belgium, the Rhineland,
Savoy, and the county of Nice were occupied by
French armies. Meanwhile, the National
Convention was divided between the Girondins,
who wanted to organize a bourgeois republic in
France and to spread the Revolution over the
whole of Europe, and the Montagnards
(“Mountain Men”), who, with Robespierre,
wanted to give the lower classes a greater share
in political and economic power. Despite efforts
made by the Girondins, Louis XVI was judged
by the Convention, condemned to death for
treason, and executed on January 21, 1793; the
queen, Marie-Antoinette, was guillotined nine
months later.
In the weeks after the execution of the king,
the internal and external wars in France
continued to grow. Prussian and Austrian forces
pushed into the French countryside, and one
noted French general even defected to the
opposition. Unable to assemble an army out of
the disgruntled and protesting peasants, the
Girondin-led National Convention started to
panic. In an effort to restore peace and order,
the convention created the Committee of Public
Safety on April 6, 1793, to maintain order within
France and protect the country from external
threats.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Jacobin’s Coup:</i></strong></div>

The Committee of Public Safety followed a
moderate course after its creation but proved
weak and ineffective. After a few fruitless months
under the committee, the sans-culottes finally
reached their boiling point. They stormed the
National Convention and accused the Girondins
of representing the aristocracy. Seeing an
opportunity, Maximilien Robespierre, the leader
of the Jacobins, harnessed the fury of the sansculottes to take control of the convention, banish
the Girondins, and install the Jacobins in power.
Once again, the sans-culottes proved to be a
formidable force in effecting change during the
Revolution. Already upset about the composition
of the National Convention—which remained
dominated by middle- and upper-class
bourgeoisie and was influenced by big thinkers
of the time—they became even more angry upon
learning that many of the Girondin leaders
expected them to bolster the failing war effort.
Sieyes had originally rallied the Third Estate by
reminding them that they numbered many and
that their numbers gave them strength. This
message clearly stuck with the sans-culottes
throughout the Revolution, and they took
advantage of their strength at every possible
opportunity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Reign of Terror:</i></strong></div>

In the autumn of 1793, Robespierre and the
Jacobins focused on addressing economic and
political threats within France. What began as a
proactive approach to reclaiming the nation
quickly turned bloody as the government
instituted its infamous campaign against internal
opposition known as the Reign of Terror.
Beginning in September, Robespierre, under the
auspices of the Committee of Public Safety, began
pointing an accusing finger at anyone whose beliefs
seemed to be counter revolutionary citizens who
had committed no crime but merely had social or
political agendas that varied too much from
Robespierre’s. The committee targeted even those
who shared many Jacobin views but were perceived
as just slightly too radical or conservative. A rash
of executions ensued in Paris and soon spread to
smaller towns and rural areas.
During the nine-month period that followed,
anywhere from 15,000 to 50,000 French citizens
were beheaded at the guillotine. Even longtime
associates of Robespierre such as Georges Danton,
who had helped orchestrate the Jacobin rise to
power, fell victim to the paranoia. When Danton
wavered in his conviction, questioned
Robespierre’s increasingly rash actions, and tried
to arrange a truce between France and the
warring countries. Robespierre pursued his
policies so relentlessly that even his supporters
began to demand moderation. Finally, he was
convicted by a court in July 1794, arrested and
on the next day sent to the guillotine.
The Constitution of 1795 and the Directory:
The fall of the Jacobin government allowed
the wealthier middle classes to seize power.On
August 22, 1795, the convention was finally able
to ratify a new constitution, the Constitution of
1795, which ushered in a period of governmental
restructuring. The new legislature would consist
of two houses: an upper house, called the Council
of Ancients, consisting of 250 members, and a
lower house, called the Council of Five Hundred,
consisting of 500 members. Fearing influence from
the left, the convention decreed that two-thirds
of the members of the first new legislature had
to have already served on the National
Convention between 1792 and 1795.
The new constitution also stipulated that the
executive body of the new government would be
a group of five officers called the Directory.
Although the Directory would have no legislative
power, it would have the authority to appoint
people to fill the other positions within the
government, which was a source of considerable
power in itself. Annual elections would be held
to keep the new government in check.
The dilemma facing the new Directory was a
daunting one essentially, it had to rid the scene
of Jacobin influence while at the same time
prevent royalists from taking advantage of the
disarray and reclaiming the throne. The twothirds rule was implemented for this reason, as
an attempt to keep the same composition like
that of the original, moderate-run National
Convention. In theory, the new government
closely resembled that of the United States, with
its checks-and-balances system. As it turned out,
however, the new government’s priorities became
its downfall: rather than address the deteriorating
economic situation in the country, the legislature
instead focused on keeping progressive members
out. Ultimately, paranoia and attempts at
overprotection weakened the group.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the Committee of Public Safety’s
war effort was realizing unimaginable success.
French armies, especially those led by young
General Napoleon Bonaparte, were making
progress in nearly every direction. Napoleon’s
forces drove through Italy and reached as far as
Egypt before facing a deflating defeat. In the
face of this rout, and having received word of
political upheavals in France, Napoleon returned
to Paris. He arrived in time to lead a coup against
the Directory in 1799, eventually stepping up
and naming himself “first consul”—effectively,
the leader of France. With Napoleon at the helm,
the Revolution ended, and France entered a
fifteen-year period of military rule.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Significance of the French Revolution in
the World History:</i></strong></div>

French revolution influenced not only the
French public but left an indelible impression on
Europe and the entire world. Before and during
the revolution, certain ideas were put forward
which later became the foundation of modern
thought and practice. The first republic of France
lasted a few years only and may indicate that
the revolution was a fiasco. Although France
retrieved monarchy, it sustained good objectives
of the revolution. Feudal prerogatives could not
flourish again and the Church could not revive
its bygone glory. Government was run
efficaciously and the condition of farmers
improved considerably. Jurisdiction of the law
increased. Taxation was made more rational.
The French Revolution originated a new
concept in the matter of state, propagated new
ideology in respect of politics and society and
presented a fresh, novel outlook towards life. The
Revolution claimed that nationality did not mean
the subjection to one ruler but to a sharing of
same, blood, language and tradition. The idea of
nationalism had a profound effect on Europe
and, later on the world. Nearly every revolution
in the 19th and 20th century was caused by
nationalistic ambitions. It effect can be also seen
on the Indian struggle for independence. The
declaration of the Rights of Man, a statement of
the people’s rights issued by the French
revolutionary government in1789, laid down the
democratic principle that any government should
be “for the people” and “by the people”. It also
emphasized the principle of the popular
sovereignty, and that ultimately the people had
the right to create a government or to remove it
if it does not work for the welfare of the people.
The revolution acquainted the people with their
rights and they had come to know about their
individual freedom. The Revolution established
the principle that a country should be led by
men of ability and not necessarily by men of the
noble birth and this had enabled Napoleon to
rise from obscurity to the position of the Emperor
of France.
<br>
<br>
It can be said that French Revolution has
played a remarkable role in the making of the
modern age in Europe and other countries of the
world and familiarised the common people with
the spirit of liberty, equality and democracy. It
started a number of movements where people
demanded not only political freedom but also
right to property and freedom of expression. They
also demanded franchise. The revolution aroused
the spirit of political, social and economic equality.
Women claimed equal rights with men.
The Revolution awakened the spirit of
nationalism, which paved the way for the
unification of Italy and Germany. It also
popularized the concept of democracy. Absolute
monarchy was replaced by constitutional
monarchy in many countries. It fortified the
concept of fraternity and separated religion from
politics. It stood for secularism and condemned
religious fanaticism. The ideas of liberty and
democratic rights were the most important legacy
of the French Revolution. These spread from
France to the rest of Europe during the nineteenth
century, where feudal systems were abolished.
Colonial peoples reworked the idea of freedom
from bondage into their movements to create a
sovereign nation state. Tipu Sultan and Ram
Mohan Roy were greatly influenced from the
ideas coming from revolutionary France. The
impact of ideas of nationalism, democracy,
equality, etc., which arose from the French
Revolution can be seen on the Indian struggle
for independence and on Indian Constitution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Napoleon Era (1799-1815):</i></strong></div>

Napoleon was born in the island of Corsica
in 1769. His family had received French nobility
status when France made Corsica a province in
that year, and Napoleon was sent to France in
1777 to study at the Royal Military School in
Brienne. In 1784, Napoleon spent a year studying
at the Ecole Militaire in Paris, graduating as a
Second Lieutenant of artillery. Sent to Valence
on a peacetime mission, Napoleon whiled away
the hours there educating himself in history and
geography.
<br>
<br>
During the tumultuous years of the French
Revolution, Napoleon fought well for the
Republic, helping to defeat the British at Toulon.
For his services there, he was made a Brigadier
General. After the Directory came to power,
Napoleon married Josephine de Beauharnais and
gained command of the French army in Italy,
where, after defeating the Austrians in 1797, he
negotiated the Treaty of Campo Formio. This
victory boosted Napoleon to widespread
popularity when he returned to France. Eager to
get rid of this potential challenger, the Directory
agreed to let Napoleon take an army on an
Egyptian campaign to capture Egypt and hamper
British shipping to India. Napoleon's campaign
in Egypt did not go as planned, and when he
heard that the Directory was losing power, he
abandoned his army and rapidly returned to
Paris to take advantage of the situation, becoming
the first of three consuls in the new government
proclaimed in 1799.
<br>
<br>
As First Consul, Napoleon began a
programme to consolidate his power. He ended
the current rift between France and the Church
by instituting the Concordat of 1801. France was
then involved in several wars. In 1802, Napoleon
signed the Peace of Amiens, a temporary peace
with the British. In order to be able to concentrate
solely on his European affairs, he sold France's
Louisiana territory to the U.S. in 1803. In 1804,
he set the foundation for much of Europe's legal
system by establishing the Napoleonic Code. In
1804, Napoleon did away with the Consulate
and crowned himself Emperor in an extravagant
coronation ceremony.
In 1805, Napoleon was planning an invasion
of England when the Russian and Austrian
armies began marching towards France.
Napoleon's forces defeated them at Austerlitz,
but not before the British fleet had destroyed
Napoleon's navy at Trafalgar. At this time,
Napoleon expanded his Empire by creating the
Confederation of the Rhine in Germany and the
Grand Duchy of Warsaw in Poland. By now,
Napoleon controlled almost all of Western Europe
with the exception of Spain. He decided to try
and destroy the economy of his major enemy,
Britain, by instituting the Continental System,
under which all European ports would refuse to
accept British shipments. He failed in this task,
and in trying to force Spain to comply touched
off the Peninsular War. Russia and Prussia,
however, did cooperate with Napoleon for a few
years under the Treaty of Tilsit (1807).
<br>
<br>
Czar Alexander I withdrew Russia from the
Continental System. In 1812, Napoleon's Grand
Army entered Russia in order to punish
Alexander, but the ravages of the deadly Russian
winter decimated his army. Meanwhile, affairs
in France began to look unstable. Napoleon
rushed back to Paris and raised a new army,
only to be defeated by a coalition of European
forces at Leipzig in 1814.
Napoleon was then exiled to the isle of Elba,
where he plotted his return. With the great
powers of Europe deep in negotiations over how
to redivide the continent, Napoleon escaped from
Elba, sneaked into France, and raised a new army
in the period known as the Hundred Days. In
June 1815, the armies of Wellington and Blucher
defeated Napoleon at Waterloo. Napoleon was
again exiled, this time to distant Saint Helena in
the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Impact of Napoleon on Europe:</i></strong></div>

Napoleon saw his role as a modernizer of
Europe. Within the wide swathe of territory that
came under his control, Napoleon set about
introducing many of the reforms that he had
already introduced in France. Through a return
to monarchy Napoleon had, no doubt, destroyed
democracy in France, but in the administrative
field he had incorporated revolutionary principles
in order to make the whole system more rational
and efficient. The Civil Code of 1804 – usually
known as the Napoleonic Code – did away with
all privileges based on birth, established equality
before the law and secured the right to property.
This Code was exported to the regions under
French control. In the Dutch Republic, in
Switzerland, in Italy and Germany, Napoleon
simplified administrative divisions, abolished the
feudal system and freed peasants from serfdom
and manorial dues. In the towns too, guild
restrictions were removed. Transport and
communication systems were improved. Peasants,
artisans, workers and new businessmen enjoyed
a new-found freedom. He introduced many laws
such as the protection of private property and a
uniform system of weights and measures
provided by the decimal system. Businessmen
and small-scale producers of goods, in particular,
began to realize that uniform laws, standardized
weights and measures, and a common national
currency would facilitate the movement and
exchange of goods and capital from one region
to another. Initially, many saw Napoleon as a
liberator who would bring freedom for the people.
However, in the areas conquered, the reactions
of the local populations to French rule were
mixed. Initially, in many places such as Holland
and Switzerland, as well as in certain cities like
Brussels, Mainz, Milan and Warsaw, the French
armies were welcomed as harbingers of liberty.
But the initial enthusiasm soon turned to hostility,
as it became clear that the new administrative
arrangements did not go hand in hand with
political freedom. Increased taxation, censorship,
forced conscription into the French armies
required to conquer the rest of Europe, all seemed
to outweigh the advantages of the administrative
changes. Soon the Napoleonic armies came to be
viewed everywhere as an invading force. Many
of his measures that carried the revolutionary
ideas of liberty and modern laws to other parts
of Europe had an impact on people long after Napoleon had left.
