<h3>Industrialisation</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION</i></strong></div>

The Industrial Revolution was a
transformation of human life circumstances that
occurred in the late eighteenth and early
nineteenth centuries (roughly 1760 to 1840) in
Britain, the United States, and Western Europe
due in large measure to advances in the
technologies of industry. The Industrial
Revolution was characterized by a complex
interplay of changes in technology, society,
medicine, economy, education, and culture in
which multiple technological innovations
replaced human labour with mechanical work,
replaced sources like wood with mineral sources
like coal and iron, freed mechanical power from
being tied to a fixed running water source, and
supported the injection of capitalist practices,
methods, and principles into what had been an
agrarian society.
<br>
<br>
The Industrial Revolution marked a major
turning point in human history, comparable to
the invention of farming or the rise of the first
city- states—almost every aspect of daily life and
human society was, eventually, in some way
altered. As with most examples of change in
complex systems, the transformation referenced
by “Industrial Revolution” was really a whole
system effect wrought through multiple causes,
of which the technological advances are only
the most apparent.
<br>
<br>
Industrial Revolution started in the United
Kingdom in the early seventeenth century. The
Act of Union uniting England and Scotland
ushered in a sustained period of internal peace
and an internal free market without internal
trade barriers. Britain had a reliable and fast
developing banking sector, a straight forward
legal framework for setting up joint stock
companies, a modern legal framework and
system to enforce the rule of law, a developing
transportation system. In the latter half of the
1700s the manual labour based economy of the
Kingdom of Great Britain began to be replaced
by one dominated by industry and the
manufacture of machinery. It started with the
mechanization of the textile industries, the
development of iron-making techniques and the
increased use of refined coal. Once started, it
spread. Trade expansion was enabled by the
introduction of canals, improved roads and
railways. The introduction of steam power (fueled
primarily by coal) and powered machinery
(mainly in textile manufacturing) underpinned
the dramatic increases in production capacity.
The development of all-metal machine tools in
the first two decades of the nineteenth century
facilitated the manufacture of more production
machines for manufacturing in other industries.
The effects spread throughout Western Europe
and North America during the nineteenth
century, eventually affecting most of the world.
The impact of this change on society was enormous.
Industrial Revolution, its emergence in
England was primarily the result of the many
reasons. A few are briefly enumerated here. A
major increase in population; An agricultural
revolution, which was linked to population
growth and the application of new techniques
and machinery in cultivation; the application of
new techniques of production in the cotton and
iron and steel industries; the gradual
abandonment of cottage industry and a focus of
production in factories, where it could be more
rigorously supervised.
<br>
<br>
Character of British society also is stated to
have stimulated the rise of entrepreneurship.
The pursuit of wealth in trade and
manufacture or in the professions led to the
accumulation of fortunes which gave
individuals rank and status. Utter rejection of
such fortune as “tainted” was not a feature of
English society, as it was in Europe. Nobles
themselves invested in activities which linked
their estates to manufacturing.
In both France and Germany, the
construction of railways in the mid-nineteenth
century was crucial to the growth of industrial
capital. The development of industrial capitalism
in other countries (Russia, and Hungary for
instance) in the late nineteenth century was
primarily the result of capital investments from
the established industrial nations. However,
towards the end of nineteenth century, increasing
importance of markets in colonies and
underdeveloped regions of the world cannot be
denied for all these nations.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Agricultural Revolution and Industrial
Revolution</i></strong></div>

“Agricultural revolution”, which grew out
of the commercial agriculture of the seventeenth
and early eighteenth century was a major factor
responsible for the development of industrial
capitalism in England, and the “industrial
revolution”. In English agriculture, cultivation
was by and large market oriented by this time.
It was also specialized according to the
convenience of soil, climate, location and product.
e.g. Clay soil of the Midlands was ideal for wheat
production. Commercial production was
primarily on the farms of the large tenants of
greater and lesser landowners. These proprietors
were not concerned with the productivity of their
land as much as the rent it yielded, and they
instituted major improvements in order to assure
themselves of high rents.
<br>
<br>
Transfer of capital from agriculture to
industry was a major requirement of the rise of
industrial capitalism in the country. Equally
important for the rise of industrial capitalism was
the improvement in agricultural productivity and
the ample availability of food for seasonal and
perennial industrial labour. Such improvement
was initially the result of reorganization of
cultivation; but from the end of the eighteenth
century, improvement was also the result of the
application of industrial technology for
cultivation.
Many technology innovations were
introduced into like crop rotation of root crops
and legumes (beetroot, clover, sainfoin etc.),
which reinvigorated the soil, and allowed farmers
to forgo the necessity of leaving it uncultivated
(fallow) to avoid soil exhaustion. Mixing marls
(soil which was a mixture of carbonate of lime
and clay) were used in sandy soil, as a fertilizer.
Strips and commons were consolidated to
introduce improvements and increase
productivity to preserve income levels. This also
led to release of sizable sections of rural
population for industrial labour. Besides,
Enclosures by Acts of Parliament were
undertaken in large number from around 1759.
Under-drainage, which was necessary for
cultivation of heavy clay land, was begun
extensively in the 1820s.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Technical Innovations</i></strong></div>

The most famous inventions were as follows.
For the textile industry, most significant were
Kay’s Flying Shuttle (1733), which increased the
pace of weaving, Arkwright’s Spinning Jenny
(1769), and later more innovations revolutionized
spinning, i.e. Crompton’s “mule” of 1779
Arkwright’s water frame of 1785 and (for
weaving), Cartwright’s Power Loom of 1785. In
the coal and iron industry, the development of
coke by Abraham Darby (1709) and the use of
“pudding’ and hammering by Cort.
The innovations, on the other hand, in the
case of coke, altered the quality of coal, while
other innovations permitted the quick removal
of impurities. The application of steam power to
production through the Newcomen Engine (1705-
06) and, more significantly, James Watt’s engines,
allowed the running of large wooden and metal
machines. The innovations led to economies in
various aspects of production. Such innovation
also gave the entrepreneur greater flexibility.
Crucial for the iron industry was the process
which allowed the production of steel, a more
tensile and malleable product than iron. This was
the consequence of Henry Bessemer’s innovation
of 1856 whereby air blasts at the bottom of masses
of molten metal reduced the carbon content of
iron, producing steel: a process which was
perfected further by Sir William Siemens and
Pierre Martin (1866) in the open hearth process.
Demand, Market and Govt. Support
The increase in demand and labour that a
growing population supplied were crucial to
the development of industrial capitalism; and
substantial growth in population undoubtedly took place over the century, from 5.83
million in England and Wales in 1701 to 9.16
millions in 1801.
<br>
<br>
In this course of affairs, although, at home,
demand from the poorer classes undoubtedly led
to increase in agricultural production and the
transport industries which were linked to it, it
was middle class demand that merits attention.
There was a long history to this development,
but it created a market for substantial rather than
fine goods, in other words, those suitable for
machine production. A rise in income before 1740
and a combination of rise of middle classes and
growth of overseas market after 1740 gave a
substantial scope to the market for industrial
capitalism.
<br>
<br>
Large centers of production were controlled
by the government. Government orders for
munitions were of importance to the iron
industry, wool and textile industries. The
Navigation Act (initially passed in 1660), and
related legislation, were important to the
shipbuilding industry, since they required that
trade with the colonies and carriage of goods
from Asia, Africa and America could only be
done on English ships. Government followed a
protectionist policy of considerable scope (general
import duties rising from 10% in 1698 to 15% in
1704 to 20% in 1747, 25% in 1759, 30% in 1779
and 35% in 1782. Most celebrated was the duty
on corn imports, established by the Corn Law
(initially passed in 1670) by a sliding scale, which
varied from 25% of the home price to a minor
charge when that price was particularly high.
After the period of spirited growth described
above, industrial capitalism in Britain was
consolidated in the mid nineteenth century, partly
through participation in international
construction of railways. Other emerging
Industrial nations increasingly placed British
production under severe competition after the
1870s, which is described as the beginnings of
the Great Depression. This “depression” affected
both agriculture and industry: the former as a
result of the arrival of cheap grain from North
America on British markets from the 1870s, and
the latter because of competition from new
industrializing nations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Railways to Colonial Markets</i></strong></div>

The gradual development of steam-engine
drawn railway lines in England after the first
Darlington-Stockton rail was built (1825),
substantially affected the iron and coal industries
in Britain, which provided rolling stock, rail etc.
The railways contributed to “economies of scale”,
because, for a variety of industries, they cut
down the time taken for transport. If cotton had
been crucial to the economy of industrial
capitalism to the 1840s, it was coal and iron
which led thereafter.
<br>
<br>
Much of the industrial expansion of this
period was the consequence of the large amounts
of capital generated during the early phase of
the industrial revolution. Such capital inevitably
flowed to railways, given their considerable
attractions (the Stockton Darlington generated
15% interest on investment in 1839-41, and the
Liverpool-Manchester, a 10% dividend in 1830).
From the 1860, with increasing competition from
European economies and the economy of the
United States, the international position of British
industrial capitalism declined. The consequence
was the resort to underdeveloped and colonial
markets which became increasingly important
to the country by the end of the nineteenth
century.
Modern Industrial Society and New Classes
Capital accumulation in the countryside and
erosion of common communal rights led to
significant class formation within the peasantry
in most areas of Europe. All over Europe, the
development of capitalism and modern class
society meant the breakup of peasant societies,
and the differentiation of the peasantry into
classes ranging from the peasant petty
bourgeoisie to the rural proletariat. More than
anywhere else in Europe, the peasantry in Russia
became responsive to political appeals and played
a significant role in the overthrow of capitalism
and the establishment of the socialist regime. With
the development of capitalism in Europe that
rural conflicts became subsumed into the
fundamental dichotomy of Capital and Labour,
even as peasant agriculture remained alive and
the landlords remained privileged strata of
European societies.
<br>
<br>
This entire process of social restructuring that
ensured a smooth and profitable integration of
the landed aristocracy into the capitalist economy
and bourgeois society was helped along by the
political victory of the land-owning gentry, for
example, in the ‘Glorious Revolution’ after the
English Civil War, followed by the land
enclosures of the 18th century. Only from the
1880’s that we can seriously speak of the
declining wealth or political influence of the
landed gentry in England. Landlordism actually
vanished in Russia with the destruction of
capitalism itself.
<br>
<br>
The second half of the nineteenth century
can be characterized as the age of the bourgeoisie
in Western Europe, although in the eastern parts
the bourgeoisie having attained its own identity
and wealth, was yet to exert its hegemony.
Throughout Western Europe the wealthiest and
the most influential section of the bourgeoisie
were now bankers, factory owners and mine
owners, i.e. capitalists particularly after the
1850’s. The merchants lost their eminence as their
class gained hegemony. Commercial bourgeoisie
invested in urban property and land, participated
as actors on the political stage.
The virtues of the capitalist ethosindividualism, thrift, hard work, competition, use
of money power, family, were values basically
promoted by middle class, and came to dominate
industrial society as a whole. The bourgeoisie
also included the professional salaried component
that grew with the growth of bureaucracies, the
sectors of health and medicine, law and order,
education, publishing, printing and mass media,
and culture as an industry, with a new system
of patronage linked to mass production.
This entire bourgeoisie shared a critical
distance from the landed aristocracy and the
monarchies in their countries as they grew in
strength and significance, and despite the clear
differentiation among themselves were united in
their opposition to privilege and despotism. Social
democracy and the women’s movement, which
questioned the status quo, were born as a result
of these.
<br>
<br>
Numbers increased rapidly with the
expansion of services of various kinds under
capitalism: Retailing, marketing, distribution,
banking and finance. This led to emergence of
lower middle class. The lower middle class,
though highly stratified, can be divided into two
main groups – the classic petty bourgeoisie of
shopkeepers and small businessmen, and the new
white-collar salaried occupations, mostly clerks
but also commercial travellers, schoolteachers,
and certain shop assistants.
They stood for the broad features of the
capitalist economy, strongly defended the right
to private property and their goals were to aspire
to bourgeois status and climb higher in the social
ladder. They did not agitate to overthrow the
bourgeois social order or to challenge the right
to private property, even as they suffered the
consequences of increasing concentration of
production and trade, and lost out badly in the
ensuring competition. In the labour market too
their situation was precarious.
Industrialization may have reduced the
barriers between the landed classes and the
wealthy middle classes, but it sharpened the
differences between the middle class and the
labour class. This is one of the reasons for their
emerging as a political and social class despite
their varied composition. The city and social life
reflected the strong division of the rich and poor.
They had different spaces in the city to live in,
and the amenities and the facilities were quite
different.
<br>
<br>
The industrial revolution destroyed the
traditional world of the new factory worker. The
new worker was now entirely dependent on a
cash wage, subjected to a totally different work
rhythm dictated by the factory discipline and
the machine. Working conditions were terrible.
The new industrial working class bore the brunt
of the early industrial growth. Long hours of
work (15-16 hours, later 12 hours), unending
grind and terrible behaviour by the supervisors
often led to series of spontaneous worker riots.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political Consciousness and Class
Consciousness</i></strong></div>

Class experiences gave rise to classconsciousness on the part of the different sections
of society, which was expressed through differing
political affiliations. The bourgeoisie expressed
its political consciousness initially through
representing the general demands of society
against privilege and despotism. Increasingly it
began to give specific form and content to its
class interests through promoting economic
policies opposed to agriculture and landed
aristocracy and through gaining dominance in
the representative institutions. Although
ideologically it stood by liberalism, in practice it
supported and initiated centrist and right wing
parties as well to counter the working class
pressure.
The working people were the first to challenge
the capitalist order. Theirs is a story that began
with food riots and machine breaking and
evolved into varied forms of organized protests
that assumed great political significance.
In Europe, with the emergence of capitalism,
landlords and the peasantry were integrated with
the economy in different ways. At the same time,
in some countries the dominance of landed
interests continued to shape the society and
economy. This dominance of landed interest did
not allow the emerging bourgeoisie to attain an
independent identity or hegemony. Elsewhere,
the newly emerging classes had to struggle
politically to attain a new consciousness.
Impact over social and economic systems
Industrial revolution is synonymous with
certain technological and economic changes, with
important social consequences and social origins.
It denotes the extensive application of water,
steam (and later electrical) power in production
systems; the focus of production in the factory
and its formidable mechanization; major changes
in the character and exploitation of “home” and
“foreign” markets, and the near disappearance
of subsistence agriculture.
<br>
<br>
Industrial society cannot survive without
universal literacy. Education which was a cottage
industry in the agrarian world, must now become
full-fledged, impersonal and organized modern
industry to turn out neat, uniform human
product out of the raw material of an uprooted
anonymous mass population.
An industrial society is one in which work is
not manual but semantic. Modern economy does
not just need a worker; it needs a skilled worker.
It is mobile society; it is an egalitarian society;
and it is a society with a shared high-culture
and not exclusive as it was in the agrarian world.
A peasant’s son need not be a peasant; what
occupational position he occupies will depend,
not on his heredity or community’s status, but
on his own competence and training.
Land inevitably attracted investment and
loans, but industry, with its few guarantees was
a different matter. Until mid-eighteenth century,
entrepreneurs lent to themselves within the same
trade, or drew on the funds that merchants
made available to them. They could also call for
loans on goldsmiths and others who dealt in
precious metals. With a pickup of commercial
activity in agriculture and industry, such
“bankers” were joined by various country banks
which were set up during periods of expanding
trade after mid-century. They were also backed
by London banks in times of difficulty. A network
existed, therefore, for redistributing resources at
the time that manufacturing industry increasingly
came to require it.
<br>
<br>
Industry was increasingly rationalized. Here,
rationalization implied the subordination of
production to calculation—a development which
had been less important earlier, since hired labour
and technology were rarely concentrated in one
place, where the influence of the capitalist could
exert itself effectively. Among the consequences
of such change were economies of scale, where,
as production increased, each unit of
manufacture became cheaper in terms of costs
of production. A diminution of dependence on
natural forces (climate, cardinally) followed from
the integration of markets
Major changes in ecological balance resulted
from the scale of demand and production: well
known here is the deforestation of large sections
of the United States and Russia, and the
destruction of wild herds in the United States.
An important feature was also the rigorous
subordination of economic activity to the troughs
and booms of the trade cycle, whose nature
varied in accordance with alterations in
investment and consumption.
<br>
<br>
‘Gradualist’ argument which stressed
continuities with earlier demographic regime and
slow growth of industrial productivity has been
criticized for not taking into account the
substantial contributions of female and child
labour and for not taking a connected regional
picture of emerging industrialization.
The peculiar importance of youth labour in
the industrial revolution are highlighted in several
instances of textile and other machinery being
designed and build to suit the child worker. The
spinning jenny was a celebrated case; the original
country jenny had a horizontal wheel requiring
a posture most comfortable for children aged nine
to twelve. Indeed, for a time, in the very early
phases of mechanization and factory
organization in the woollen and silk industries
as well as in cotton, it was generally believed
that child labour was integral to textile machine
design.
Bureaucratization can be said to
encompass the processes both of the centralization
and expansion and of the professionalization of
all institutions. Bureaucratization has been a
result & cause of and similar to industrialization.
Generating and exploiting material resources took
the form of industrialization; doing the same with
human resources took the form of social
mobilization. Entirely new institutions and
professions were required for these activities; and
the emergence of professional bureaucracies takes
place against this background. The first of these
were the direct servants of the state, the civil
servants and the armed forces. Bureaucratization
was accompanied by a campaign against
“corruption” and in the cause of “efficiency.”
Geographical Spread of IR United States
As in Britain, the United States originally used
water power to run its factories, with the
consequence that industrialization was essentially
limited to New England and the rest of the
Northeastern United States, where fast-moving
rivers were located. However, the raw materials
(cotton) came from the Southern United States.
It was not until after the American Civil War in
the 1860s that steam-powered manufacturing
overtook water-powered manufacturing,
allowing the industry to spread across the entire
nation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Samuel Slater (1768–1835)</b> is popularly known
as the founder of the American cotton industry.
As a boy apprentice in Derbyshire, England, he
learned of the new techniques in the textile
industry and defied laws against the emigration
of skilled workers by leaving for New York in
1789, hoping to make money with his knowledge.
Slater started Slater’s mill at Pawtucket, Rhode
Island, in 1793, and went on to own thirteen
textile mills.
While on a trip to England in 1810,
Newburyport, Massachusetts merchant Francis
Cabot Lowell was allowed to tour the British
textile factories, but not take notes. Realizing the
War of 1812 had ruined his import business but
that a market for domestic finished cloth was
emerging in America, he memorized the design
of textile machines, and on his return to the
United States, he set up the Boston
Manufacturing Company. Lowell and his
partners built America’s first cotton-to-cloth
textile mill at Waltham, Massachusetts. After his
death in 1817, his associates built America’s first
planned factory town, which they named after
him. This enterprise was capitalized in a public
stock offering, one of the first such uses of it in
the United States. Lowell, Massachusetts,
utilizing 5.6 miles of canals and ten thousand
horsepower delivered by the Merrimack River, is
considered the “Cradle of the American
Industrial Revolution.’ The short-lived, utopialike Lowell System was formed, as a direct
response to the poor working conditions in
Britain. However, by 1850, especially following
the Irish Potato Famine, the system was replaced
by poor immigrant labour.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Continental Europe</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Industrial Revolution on Continental</i></strong></div>


Europe came later than in Great Britain. In many
industries, this involved the application of
technology developed by Britain in new places.
Often the technology was purchased from Britain,
or British engineers and entrepreneurs in search
of new opportunities abroad. By 1809, part of
the Ruhr Valley in Westphalia were being called
“Miniature England” because of its similarities
to the industrial areas of England. The German,
Russian, and Belgian governments did all they
could to sponsor the new industries by the
provisions of state funding.
In some cases (such as iron), the different
availability of resources locally meant that only
some aspects of the British technology were
adopted.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Japan</i></strong></div>

In 1871, a group of Japanese politicians
known as the Iwakura Mission toured Europe
and the U.S. to learn western ways. The result
was a deliberate, state led industrialization policy
to prevent Japan from falling behind. The Bank
of Japan, founded in 1877, used taxes to fund
model steel and textile factories. Education was
expanded and Japanese students were sent to
study in the west.
<br>
<br>
A brief discussion of how IR spread to France
and Germany is important to understand and
internalize the overall history of industrialization.
Major improvements in cultivation were
introduced in many regions of France especially
in the north east, i.e. French Flanders (where
innovation in agriculture in Holland and Belgium
had initially made their way to England and
were now quickly disseminated). Knowledge of
“improving methods” which were prevalent in
England and elsewhere came to be known
through publications such as Duhamel du
Monceau’s 6-volume introduction to improving
agriculture, through cheap literature and by
word-of-mouth. Partly as a result of the
application of “improving” techniques,
substantial increase in agricultural production
was registered during 1725-1789.
Since much cultivation on peasant land was
still based on the three-field rotation in an open
field, improvements were difficult to initiate on
smaller holdings and strips. Hence, on the
standard and smaller peasant holdings, where
the open field was less known, land was
increasingly insufficient to provide the
requirements of a growing family. Although
commercialization in agriculture was substantial,
and major surpluses of grain were available for
growing urban population, large fluctuations and
disparities in income levels were a feature of the
French countryside, as was dire poverty in
certain quarters.
<br>
<br>
A rapidly-growing internal market for
manufactured goods, though, was not a feature
of initial manufacturing development; for this
was prevented by major problems of trade within
the country, and the problems of industrial
organization and capital availability. The country
was far from uniform in its administration, and
could not strictly be treated as a well integrated
market by traders and producers. Industry was
curbed by guild restrictions. Country banks were
not available in the country. Unlike England, the
practice of trade and manufacture attracted social
disapproval among the French elite, among
whom status by privilege, either through venal
offices (i.e. official positions which could be
bought), or through titles of nobility.
A considerable portion of the political and
social reconstruction of France during the 1789-
1815 periods had major economic repercussions,
and affected the position of industrial capitalism
within the country. These include the attack on
privilege and the consequent changes in land
tenure, and the abolition of guild structures; and
equally important, the impact of war and
expansion of trade and production.
The sudden influx of cheap goods from
England after the end of the Napoleonic Wars
immediately led to decline in demand for many
items of French manufacture on the Continent,
and confronted producers with the possibility of
bankruptcy. It was almost natural, therefore, that
the government of the country’s Restoration rulers
(Louis XVIII and Charles X), turned to a
continuation of Napoleonic and preRevolutionary policies to “protect” national
industry.
<br>
<br>
Demands for free trade coincided with the
industrial growth of the 1830s and 1840s. But
still much production focused in small units,
which explains the popularity of protection until
1848; and that production was dependent on
less productive water power. Beyond
international circumstances, much of the increase
in production in France was the consequence of
the interventionism of the Bonapartist state under
the Second Empire. Here government
encouragement of growth, prompted by
Napoleon Ill’s Saint Simonian principles, was
evident in the official assistance to the creation
of the Credit Foncier (a national mortgage bank)
and the Credit Mobilier (a joint-stock bank).
Following the defeat of France in the FrancoPrussian War (1870-71), a general impression
prevailed for several decades that the country
experienced a decline. However, the impression
always bore reference to comparisons with
Germany and the United States.
France showed substantial headway in
research and development in the fields of
chemicals production and the electrical industries.
e.g. Solvay process for soda, dyestuff research,
electrical and telegraph and telephone
manufacturing research are some areas where
France showed considerable growth. In general,
the loss of Alsace and Lorraine in 1871 (to
Germany) was less significant for French
industrial capitalism than may initially appear.
In Germany, many circumstances hindered
economic growth of a more substantial nature.
Availability of labour was poor for much of the
eighteenth century in certain areas – the
consequences of heavy mortality during the wars
of the time (the War of the Austrian Succession
and the Seven Years’ War). The territory of the
German states, moreover, did not provide
manufacturers with a well-integrated market,
since each state had its tolls and duties, and
transit required the payment of these.
Other problems of significance were: quality,
for instance, of the coal and iron deposits in the
region. In the East of the region, labour mobility
was severely restricted by the prevalence of
serfdom. Capital supply was, unlike Britain and
like France, limited to the wealth of powerful
traders and manufacturers, and could not call
on a wider network of availability of capital
Such problems became of decreasing
significance with the Serf Emancipation in the
1800s, the creation of the Zollverein (the Prussiacentered customs’ union) in the 1830s, the
dismantling of paternalist conventions in 1848-
49, and the creation of joint-stock banks on
French model in the 1850s. Together, these
developments lay the foundation of the industrial
boom of the middle decades of the nineteenth
century, and, following the formation of the
German empire, industrial capital systematically
developed on this basis.
<br>
<br>
The character of capitalism in the region was
decisively influenced by official measures that
were taken in the area during the period 1789-
1815. In the first case, the industrial settlements
of the Rhineland underwent the dismantling of
the guilds, and the abolition of their privileges –
which improved the status of competitors in a
number of industries and gave greater scope to
innovation. The Continental system increased
demand for the products of this region. The
impact of serf emancipation, though, in Prussia
was limited but decisive and ubiquitous.
Crucial also to economic growth after 1815
was the gradual development of large regional
markets in the 1820s, before the formation of the
Prussia centered Zollverein (Customs Union) in
1834. Within such a system of trade agreements,
the development of railways in the German states
acted as a major stimulus to production and
innovation in the enclaves of iron and coal
production in Silesia and in the Rhineland.
Railway lines allowed the extension of a home
market which was reasonably well-knot around
the internal river system based around the Rhine,
the Elbe and the Oder, all of which had canal
networks working off them.
In total it can be said that the France and
German industrial capitalism was constrained by
a peasantry tied to land on the one hand
(fragmented holdings held by customary rights
in France and serfdom in Germany) and the
dominance of big landed institution, on the other.
As a consequence of the above, the state played
a crucial role in (a) creating uniform legislative
measures, (b) financing of industry and (c)
creating a common market. In France, however,
an important role was played by the period of
French revolution when the attack on privilege
loosened the tight grip of nobility and the guilds.
The growth of industrial capitalism in Russia
struggled with the country’s persistent
backwardness. In the process a major role was
played by the state which tried to mobilize a
labour force by ‘emancipation of serfs,’ took
policy initiatives like bringing in foreign capital
for investment and took major initiative in setting
up centres of industry. Insufficient growth in the
agricultural sector tended to reinforce
backwardness.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Models of development</i></strong></div>

W.W. Rostow, in his discussion of the stages
of economic growth argues that growth follows
five stages:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditional society, where innovation
occurs in both industry and agriculture,
but there is a limit on “the level of
attainable output per head”.</li>
        <li>Societies “in a process of transition” in
“the period when the pre-conditions for
take-off are developed”, where
transition might be the result of
circumstances where “the insights of
modern science began to be translated
into new production functions” in
agriculture and industry. An
“intrusion” thus created would lead to
the path towards modernity.</li>
        <li>The stage of take-off which is “the
interval when old blocks and
resistances to steady growth are finally
overcome”, where “enclaves of modern
activity” expand and dominate society,
and where “growth becomes the
normal condition”. Here investment of
the Gross National Product of GNP
must increase from about 5% upto 10%
on average, and it must be marked by
large reinvestment in industries and
large scale changes in agriculture. It is a stage to be seen in Britain in the twenty
years after 1783; in France and the USA in the
decades before 1860; in Germany in the 1850-
1875; period; and in Russia and Canada in the
twenty-five years before 1914. The cardinal
elements and periodicity of this perspective are
not easily justified. Many of Rostow’s preconditions for take-off are themselves, for
instance, features of take-off itself: in the case of
the French economy, no significant period of takeoff is discernible.</li>
        <li>The drive to maturity, when an economy
become fully part of an international
economy, the significance of established
leading sectors decline and investment
stands at 10-20% of GNP.</li>
        <li>The stage of high mass consumption,
where greater resources are devoted to
social welfare, and where the focus of the
economy shifts from leading sectors to
durable consumer goods.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Alexander Gerschenkron, on the other hand,
in his discussion of backwardness in historical
perspective, argues that stress on “preconditions”
or “take-off” is unwarranted, since these hardly
exist in any consistent way in industrialization.
He feels that “the development of a backward
country tend to differ fundamentally from that
of an advanced country”.
<br>
<br>
Gerschenkron proposes that the nature of the
industrialization process in a backward country
shows differences when compared with
advanced countries in the rate of industrial
growth and, in its organization and nature of
production. These consequences are the result of
the application of “institutional instruments” for
which no counterpart exists in established
industrial nations. The intellectual climate of
industrialization is substantially different. “The
extent to which these attributes of backwardness
occurred in individual instances appears to have
varied directly with the degree of backwardness
and the natural industrial potentialities of the
countries concerned”.
Novel banking networks and the intervention
of the state are the “institutional instruments”
that Gerschenkron isolates as crucial to
industrialization in “backward” states of Europe.
Hence in France, a new form of banking emerged
during the reign of Napoleon III, which changed
the direction of established wealth and established
a model of banking which thereafter became
widely established on the continent. This model
was developed in new directions in Germany. In
Russia, on the other hand, the state was inspired
by military interests to establish a firm path
towards industrialization. Different paths
followed by different countries for
industrialization drives home the point that there
can be no one-stop solution for the general
underdevelopment in developing countries of
world. Every nation has to fine tune its strategy
keeping in mind its specific concerns.
Ideological Criticisms
<br>
<br>
Path towards capitalist ‘Industrial revolution’
was not accepted unanimously but an ideological
and intellectual criticism of earlier growth models
was vigorously pursued. Criticism pursued
mercantilists who were concerned with the
methods the state might use to promote
prosperity, through regulation of foreign trade;
criticism was also leveled against physiocrats who
were mainly concerned with general
improvements in the productivity of the land. A
proper integration of the various forces which
were crucial to capitalism (population,
entrepreneurship, demand, rent, profit, state
policy etc.) were achieved by Adam Smith (1723-
1790), David Ricardo (1772-1823) and Thomas
Robert Malthus. Smith, in his Inquiry into the
Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations
established a critique of mercantilism and
physiocracy. He supported the principle of laissez
faire. Smith accepted the occurrence of social
disparities when individuals pursued their own
ends; but he was optimistic that overall
prosperity would ensure, and that a degree of
“harmony” with the onset of ‘perfect’ competition in prosperity would exist in social relations.
Objections were raised by others thinkers
against the capitalist industrialization. Ricardo
was convinced that steady increase in rent, which
would follow more production and a growing
population, might be the foundation of economic
crises. Malthus, on the other hand, saw a rising
population, which was the necessary
consequence of growth, as the ultimate brake on
prosperity. “Utilitarian” views, associated with
Jeremy Bentham that some role for government
was still to be found in the pursuit of prosperity
were further strengthend in face of such
criticisms. These were aimed primarily to ensure
the “greatest happiness of the greatest number”,
which might, in various circumstances, be
threatened by the greed of the minority.
Smith’s optimism regarding the ability of
classes to arrive at a harmonious pursuit of
prosperity, despite disparities of income, was
challenged by Socialist writers. Sismonde de
Sismondi (1773-1842), saw production increasing
rapidly within capitalist development, but also
foresaw a growth of inequalities, which could
not be resolved, except through state intervention.
<br>
<br>
Proudhon (1809-1868), considered that the
injustices which were linked to inequalities must
be ameliorated by “mutualism” or the activities
of voluntary associations which would perform
the regulatory functions of an interventionist
state. Karl Marx (1818-1883) attempted to isolate
the course that inequality would run, and argued
that capitalism itself would collapse eventually.
 A revolution in human life
To speak of the Industrial Revolution is to
identify only the most immediately obvious
aspects of a total social revolution that occurred
during the period called the Industrial Revolution.
The short-term effects were in many cases
drastic as traditional family-centered agrarian
lifestyles with all family members playing a role
were torn asunder by long hours of tedious
factory work required of men, women, and
children if the family were to earn enough to
survive. These new work patterns, over time,
fostered the emergence of laws, regulations,
inspectors, and labour unions to protect factory
workers from exploitation by the factory owners.
Aided by these protections, families became more
stable and factory workers in the cities became
the source of an emergent middle class occupying
such positions as managers or independent
entrepreneurs or government employees.
Over the long term, the Industrial Revolution
marked a period in which the living standard of
the people in the affected countries rose
tremendously as did the power of the human
species to use technology for exploiting nature to
human purpose and the image of the human
being as the rightful dominating owner of the
natural world. The resulting destructive
consumption of the natural world has grown to
such dimensions that in recent decades equally
powerful counter currents calling for sustainable
development and responsible stewardship of
nature have arisen.
<br>
<br>
While the Industrial Revolution contributed
to a great increase in the GDP per capita of the
participating countries, the spread of that greater
wealth to large numbers of people in general
occurred only after one or two generations during
which the wealth was disproportionately
concentrated in the hands of a relatively few.
Still, it enabled the ordinary to enjoy a standard
of living far better than that of their forebears.
Traditional agrarian societies had generally been
more stable and progressed at a much slower
rate before the advent of the Industrial Revolution
and the emergence of the modern capitalist
economy. In countries affected directly by it, the
Industrial Revolution dramatically altered social
relations, creating a modern, urban society with
a large middle class. In most cases, the GDP has
increased rapidly in those capitalist countries that
follow a track of industrial development, in a
sense recapitulating the Industrial Revolution.
