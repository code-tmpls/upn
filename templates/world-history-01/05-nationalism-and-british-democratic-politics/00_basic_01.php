<h3>Nationalism and British Democratic Politics</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>NATIONALISM AND BRITISH
DEMOCRATIC POLITICS</i></strong></div>

Nationalism is an ideology and belief that the
people of a single territory should have a common
culture, and with it, a sovereign state.
Nationalism is a modern phenomenon, dating
from the eighteenth century; when it combines
with the modern state in that territory, the
product is known as the nation-state. The
creation of the nation-state system thus witnessed
the development of nation-states out of existing
states (France and Britain) or through the
unification of a number of smaller ones (Germany
and Italy).
<br>
<br>
At the same time, the process entailed the
break-up of existing territorial states into a
number of national units. The prime examples of
this process were the Russian, Habsburg, and
Ottoman empires. Hence their pattern of
formation went through three phases; the first
of scholars propagating the idea of a single
nation by promoting its language, folklore, and
history; the second of journalism disseminating
the idea of the nation through popular
publications in the national language; and the
third of political movements espousing these
doctrines to work for the nation-state. When
international diplomacy and war combined with
these factors, as especially during and after the
First World War, a number of such nation-states
established themselves.
Until the French revolutionary wars, states
engaged in war and diplomacy; thereafter it was
nations, or more strictly, nation-states.
Nationalism has clearly emerged as the most
dominant political force during the course of the
last two centuries. Modern man does not simply
think; he thinks as French or German or as an
Indian. One of the most prominent features of
modern state is nationalism. Nationalism has
become one of most important instruments of
mobilization and effectively it leads to selfmobilization. For nearly 150 years between the
Congress of Vienna in 1815 and the end of the
Second World War in 1945, nationalism was the
lone promoter of nation-states.
Although it is possible to trace the idea of the
nation to the earliest times and certainly to the
16th century – as in the case of the German
word Volk for people - there is considerable
unanimity among historians that nationalism is
a modern concept. Despite other disagreements,
scholars like Benedict Anderson, Ernest Gellner
and Eric Hobsbawm agree that nationalism is a
phenomenon which emerged in the eighteenth
century in Western Europe and then spread
during the 19th and 20th centuries to other parts
of the world.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Proto-Nationalism Before 1789</i></strong></div>

Several 19th Century Observers believed that
elements of nationalism emerged in the medieval
period - a sense of ethnic or linguistic or national
identity. This can be called a form of patriotism
or of protonationalism. The 19th century French
historian and politician Guizot believed that the
Hundred Years War between England and
France (1337-1453) – provoked by the claim of
the king of England to the throne of France –
brought together the nobility, burghers and
peasantry in a common desire to defeat the
foreigners who had attacked and plundered
France. Though modern historians regard this as
a period of crises marked by war, plague and
famine; it did create a sense of patriotism. The
four different nationalities which created a
modern state in 1648 managed to create a distinct
Swiss national consciousness only by 1848 after
the victory of the liberals and the drafting of a
new federal Constitution.
<br>
<br>
The 19th century is regarded as a century of
nationalism – a period in which the idea of the
nation state based on Britain and France was
generalized and perceived as the universal
principle for modern societies. It is the considered
view of historians that nationalism in the modern
sense emerged with the growth of industrial
capitalism or print capitalism and was then
sustained by a variety of factors – by notions of
community based on language, ethnicity or
religion or by the rivalry and competition among
states and imagined communities.
<br>
<br>
The big change in the attitude towards
nationality and nationalism came about in the
late 19th century with the growth of mass
political movements in the era of democratic
politics. After 1880 the debate about the national
question becomes important with the need to
mobilize voters for different political parties and
to gain adherents for new ideologies whether
among socialists or minor linguistic and national
groupings. In the later stage of mass politics and
national movements, the state played an active
role. Colonel Pilsudski, the liberator of Poland,
in fact observed, “It is the state which makes the
nation and not the nation the state”. Whatever
view one takes of the relations between nation
and state, it was electoral democracy which
undermined the liberal theory of the nation.
The exercise of power in modern European
states was different from any form that preceded
it. It was marked especially by the absolute power
of the modern state, and the correspondingly
enormous mobilization of the population over
which these states exercised their powers.
Nationalism was the driver of this type of
mobilization.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Defining the Un-Definable</i></strong></div>

The earliest attempt to define a nation was
made in 1882 by Ernest Renan, a French scholar.
He defined nation, as a “human collectively
brought together by will, consciousness and
collective memory” (and also common
forgetfulness, or a collective amnesia). He called
the nation as an exercise in everyday plebiscite.
The strength of Renan’s definition lay in providing
a voluntaristic (as against naturalistic) component
to the understanding of nation. He forcefully
rejected the notion that nations were created by
natural boundaries like mountains, rivers and
oceans. He emphasized the role of human will
and memory in the making of a nation.
According to Renan, human collectivity or
grouping can will itself to form a nation. The
process of the creation of a nation is not
defendant upon any natural or objective criteria
and a nation, in order to be, is not obliged to
fulfil any of the objection conditions.
<br>
<br>
Stalin offered a much sharper and
comprehensive understanding of nations.
According to him, ‘A nation is a historically
constituted, stable community of people,’ formed
on the basis of a common language, territory,
economic life and psychological make-up
manifested in a common culture.’ If Renan’s
definition-net was too wide catching nations as
well as many non-nations, Stalin’s definition
tended to be a bit narrow, leaving out significant
nations.
Though Renan offered an ‘idealist’ definition
of the nation as against the ‘materialist’ analysis
of Stalin, both authors believed that there was
nothing eternal or everlasting about nations.
Nations had a beginning and they would also
have an end.
Within the Marxist tradition, the definition
of the nation has evolved from the writings of
Marx and Engels, through Lenin and Stalin, to
those of Hobsbawm. Broadly speaking, within
this tradition the nation is regarded as a
historically evolved phenomenon which emerges
only with decline of feudalism and the rise of
capitalism. Tribes, clans and peoples existed prior
to the emergence of capitalism but it was because
of new economic relations produced by the
emergence of the capitalist mode of production
that nations were created. Nationalism was
regarded as an ideological construct which
enabled the bourgeoisie to identify its interests as
a class with the interests of the whole society.
Hobsbawm also emphasizes that nations and
nationalist aspirations have to be examined in
“the context of a particular stage of technological
and economic development.” Though essentially
constructed from above, nationalism cannot be
understood unless it is also analyzed from below”
in terms of the assumptions, hopes, needs,
longings and interests of ordinary people which
are not necessarily national and still less
nationalist”.
<br>
<br>
Friedrich List in ‘The National System of
Political Economy’ stated that, “a large
population and an extensive territory endowed
with manifold national resources, are essential
requirements of the normal nationality. It is this
tacit liberal assumption of a certain size of states
which Hobsbawm calls the “threshold principle”
of nationality which the liberal bourgeoisie
broadly endorsed from about 1830-1880. It is this
threshold principle of nationality which is shared
by figures as far apart as John Stuart Mill,
Friedrich Engels and Mazzini. It is this principle
which explains why Mazzini, the apostle of
nationalism, did not support the cause of Irish
independence. The principle of national selfdetermination in the period of Mill and Mazzini
was therefore substantially different from that in
the period of the American President, Woodrow
Wilson.
<br>
<br>
The modern concept of the nation emerged
during the Age of Revolution, the American
Revolution of 1776 and the French Revolution of
1789. In America political discourse did not
emphasize the unitary aspect of nationalism -
the Americans were concerned with the
inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness, with the proper relation between
the American union and the states and with
development of a liberal capitalist society. By
contrast, in France the nation was conceived as
“one and indivisible’. The idea of the nation was
inextricably linked up with mass participation,
citizenship and collective sovereignty of the
people or of a given nationality.
Hobsbawm draws a distinction between the
revolutionary democratic and the nationalist
conception of the nation. In the revolutionary
democratic view of the nation the sovereign
citizen people within a state constituted a nation
in relation to others whereas in the nationalist
view the “prior existence” of same distinguishing
features of a community, setting it apart from
others, was necessary to constitute a nation.
Hans Kohn, argues that “nationalities are
products of the living forces of history and
therefore always fluctuating never rigid,”
Nationalities are not identical with clans, tribes
or folk-groups nor are they the simple outcome
of common descent or common habitat. Kohn
argues: “Ethnographic groups like these existed
throughout history, from earliest times on, yet
they do not form nationalities; they are nothing
but ‘ethnographic material’, out of which under
certain circumstances a nationality might arise.
Even if a nationality arises, it may disappear
again, absorbed into a larger or new nationality”.
Kohn argued that “both the idea and the
form of nationalism were developed before the
age of nationalism”. The idea of nationalism is
traceable to the ancient Hebrews and Greeks.
The idea of the chosen people, the consciousness
of national history and national mechanism were
three traits of nationalism which emerged with
the ancient Jews. But he acknowledges that,
despite their “fierce nationalist ideology”, the
Greeks lacked “political nationalism’ and there
was only a brief period of patriotism during the
Persian Wars.
<br>
<br>
According to Ernest Gellner, nations are best
understood in the spirit of nationalism. Contrary
to popular belief it is not nations that lead to
nationalism. But, nations are created by
nationalism. The three components-will (Renan),
culture (Stalin) and ideology (Gellner)- complete
definition of nation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Emergence of Nationalism</i></strong></div>

The present day congruence of nation and
state (emergence of nation-state) is a product of
specific development in human history. Arrival
of the industrial era increased this division of
labour manifold, thereby ensuring a long life for
the state. State, under conditions of industrial
economy, was no longer an option; it became a
necessity.
<br>
<br>
According to Ernest Gellner: ‘nationalism is
political principle that holds that national and
political units should be congruent.’ For this
coming to state and nation, there are clearly three
preconditions-there should be a state; there
should be a nation; and finally, they should be
nationalism to tell the other two that they are
meant for each other and cannot live without
each other.
The citizens of the agrarian world lived in
laterally insulated cultural groupings. It was an
agglomeration of communities of common people.
They lived in stable cultural formations, not
particularly informed about the presence of other
groups. Written word was rarely available to
them. They lived their culture without ever
articulating it. They could not write and to
understand what was written, they relied upon
the clergy or the Ulema or Brahmin.
Compared to agrarian society an industrial
society was a society based on perpetual growthboth economic and cognitive. The industrial
society showed a tremendous commitment to
continuous change and growth. It was a literate
society. Literacy in the agrarian world was
confined to the exclusive high-culture, in other
words to the king, priest and the scholar.
However, the reality was that universal suffrage
did not come to West Europe till 1870 and in
East Europe till 1919. Thus it was mainly the
educated, urbane middle class who pursued the
ideology of nationalism and liberalism and built
movements around them.
<br>
<br>
The role of social status does not completely
diminish in the industrial society, but it loses the
eminence that it enjoyed in the agrarian world.
A marriage of culture and polity is the only
precondition to man’s dignified survival in such
a world of dissolving identities.
His national identity becomes important to
him and only a state representative of his nation
can ensure the preservation of this identity. This
is nationalism. And this is why modern man is
a nationalist. Modern state needs not only trained
men but also committed and loyal men. They
must follow the instructions of the state in which
they live, and of no other subdivision within the
territory. Only nationalism can ensure this.
Different Routes taken by Nationalism
Anthony Smith has attempted a division of a
world into different types of routes that
nationalism takes in its journey towards creation
of nation-states. The creation of nation-states has
taken two routes; Gradualist and nationalist. The
gradualist route is generally conflict free and
contest free and is one where the initiative was
taken by the state to create conditions for the
spread of nationalism.
<br>
<br>
Nation-states were thus formed either by
direct state sponsored patriotism or were the
result of colonization (Australia and Canada:
they did not have to fight for independence) or
provincialism where cultures/states just ceded
from the imperial power, were granted
independence and were on their way towards
becoming nation-states. One feature of the
gradualist route is that it was marked by the
absence of conflict, violence, contesting claims
over national hood or any national movement.
The other, nationalist route is characterized by
rupture, conflict, violence and earth-moving.
Smith divides this rupture-ridden route into
two sub-routes those of ethnic nationalism and
territorial nationalism. The ethnic sub-route is
divided into two lanes-based on renewal and
secession. Renewal is based on the renewal or
the revival of a declining ethnic identity like Persia
in the 1890s. The secessionist lane could be
further divided into three by-lanes of breakaway,
Diaspora and irredentist nationalism. The
breakaway group sought to sever a bond through
cessation. Bangladesh that broke away from
Pakistan in 1991 could also come in the same
category. The Diaspora nationalism is best
represented by the Jews. The irredentist
nationalism normally followed a successful
national movement. If the new state did not
include all the members of the ethnic group, these
will demand the nation. Territorial nationalism
occurred when a heterogeneous population was
coercively united by a colonial power.
Nationalism is a territorial ideology which is
internally unifying and externally divisive.
Authorities as Max Weber and Lenin have argued
that nations and nationalism have to be seen
“primarily in political terms in relation to
statehood”. Nationalism is an ideology which
links culturally and historically defined territorial
communities called nations, to political statehood.
Three ways in which nationalism has shaped
the modern state have been identified. In the
older states like England and France the rise of
nationalism was linked to the development of
more democratic relationships between the state
and civil society. Secondly, nationalism furthers
the internal unification of culturally and
economically diverse regions into a more
homogenous state territory. Finally, nationalism
divides one political community or nation from
another and even determines the geographical
boundaries of the nation in many cases.
Nationalism can support both movements of
unification and separation. In Italy and Germany,
nationalism and the state created a new nation
state. In Scandinavia, nationalism produced the
separation of Norway from Sweden.
<br>
<br>
As a result of the growth of industrialization,
of the rise of the working class and socialism,
and of inter-imperialist rivalries, nationalism
became associated with conservative and right
wing ideologies not just with the republican ideas
of the French Revolution.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Factors Affecting Spread and Growth of
Nationalism</i></strong></div>

The process of democratization in the first
half of the 19th century was accelerated not only
by revolutions but by a gradual process of socioeconomic change; the growth of industries and
the new social classes of the bourgeoisie and
workers.
<br>
<br>
As the economy developed new social classes,
of which the emergence of the working class in
particular posed new problems for the 19th
century modernizing state and the liberal
bourgeoisie. After the 1832 Reform Act in Britain
the struggle of the liberal middle class parted
company with the struggles of the working
classes. The inclusion of the propertied middle
classes within the framework of electoral
democracy was typically achieved in several
European states by the mid 19th century. It was
the emergence of the labour and socialist
movement in the late 19th century which affected
the balance of social forces. The rise of the Social
Democratic Party in Germany during the late
19th century affected the position of the liberal
bourgeoisie vis-à-vis the conservatives in the
German politics and society. Mass participation
– even the participation of a broad based socialist
party - did not successfully democratize German
society, though the extent of pre-World War I
German conservatism has been exaggerated.
<br>
<br>
The modernization of states was
accompanied by the development of a centralized
administration and a large bureaucracy based
on rational-legal principles. This process was
accompanied by the development of a national
language, of a language of administration and
not merely local communication. The choice of a
dialect or language as the medium of official
communication led to public or state support for
its propagation, especially through the school
system. The growth of a professional middle class
and of modern state bureaucracies were based
on the growth of modern universities, law and
journalism. The expansion of secondary school
system and the state choice of the official or
national language in schools became a source of
great conflict among rival ethnic linguistic groups
within multi-ethnic states like Austria-Hungary
and in Eastern Europe in general. However, in
earlier periods language had been less divisive
because literacy levels were very low.
The modern state and its administrative
innovations themselves sharpened a sense of
linguistic identity among the general population.
The statisticians and census data collectors from
the 1860s onwards sought data on language.
Hobsbawm observes, “In truth, by asking the
language question, censuses for the first time
forced everyone to choose not only a nationality,
but a linguistic nationality”.
<br>
<br>
In older states like Britain and France a statebased patriotism itself encouraged a sense of
nationalism during the course of the 19th
century. The patriotism of the working classes in
Europe did not deny the chasm between classes
but affirmed its loyalty to the nation state. The
most significant illustration of this is the manner
in which the working class and socialist parties
of the Second International which had repeatedly
passed political resolutions condemning the idea
of an imperialist war and emphasizing the
international character of the struggle of the
socialist parties very quickly identified with their
nations and their national interest once the First
World War broke out. It is evident that Socialists
and Marxists had underestimated the power of
nationalism and the patriotism of the working
classes, even of these groups who professed
socialism and identified with the social democratic
parties.
The gradual extension of the franchise and
the efforts of liberal states like Britain,
modernizing states like Germany, or survival
strategies of autocracies like Tsarist Russia to gain
legitimacy and popular support, produced a form
of patriotism. National pride and national
identification was also encouraged by overseas
expansion, by the material and psychological
rewards which imperial possessions brought to
countries like Britain, France, and even Holland
and Spain. In Britain a sense of national
identification was encouraged not only because
of the “peculiarities” of the English and the
glorious tradition of free born Englishmen, but
also because of pride in a worldwide empire.
The aggressive nationalism of the conservative
regimes in the late industrializing countries like
Germany helped to rally support for the regime
and to encourage nationalist sentiment
throughout Europe. The speech by the German
Emperor, William II, at Tangiers in Morocco in
1905, induced widespread fear in France, helped
to create a sense of national unity which was
able to transcend domestic conflicts in times of
acute crisis.
<br>
<br>
The period from 1890 to 1914 is often called
the period of armed “peace” based on the creation
of rival military and diplomatic alliances, between
contenders for industrial and military supremacy
and for colonial possessions and profits.
Nationalism in the period 1880-1914 was no
longer constrained by the ‘threshold principle’
which had limited the demands for nation states
earlier. Anybody of people claiming to be a nation
could claim the right to national selfdetermination.
The reasons for the increasing readiness of
real and imagined communities to make claims
of nationhood and national self-determination
was because of the pace of change, economic
distress and large scale migration of peoples in
this period. Traditional groups felt threatened by
the pace of modernization. Educated middle
strata with modest incomes- journalists, school
teachers and petty officials were the torchbearers
of linguistic nationalism. Migration produced
friction and conflicts between groups unused to
coexistence with different groups.
The oppressed nationalities of Eastern Europe
did become independent states based on Wilson’s
support for the principle of national selfdetermination but it is hardly possible to assert
that significant numbers had dreamed of both
social revolution and national independence.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Spread of nationalism</i></strong></div>

Britain can be said to be the first nation state
in modern sense as we identify the term ‘Nation’
today. Britain transformed its state and its politics
from the 1770s to 1830s. The Wilkes agitation of
1770s and the parliamentary reform of the 1830s
are the landmarks of these developments. From
1830, transformation of the state was marked by
a firm commitment to increasing intervention by
the state that led to the beginnings of a welfare
state and a system made to function by the state
according to the rules of the market. The
development of politics culminated in the outline
of a pluralist liberal democracy. In this, besides
all the agitation politics by different interest
groups, the working class played the most
important role, especially with the Chartist
movement of the 1840s. While Britain went
through modernization, it was remarkable for
having done so without a deliberate revolution
as in France.
<br>
<br>
Although the democratization of France took
place gradually, and the French Revolutions of
1830 and 1848 and the Paris Commune of 1871
are part of the gradual process of democratization
of French politics and society, the significance of
the radicalism of the years 1792-95 cannot be
denied.
Though, Napoleonic dictatorship was a
retreat from the ideals of the Revolution it is
equally true that his military exploits and
conquests simplified the political map of Europe
and spread the ideas of nationalism and
democracy among the conquered people. The
Congress of Vienna not only wished to contain
France but also, through the Metternich system,
the conservative European Powers – represented
by Prussia, Austria and Russia – sought to restrict
the spread of both democratic and nationalist
ideas.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Metternich system</i></strong></div>

In 1815, at the Congress of Vienna, the
protagonists of the old European order, inspired
by the Austrian Chancellor, Count Metternich,
tried to create a permanent barrier against
national and liberal movements. Popularly
known as the Metternich system, the origins of
this system of alliances can be traced from the
Holy Alliance, brought together by Tsar
Alexander I, and its rival, the Quadruple
Alliance, which was a British creation to
counteract the Tsar. These two different systems
of alliances set the stage for what came to be
known as the Congress system, which in the
period after 1815, envisaged a series of
international congresses of the great powers to
decide on European issues and problems. The
power structure of European states was
periodically reviewed after the Napoleonic wars
by the European great powers through the
mechanism known as the “Congress System”.
This was a periodic conference of the leaders of
the great powers in Europe to maintain the
balance of power between themselves starting
with the Congress of St. Petersburg in 1825.
Congress of Berlin in 1878 was a high point
which dealt with the consequences of the war
between the Russian and Ottoman Empires.
After 1818, following the Congress of Aix-laChappelle, there was a growing inclination
towards great power intervention in the domestic
politics of a country threatened by liberal
movements. e.g. in 1820, when a outbreak
occurred in Naples, the Powers conceded to
Metternich’s demand for intervention. At the
Congress of Laibach, 1821, Metternich was
allowed to intervene in Naples and Piedmont to
restore the absolutist regimes. This was the
greatest triumph of the Metternich system.
Even though the landed aristocracy and the
Church felt rejuvenated by the Restoration of
the traditional dynasties, it was still impossible
for the restored monarchies to ignore popular
political sentiments. These “strands” were
moderate constitutionalism, that would accept a
monarchy in a popular guise, radical
republicanism which verged on democracy, and
an inchoate egalitarianism that anticipated
socialist ideas of the future.
<br>
<br>
Between 1815 and 1848, the character of the
opposition to the restored regimes, however,
underwent a significant transformation. What
in the 1820’s, looked like an elitist, somewhat
conspiratorial opposition without any roots in a
larger society became linked by 1848, with a
range of popular political movements. In the
process, however, the opposition also became
divided. The main elements in the opposition
were the liberals who were tolerant about
monarchy but were keen to see absolutism
reformed into a constitutional monarchy.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Secret Society Movement</i></strong></div>

The secret society movement was a powerful
European phenomenon in early 19th century.
Everywhere, such secret conspiratorial formations
developed partly because of the restrictions on
organized politics imposed by the Restoration
regimes. Radical secret groups with their initiation
ceremonies, hierarchical chain of memberships,
secret symbols and codes were sometimes direct
offshoots of Masonic lodges.
Very often the secret societies represented the
more radical sections of a fairly widespread
liberal movement in Europe with the main
political objective of constitutional government.
In the larger European context, the secret society
activities of course became a part of the nascent
nationalist politics, the full implications of which
were realized during the 1830’s.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Turbulent 1820s and 1830s</i></strong></div>

Around the middle of the 1820s, a fresh bout
of the revolutionary fever came with the failed
Decembrist uprising in Russia and the relatively
successful Greek revolt. Decembrists attempted a
military coup de tat in December 1825 when the
death of the Czar provoked the uprising of the
soldiers in St. Petersburg. The Russian artillery
could easily disperse this uprising while a similar
action of a few days later in the Ukraine was
suppressed in the same manner. The leaders of
the uprising, including Colonel Pestel were hanged
and many more exiled to Siberia.
Russians succeeded in imposing the treaty of
Adrianople on Turkey by which Turkey agreed
to the autonomy of Serbia, the Danubian
principalities and Greece. Later in 1830, by the
Treaty of London, Greece’s complete
independence was recognized.
The result of all this was the complete collapse
of the Metternich system even though Austria
managed to retain its sphere of influence in Italy
and the Balkans. Despite his obsession with
legitimism, Metternich was unable to prevent a
European combination against the Turkish
Monarchy.
<br>
<br>
The July revolution in France was a brief and
quick affair. The restored monarchy failed to
defend itself against the popular combination of
liberal parliamentarians, the Parisian mob and
disgruntled soldiers. The provisional government
was established and on 30 July, the king’s cousin,
the Duke of Orleans was asked to take over as
the head of the state. In the first week of August,
a crown of the French people was offered to the
Duke of Orleans. In France, the 1830 revolution
was completed with the establishment of a
constitutional monarchy.
Radicals in Germany and Italy saw the
monarchial governments as obstacles to the
politics of integration; to them, their overthrow
was the precondition for a unified nation-state.
Radical nationalism in Italy found its greatest
exponent in Guiseppe Mazzini (1805-1872).
This was also the period when smaller, mostly
Slavic nationalities, of the Austrian empire in
the eastern reaches of the continent – the
Czeches, Slovaks, Croats, Slavs, Ukrainians and
Romanians – began to assert their identities as
nations by reviving their historical and folk
traditions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Age of Masses</i></strong></div>

In 1848 Europe made its cautious entry into
‘the age of the masses’. Political mobilizations
began to acquire a popular following in an
attempt to overcome the limitations of the politics
of secret societies that had dominated the
different phases of political unrest earlier in the
century. Economic distress certainly contributed
to this process of mobilization.
In 1845 the potato blight caused acute food
shortages, followed in 1846 by worse grain crop
in a several hot summer. The consequent steep
rise in the prices of foodstuffs resulted in food
riots in many places. Such distress was
aggravated by economic recession, which
produced urban unemployment.
<br>
<br>
The European revolts in 1848 began with the
Swiss Civil War in which the radically inclined
Protestant cantons were locked in a battle with
the conservative Catholic cantons. In this battle
the radical Protestant Cantons were ultimately
victorious as Metternich’s attempt to bail out the
conservative Catholic Cantons failed. The events
in Switzerland clearly demonstrated that the
defenders of the established order were incapable
of stopping the tide of the revolution.
Despite the revolutionary euphoria all over
Europe, and a significant move towards
parliamentary government, the revolution
ultimately “stopped at the foot of the throne”.
Except in France, in most parts of the continent,
monarchial government remained in place with
very little changes in even their administrative
structure.
<br>
<br>
From mid-1848, the revolution began to stage
its retreat. In a series of dramatic confrontations,
the revolutionary forces were overwhelmed.
Moderate factions within the liberal movement
worked out compromises with conservatives and
monarchists, and together played a crucial role
in suppressing the second round of revolutionary
insurgency in 1849.
The European revolts in 1848 despite focusing
on parliamentary government failed to change
much the character of monarchical government.
Even in France the revolutionary forces failed to
check the rise of Louis Napoleon’s dictatorship.
The process of centralization began in the
sixteenth century in both Britain and France but
in England the nation of national unity was more
advanced and continuous while in France it
remained only political unification till the coming
of French Revolution. Political debates provided
the theoretical structure of the French nationstate formation was continuous and the economic
integration was as much the product of state
direction as of the activity of business groups
and manufacturers.
<br>
<br>
The rise of the British nation-state was the
result of the English union with Wales, Scotland
and Ireland thereby creating a multi-national
state. The initial problem of separate identities
was greatly resolved by the process of capitalist
development and economic growth. However,
the French state had to become a vehicle of
capitalist development.
Separate class identities merged in the British
state though representative institutions like
parliament and political parties. In France the
class identities and class conflicts manifested itself
in the state and determined the nature of French
nation state which remained involved in social
issues.
Despite the systematic efforts to suppress
democracy in Europe the spread of liberal ideas
could not be held back indefinitely. The
revolution of 1848 which engulfed most of Europe
led to an accelerated movement towards
democracy and nationalism. It brought Napoleon
III to power in France, hastened the unification
of Germany and Italy and stirred national
sentiments in the multi-national Austrian empire.
New states like Greece, Belgium and Serbia
came up as a result of the revolutions of 1830
and 1848. After 1848, the Unification of Italy
and that of Germany were significant political
events and a total vindication of middle class
nationalism.
<br>
<br>
The simplification of the political map of
Europe by the reduction in the number of states
within the German Empire; the quickening of
the pulse of Spanish nationalism during the
military campaigns of the Peninsular War; and
the rise of Italian and German nationalism based
on the inspiration of the French armies, the
Napoleonic role in nation-state building and the
contagion of revolutionary and democratic ideas
helped to spread the gospel of nationalism in
Europe. It appealed to the intelligentsia and the
bourgeoisie which spearheaded the movement
for Italian and German unification. Mass politics
in the late 19th century was to give an additional
fillip to nationalism especially in Eastern Europe,
a region which was relatively backward
compared to the more industrialized parts of
Western Europe. Tilly observed, “The European
state-making process minimized the cultural
variation within states and maximized the
variation among states”.
<br>
<br>
Gerschenkron argued in his book Economic
Backwardness in Historical Perspective that in
countries like Germany and Russia which began
to industrialize later than Britain – the first
industrial nation – the role of the state was much
greater. To compensate for a late start the state
played an active role in creating appropriate
conditions for rapid industrialization by creating
a system of tariff protection and aiding a process
of cartelization of industry.
The doctrine of free trade liberal capitalism
as propounded by Britain was challenged by the
German economist Friedrich List to enable the
German economy to develop behind protectionist
walls and to catch up with Britain. The
businessmen and industrialists favoured political
unification because their self-interest as a class
was linked with the creation of a national marked
for German entrepreneurs. In Italy the weakness
of the bourgeoisie gave greater salience to the
role of the landlords and urban professionals in
the movement towards economic unification.
The study of nationalism in the small states
of Eastern Europe by Miroslav Hroch yielded the
notion of three phases in the development of
national movements. In the first stage or phase
A there was primarily an emphasis on culture,
literature and folklore; in phase B pioneers of the
national idea and its publicists occupied centrestage. It was only in the third stage – phase C –
that the national movements acquired mass
support on any significant scale.
It was only after the growth of a sense of
cultural nationalism based on a sense of language,
culture and history that nationalism as an idea
influenced the smaller nationalities of Eastern
Europe. The break-up of the Hapsburg Empire
of Austria-Hungary led to the creation of new
nation states of Czechoslovakia, Romania and
Yugoslavia. In most cases the nationalist idea
preceded the growth of the nation-state. The
democratization of polity in Europe helped the
popular mobilizations around the issues like
language and empire-building which
strengthened the feeling of nationalism among
people. The modern states also played crucial
role in giving shape to nationalist feelings and
forging the nation-states. In Eastern Europe,
except Russia, the cultural issues proved to be
more important in giving rise to national
sentiments.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Gellner and Typology of Nationalism</i></strong></div>

Gellner, writing exclusively about Europe,
divided Europe into four zones travelling from
west to east and formulated four different types
of nationalism applicable to each zone. Gellner
understood nationalism in terms of a marriage
between the states and a pervasive high-culture
and saw four different patterns of this marriage
in the four European zones. Zone I, located on
the western belt consisting of England, France,
Portugal and Spain witnessed a rather smooth
and easy marriage of the two, because both the
ingredients (state and high-culture for the defined
territory) were present prior to the arrival of
nationalism.
<br>
<br>
Zone II (present day Italy and Germany),
situated on the territory of the erstwhile Holy
Roman Empire, was different from zone 1 in the
sense that the bride (high culture for the territory)
was ready (among the Italians from the days of
early Renaissance and among the Germans since
the days of Luther) but there was no groom (state
for the exclusive territory).
Here also, as in zone I, nationalism was
benign, soft and relatively conflict-free. There
were no claims and counter-claims for the
territory. Culturally homogeneous territories did
not have to be carved out; they already existed.
The high-culture also existed; it only needed to
reach out to peasants and workers.
It is in zone III (territories east of Germany
and west of Russian Empire, areas of present
day Poland, Ukrane, Yugoslavia, Greece, Albania,
Balkans etc.) that nationalism ceased to be benign
and liberal and had to necessarily be nasty,
violent and brutal. The horrors, generally
associated with nationalism, were inevitable here
as neither of the two preconditions (state and
high-culture) existed in congruent fashion. Both
a national state and a national culture had to be
carved out. The nationalist imperative was kept
ruthlessly under check by the Tsarist Empire, the
marriage of state and culture followed the
disintegration without causing it in any way.
Nationalism and Indian Experience
Essence of Indian nationalism was rebellion
against the state. Indian people acquired a
modern state in the form of British imperialist
state for the entire territory, but refused to live
under it. The bulldozer of industrialization was
not operative in India. The pre-existing
socio religious identities were therefore not
flattened out.
<br>
<br>
India experienced four different kinds of
nationalism. The major Indian nationalism was
territorial, anti-colonial and led to the creation
of a nation-state through a national movement.
It acquired not only one but three distinct
high-cultures during the colonial period. Indian
National movement remained, throughout its life,
linguistically and culturally remarkably plural.
Since cultural unity is the hallmark of all
nationalist projects, Indian national movement
evolved the unique slogan of ‘unity in diversity’
and remained committed to both. Paradoxically
the plural and non-coercive elements of the
Indian national movement became its greatest
strength and weakness at the same time.
The focus on cultural and linguistic plurality
enabled the movement to maximized
mobilization, but it also rendered Indian
nationalism somewhat handicapped when
confronted with a rival nationalism. The second
major nationalism was a rival to Indian
nationalism. This led to the creation of Pakistan.
Pakistani nationalism was based on the famous
two-nation theory, which implied that Indian
Muslims were not a part of an Indian nation but
were a nation in themselves.
Pakistani nationalism was strangely based on
religious unity and territorial disunity. The east
and the west wing of the new nation-state were
separated from each other by over 900 miles.
The new state took religious unity for granted
and imposed linguistic and cultural unity without
being able to achieve economic parity.
The result was the emergence of a breakaway
nationalism in 1971. The fourth category is that
of aspirant nationalism- forces for Khalistan in
Punjab, Azad Kashmir in the state of Jammu
and Kashmir and the Tamil demand for a
separate state in Sri Lanka. These may be called
potential nationalisms. The experience of potential
nationalism (or nationalism which are not likely
to ever culminate in the formation of new nationstates) is not specific to India but is a 
worldwide phenomenon.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Modern State</i></strong></div>

In the 1750s, Britian’s political, social and
economic life was dominated by the landed
aristocracy and agriculture was the basis of the
economy. Government had little active role in
the lives of the people. But by the 1760s Britain
became the first nation which brought about
significant changes in her polity, society and
economy, thus beginning the process of
industrialization. New shades of political
ideologies developed in Britain and became
modern through a liberal and democratic
transformation. Britain’s rising middle class and
ruling aristocracy through reforms managed to
restrict the working class movements within the
broader framework of parliamentary politics.
Politics refers to the struggle for power. Those
who have power try to maintain it while those
who are out of power may resist or try to capture
it. In a sense, this tussle pervades all forms of
social relations and institutions. Secondly,
ideological conflicts also play a significant role in
the politics which centres around the state.
The rulers may seek to justify the existing
system in terms of religious or secular ideals while
those out of power may look forward to changes
which may be radically new or reactionary in
their aims. In general terms, such political
impulses may be described as centrist, leftist and
rightist respectively. But their content can vary
according to context. And, it may be useful to
view them as relative positions only.
<br>
<br>
In modern times, however, the notion of the
‘left’ has been associated more with egalitarian
movements of/for the working classes while
centrist politics has been mostly ascribed to the
bourgeoisie which champion individual rights but
not social equality. ‘Rightist’ politics has further
assumed various forms in recent times ranging
from different types of revivalist movements to
secular dictatorships and fascist states.
Political changes that occurred from 18th
century onwards can be traced to the experiences
in British Polity. Reason being that Britain was
one of most important originating place of most
far reaching changes in economic, social and
political sphere. One should note that most of
modern democratic procedural instruments were
invented, practiced and sharpened over a
considerable period of time and today are taken
as granted. A study of British polity will make
one realize the importance of these procedural
instruments.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Changes in British Polity</i></strong></div>

In Britain, after the revolutions of the
seventeenth century, the lower house (House of
Commons) managed to introduce some important
checks on the monarch’s political powers and
acquired a crucial role in governance. For
example, the crown’s finances, including its right
to raise fresh taxes and spend on all state
departments were controlled by the House of
Commons through the mandatory annual
budget. Similarly, all new laws had to be passed
by parliament first and only then sent for royal
assent.
<br>
<br>
The Monarch who was in practice compelled
to appoint his ministers largely from those who
had a following in the House of Commons. This
significant convention opened the path to the
future development of the modern ‘cabinet
system’ in which the council of ministers is held
collectively responsible to parliament and holds
office as long as it can command a majority in
the House of Commons.
The Whigs and the Tories were the principal
political groupings in British parliament since the
Glorious Revolution of 1688. The Tories were
political conservatives and firmly geared towards
the ruling Anglican aristocracy while the Whigs
supported the organized body of religious dissent
in England as well as Scotland and were more
open to middle class demands for greater political
equality and freedom.
<br>
<br>
Still, the electoral base of the Commons itself
was extremely limited and the landed interest
dominated both the houses. Some large centres
like Westminster had several thousand voters
while a few ghost towns like Old Sarum had as
few as seven. Narrow social base of parliament
was actually defended by most ideologues of the
eighteen century. Even reformers such as
Edmund Burke had considerable contempt for
the poor and feared any mass action instead of
viewing it as a resource for reform efforts.
While it is apparent that representative
institutions played a unique role in Britain both
at the central and local levels in fixing taxes and
regulating state expenditure as well as poor relief,
it is also worth remembering that the dominance
of the landed aristocracy at all levels. At the top,
there was powerful group of some 350 families
who owned huge landed estates, usually with
titles of nobility.
Below this exclusive group of peers or nobles
in Britain’s ruling elite, came the 4000 odd
families constituting the gentry. They were again
owners of substantial landed estates. A few
amongst them had wealth comparable to those
of the lords but their title was that of a knight or
a baron and the offices they generally aspired to
were those of the unpaid Justices of Peace or a
seat in the House of Commons. Another feature
of the British aristocracy was its fairly compact
character.
<br>
<br>
Parliamentary checks on the executive’s right
to impose new taxes, the sanctity of private
property, the independent tradition of the English
common law and the force of legal provisions
such as Habeus Corpus along with a relatively
free press guaranteed some important rights to
the upper and middle classes in Britain as a time
when similar liberties were unknown elsewhere.
At the same time it is important to remember
that these freedoms could be enjoyed in practice
only by the wealthy who could take recourse to
the lengthy procedures of law.
Demand for Reforms
Britain had tradition of liberal thought going
back to the revolutionary decades when
philosophers such as John Locke espoused a new
theory of state bound to safeguard persons and
property. The controversies generated centering
on the freedom of press and protection against
arbitrary arrest during 1760s and 1770s brought
the issues of civic rights to the fore to British
politics. The arrogance of George III, who ruled
Britain from 1760 to 1820, the fight for liberal
rights led during his rule by leaders such as Fox
and Wilkes, and the issues raised by the liberation
of British colonies in America after 1776 further
stoked the embers of such discontent.
The most important concern of the liberal
agenda was of high taxation and waste in public
expenditure. The parliament as well as the press
were important fora through which the demand
for the ‘economical reforms’ against these ills was
raised. In 1779, influential sections of the gentry
led by Wywill gave further support to such
demands. Consequently, Conservative leaders
such as Edmund Burke as well as liberals such
as Pitt the Younger embarked upon a series of
reforms which led to the abolition of crown
patronage and the introduction of modern
budgeting in Britain.
<br>
<br>
The Doctrine of ‘utilitarianism’, was coined
by influential thinker Jeremy Bentham. According
to this doctrine all laws and institutions of society
were to be judged on the basis of their utility to
the maximum number and not by their traditional
sanctity or textual authority.
Others causes of public concern during this
period were: the issues of public health and
education, crime and morality, the treatment of
prisoners, condition of the poor in sprawling
industrial slums and the rights of dissenting
religious groups. The demand for electoral and
parliamentary reforms was also gaining
momentum amongst sections of the middle class
as well as artisans and working classes. The
writings of radicals like Tom Paine and Major
Cartwright acted as powerful catalysts in this
respect.
The outbreak of the French Revolution in
1789 also had a positive impact on the radical
movement in Britain. During this period, the
British state not only used nationalist sentiment
to buttress its authority but also unleashed
unprecedented repression against the radicals as
well as the nascent working class movement. This
included the suspension of the Habeus Corpus
in 1794, the introduction of anti-combination
laws in 1799 as also a series of treason trials and
bloody suppression of all radical organizations.
Meanwhile the working class movement was
also maturing in Britain. The initial phase of
industrialization was full of misery for the
proletariat which worked and lived in extremely
hostile conditions for long hours on meager wages
and with few rights or social security. It is hardly
surprising that in the face of these brutal
conditions, in several places, the workers
responded by systematically breaking the
machines which symbolized the new order to
them. These early machine breakers have been
nicknamed Luddites after their mythical leader
Nedd Ludd. Socialists such as Robert Owen
(1771-1858) further argued that all wealth is
created through labour and therefore the laboring
classes should claim the full fruit of their work.
Owen himself emphasized workers’ cooperative
and self help rather than a direct confrontation
with the state.
<br>
<br>
Most brutal state action was visible in 1819
at Peterloo Park, in Manchester, where a crowd
of 60,000 had gathered to listen to Orator Hunt
on Democratic reforms. It was indiscriminately fired at. Eleven persons lost their
lives and more than four hundred were
injured in this bloodbath. Peterloo has been
remembered as the domestic Waterloo of the old
guard which became panicky and passed the
infamous Six Acts putting fresh restrictions on
the press and political assemblies etc.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reform Act</i></strong></div>

The passage of the Parliamentary Reform Act
of 1832 was one of the most crucial events in
Britain’s transition to modern politics as it ensured
a prominent place to the rising middle classes in
British polity and a stake in its stability. However,
aim of the Act was to preserve the existing
Constitution of Britain; not to change it. It tried
to introduce some reforms in the election of the
House of Commons. While providing for a
redistribution of 143 seats of the lower House to
accord with the new demographic pattern of
industrial Britain, the Act also abolished a
number of ‘rotten’ boroughs (parliamentary
constituencies with few members) and extended
the franchise marginally. The few electorates still
consisted of less than six lakh men or a mere 3%
of the total population of Britain then.
Thus, the Act ensured that the rule of
property would continue in Britain. But, alongside
the established aristocracy, it granted
representation to the rising middle classes in the
country’s parliamentary government. This went
a long way towards forging a compromise
between the bourgeoisie and the landed elite,
thus enabling a peaceful transition to a modern
liberal polity in Britain.
<br>
<br>
First, the very manner of its passage
enhanced the significance of the House of
Commons in relation to the upper House and
also set an important precedent of extra
parliamentary pressure on legislators. Second, the
reformist agenda within parliament became
extremely strong after 1832 as more radicals
entered parliament from the industrial centers
which had gained representation.
The emergence of modern political parties
geared for electoral competition and the
mobilization of public opinion also had an
important bearing on politics. Liberal polity
matured. e.g. resolution of corn controversy.
The Corn Laws had been passed in 1815 to
ensure good returns to the landed classes of
Britain on their staple produce with the help of
high tariffs on cheaper grain coming from
overseas. This was hurting the interest of all who
had to purchase grain from the market, including
the workers and the middle classes. The
industrialists also viewed them as a serious
burden since they compelled them to pay higher
subsistence wages to workers. In 1839, the middle
classes, led by Richard Cobden, founded the AntiCorn Law League and launched a nation-wide
campaign for the abolition of the hated laws.
The campaign was a remarkable illustration of a
political movement employing modern means of
propaganda for a well defined objective to be
achieved through parliamentary legislation. The
abolition of the laws was actually carried out,
not by a liberal, but by a pro-landlord Tory
government in 1846. This again established the
spirit of accommodation.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Emergence of Modern state</i></strong></div>

Britain was among the first countries to
emerge as a nation-state in the early modern
period. Under the Tudors and Hanoverian
dynasty, it acquired political stability (cessation
of wars amongst feudal factions, a strong defence
against external invasions and pride regarding
its ‘mixed constitution’). The relative decline of
widespread political violence, whether in the form
of factional wars within the ruling classes, large
scale popular disturbances, or brutal state
suppression (or even organized crime) in the
century after the Glorious Revolution of 1688,
was a significant feature of the British polity.
This was accompanied by the growth of the
sovereign authority of the ‘King in Parliament’
and the subjugation of church, lords and
autonomous communities within Britain. The
growth of a nationalist identity amongst its
citizens (outside Ireland) was of great significance.
Various measures were also required to
establish a ‘free market’ (another major concern
of an emerging modern state). It began with a
series of abolitions from the closing years of
eighteenth century, of price and wage controls,
of state-supported monopolies, and of subsidies
and restrictions on business. It also demanded
the unification of the internal market and the
tariff reforms of 1786 and 1820s culminating in
the abolition of the Corn Laws in 1846. The New
Poor Law of 1834 played a critical role in
establishing a free labour by making conditions
for local welfare for the poor very strict.
The beginning of a public education system
was made with the Act of 1833 when grants-inaid and school inspection were also started. But
disputes between religious groups slowed the pace
of change on this major issue. Similarly, a public
health policy evolved after Chadwick’s energetic
but controversial efforts at enforcing sanitation
schemes through the Public Health Board
established in 1848. The development of public
utilities were assigned to local bodies by the
Municipal Reform Act of 1835 but it gathered
momentum only from the late nineteenth century
when ‘gas and water socialism’ was championed
by leaders like Chamberlain.
<br>
<br>
Early industrial state was slow to grant even
basic workers’ rights to form unions or to strike
peacefully. The Anti-Combination Act against
unionization was passed in 1799 and early labour
movements were suppressed violently. The
existing system of poor relief was also considered
wasteful and scaled down by the New Poor Law
of 1834. The growing misery of the proletariat
and pressures from humanitarian groups and
the labour movement itself forced the state to
take limited ameliorative measures subsequently.
The anti-combination laws were repealed in 1834.
The first Factory Act was passed in 1833 only to
provide some protection to children under the
pressure of the Evangelicals (one of the reforming
religious groups). Further reforms came in small
doses, e.g. Mines Act (1842), Ten hours working
day (1847), legalization of union (1870's) and of
peaceful picketing (1876).
<br>
<br>
Apart from labour, other social groups which
demanded reforms were religious minorities and
women. Despite the advocacy of women’s rights
by Mary Wollstonecraft and some liberals like
John Stuart Mill, female franchise was conceded
only after the First World War.
Working class and Chartist movement
There were radical movements led jointly by
artisans and some middle class activists at the
turn of the nineteenth century. The British state
adopted repressive measures against them which
culminated in the Peterloo massacre of 1819. The
first attempts to link all laboring men together in
general trade union and also to forge unity for a
General Strike acquired momentum during the
1820s and 30s. In 1834, the Grand National
confederation of Trade Unions or the GNCTU
was formed to give concrete shape to a broad
working class movement to demand better wages
and working conditions, including a ten hour
working day. Some of the members also looked
forward to an Owenite millennium in which
workers would enjoy the full product of their
labour by organizing industries under their own
cooperatives.
State also swung into action and widespread
arrests were ordered against all unions. For
example, the Friendly Society of Agricultural
Workers was disbanded and six of its organizers
convicted for seven years transportation simply
on the ground of ‘taking secret oaths’. These
became famous as the Tolpuddle martyrs and
only after a prolonged agitation by workers they
were repatriated in 1839. Workers were badly
hit all over Britain. Some working class leaders
were beginning to question the Owenite stress
on self help and cooperatives and demanding
political rights for workers instead.
In 1836, the London Working Men’s
Association was founded by men like Lovett to
demand universal suffrage. Radicals like William
Morris and Smith O’ Brien also called for a new
awakening amongst workers.
<br>
<br>
The Chartist Movement was the most
significant outcome of the growing focus on
political power which the British workers evinced
in 1830s and 40s. It derives its name from the six
point Charter, it presented before the parliament
demanding universal manhood suffrage, secret
ballot, annual parliaments, equal electoral
districts, abolition of property qualification for
the members of House of Commons and payment
of regular salaries to them. In 1839, the first
Chartist Convention met in London but despite
the collection of a million signatures for its
petition it was rejected outright by the parliament.
Economic recovery of the mid forties again
turned the attention of most workers away from
radical politics and towards wage improvement
through trade union activity. The last flicker of
Chartism glew again in 1848-which was the year
of revolutions all over Europe. A demonstration
of five lakh Chartists was called at Kennington
commons in the heart of London to present a
mammoth petition of six million signatures to
the parliament.
Overall, in Britain, Liberal rather than
revolutionary politics remained the preponderant
concern of workers. The growth of the Labour
Party committed to parliamentary politics at the
turn of the present century further ensured this
pattern. Term ‘labour aristocracy’ is used to refer
to men whose specialized skills in the expanding
industrial economy coupled with the growing
benefits of Britain’s large empire enabled them
to maintain a comfortable standard of living. As
a result, the ‘labour aristocracy’ put faith in
‘improvement’ within the Capitalist order rather
than its overthrow.
<br>
<br>
Reform Act of 1867 which granted voting
right for urban workers was a product not of a
radical mass movement but of party politics. The
urban working class was further accommodated
within the liberal polity with further enactments
to recognize their right to form trade unions
(1870) and to go on strike (1876).
The principal factors which led to such a
political resolution in the first industrial nation
were: the unity displayed by its upper classes
vis-à-vis workers, the economic benefits of the
expanding British Empire, the relative weakness
of revolutionary politics in nineteenth century
Britain and the subsequent growth of welfare
legislation in the country.
