<h3>Unification of Italy and Germany</h3>


Italy and Germany are two important
examples of how language, folk culture and
common historical memories led to very strong
nationalistic feelings helping to build the two
people into sovereign, united and independent
nations states by 1870.
<br>
<br>
Both Germany and Italy emerged as nationstates in the 19th century. Although the idea of
nationalism in some form or other can be traced
back in time in both cases, the actual
development of nation-states took place only in
the 19th century. The process of unification was
different in the case of Germany from that of
Italy. While in Germany the economic and
political unity was achieved at a much higher
level, in Italy the unification was achieved mainly
at the political and cultural levels. The economic
unity in Italy was much weaker in comparison.
In Germany, the unity was brought about mainly
from above. But in Italy, the popular
mobilizations also played an important role. Apart
from these factors, wars also provided the
impetus which brought the people together and
helped in forging the respective nations.
Increasing importance of language as a factor
in the emergence of nationality conflicts in the
late 19th century was of special significance in
unification of Germany and Italy. Language
became an issue in international politics with
the dispute between the Danes and the Germans
and over Schleswig-Holstein and of the Germans
and French over the Rhine frontier during the
1840s. The history of German and Italian
nationalism can be said to be a struggle to unite
German and Italian speaking people within a
single nation state. The protagonists were Prussia
and Piedmont-Sardinia which forged national
unity by skillful diplomacy and warfare on the
one hand and pragmatic handling of popular
national sentiments and occasional revolutionary
upsurges.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Idea of A German Nationality</i></strong></div>

The impetus to the idea of a German Nation
was provided by the French Revolution and the
Simplification of the political map of Europe and
of the German states by the destruction of the
Holy Roman Empire by Napoleonic armies.
During the early Middle-Ages various Germanic
tribes and Celts and Slavs were fused by a
process of conflict and assimilation into the
German people. Even when the German races
felt bound to each other by ties of blood – the
Saxons, Franks, Bavarians and Swabians – they
did not have the consciousness of being German.
The connection between Lutheranism and the
rise of German nationalism was slight since their
struggle was primarily against the Antichrist in
Rome and not limited to national issues. The
Protestant translations of the Bible into the
German vernacular led to the growth of modern
German but the growth of German nationalism
actually took place with the rise of German
Romanticism.
<br>
<br>
The Renaissance and Reformation in
Germany were primarily scholarly and
theological events and so these movements failed
to destroy the medieval idea of World Empire or
to change politics and society as in the West
European countries. German nationalism like that
of the Russians became preoccupied with the
“soul” or “mission” of the nation since it was
not rooted in social and political reality and
constituted “a venture in education and
propaganda rather than in policy shaping and
government”. Still, one can say that Martin
Luther’s rejection of the authority of the Pope
and translation of the Bible into German created
the basis for a national consciousness.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political and Economic Background</i></strong></div>

At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the
political fragmentation of Germany was partially
overcome by the reduction in the number of
sovereign German states to thirty-eight from the
three hundred states of the Holy Roman Empire
which was abolished. The German Bund was
created in 1815 in order to preserve “the
independence and sovereignty of the individual
German states”. The concert of Europe, created
after the Congress of Vienna, was a system
designed by the conservative monarchies of
Austria, Prussia and Russia to check to spread
of democratic idea in Europe.
Very limited powers were granted to the
representative institutions introduced after 1815
in the German states. While after 1848 most
German states introduced democratic reforms,
in Prussia the pace of reforms was slower since
electoral votes were allocated equally to three
groups of income-tax payers, the divisions being
made on the basis of income tax revenue
payments. Prussian system of representation
remained in force until 1918 and constituted an
important basis for the perpetuation of a
backward political system.
<br>
<br>
The defeat of Austria in the Austro-Prussian
War of 1866 led to the creation of the North
German Confederation. The defeat of France in
the Franco-German War of 1870-71 led to the
creation of the Imperial German government. A
national parliament elected on the basis of adult
franchise – the Reichstag – and representatives
of the 25 German states in the Federal Council
or Bundesrat were to shape the policy of Imperial
Germany. The Prussian king became the German
Emperor with control over the German armed
forces and the Reich Chancellor was also
Prussian. However, the Imperial Reich was not
a unified state like that of Britain or a centralized
state like that of Frances. In the Federal Council
or Bundesrat the Prussians controlled a plurality
but not a majority of votes since concessions had
to be made to Bavaria and Wurttemberg to entice
them into the Imperial Reich.
The process of German national unification
was shaped by Prussian conservatism and
militarism but the process of centralization under
the Imperial Reich was affected by local and
centrifugal forces.
<br>
<br>
In Prussia public industrial and technical
schools after 1820 encouraged industry for
national political reasons. Liberal entrepreneurs
linked the issue of industry for the fatherland to
expectations of political unity before 1848. The
engineering associations of the 1850s and 1860s
carried these ideal further. Camphausen, Siemens,
Hansemann, List and Harkort were German
entrepreneurs who believed that they were also
part of “a national civilizing mission”.
Dahrendorf has argued that Germany
developed into an industrial but not a capitalist
society. The presence of a sizable Mittelstand or
intermediate stratum of small producers is
evidence of incomplete modernization. The
German nation state, unlike the French, was not
founded on the basis of liberal democratic ideas
and the weakness of the German liberal
bourgeoisie is largely responsible for this.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Unification</i></strong></div>

The process of German unification during the
19th century was speeded up by the creation of
a national market, a network of railways and
communications and a self-conscious bourgeoisie.
Unification was achieved by an alliance of liberal
bourgeoisie with the landowning class in which
war and diplomacy played a vital role.
The German Bund or Confederation of 1815,
with all its deficiencies, served as a preordained
and legitimate theatre of operations till 1867 for
nationalist forces in Germany. In 1815 East Prussia
and Schlewig were not a part of the German
Confederation while Bohemia and Moravia,
predominantly Czech area, were included. The
Czech liberals refused to take part in the elections
to the German Assembly in 1848.
The German National Assembly in 1848 was
created on the basis of the most substantial and
widespread upsurge in Germany in the 19th
century. Briefly the Frankfurt Parliament of 1848
indicated the possibility of a democratic and
untied Germany. But it had limited success,
evident by the fact that even in 1849 the National
Assembly opted for a Kleindeutsches Reich or
Little Germany.
<br>
<br>
Rivalry of the two major dynastic powers in
Germany eventually led to the Austro-Prussian
War of 1866 which ended in Austrian exclusion
from the German nation. In 1863 the issue of
German claims over the Duchies of SchleswigHolstein, an important issue in 1848, were
revived and once these duchies were taken from
Denmark, it was not difficult to pick a quarrel
with Austria over tenure. In the Austro-Prussian
war although the Austrians secured a victory at
Custozza they were decisively defeated at
Koniggratz. In so far as the creation of the North
German Confederation in 1867 menaced the
power or security of France, it has been rightly
remarked that it was France rather than Austria
which was defeated at Koniggratz.
In July 1863 the Austrian Emperor Francis
Joseph convened a meeting of all the German
Princes at Frankfurt to discuss a scheme for
Federal reform, by which the reconstituted central
authority was to be placed permanently in the
hands of Austria and of her allies, the secondary
states. Prussia’s absence (which was the result of
strong advice by Bismarck to King of Prussia)
made the Austrian proposal unworkable.
Austria’s policy of trying to overthrow the
Zollverein by using the resentment of the south
German secondary states against Prussia’s liberal
customs policy also failed to yield results. Despite
political sympathies with Bavaria and Austria
Saxony remained within the Zollverein. The
south German secondary states were compelled
to accept the Prussian customs policy since they
were unwilling to join a tariff union with Austria
without the north German states.
<br>
<br>
Bismarck’s skill lay in securing a favourable
international situation before the waged war with
Austria in 1866. Also considerable statesmanship
was involved in the manner of handling the small
German states after Prussian victory in 1866 and
in the creation of the North German
Confederation in 1867. The fear of France also
encouraged the small south German states to
attach themselves to Prussia.
The failure to create a Southern Confederation
indicated that the southern states would
eventually join Bismarck’s North German
Confederation. The conflict with France in 1870
led to military victories which in turn led to the
creation of the German Empire. The four southern
states, Bavara, Wurtemberg, Baden and Hesse
joined the German Empire in 1871.
In short the whole process is summarized as
follows; Under Bismarck, Prussia went to war
with Austria and forced Austria to surrender
some areas. He also made peace with South
German states. Austria withdrew from any
involvement with the German Confederation.
Prussia also went to war with France in 1869
when France tried to secure Luxembourg and
Belgium and opposed Prussia’s support for a
Hohenzollern candidate for the Spanish throne.
This war led to a new nationalist wave sweeping
through the South German states as well. This
helped in the process of unification. The war
ended with the treaty of Frankfurt in February
1871 by which Alsace Lorraine was ceded
perpetually to Germany and France also had to
pay an indemnity of 5 billion francs.
Bismarck showed a remarkable ingenuity in
manipulating democratic institutions and
principles for galvanizing popular support for
the monarchical order in the newly established
German empire after 1871. In a way this political
strategy, described as Bismarckism, was the
German variant of Bonapartism which
throughout the imperial era remained a principal
watchword of the German ruling classes.
<br>
<br>
Illiberal Shift in Late 19th Century
Towards the late 19th century there was an
illiberal or right wing shift in the nature of
nationalist politics. The reason for this growth in
right wing orientation of nationalism was the
fear of popular participation in politics, especially
by the working class and the left wing or socialist
parties. The liberal intelligentsia and middle class,
which had championed a republican or liberal
nationalism in the first half of the 19th century
made a compromise with the conservative
landowners and dynastic states after the defeat
of the revolutions of 1848. In Italy the relation
between the national movement for political
unification and popular participation was so
weak that Massimo d’ Azeglio observed: “we
have made Italy, now we have to make Italians”.
It was the revolution of 1848 that revealed
the weakness of the liberal bourgeoisies in Europe.
In Germany and France, middle classes were
willing to side with conservative Prussia or the
Emperor of the French, Napoleon III, rather than
accept a greater pace of change. In Germany,
during the years 1870-1878 the anti-clerical
element in bourgeois nationalism prepared the
basis of the conflict with the Social Democratic
party and movement after 1878. The new rightwing nationalism which emerged in the late
1870s was hostile to left-wing liberals as well as
Social Democrats.
<br>
<br>
The weakness of liberal democratic
movements in 19th century Germany certainly
led to the growth of right wing nationalism and
the containment of Socialist Democracy.
Successful overseas expansion was supported by
the right wing to secure economic benefits which
would not only benefit businessmen, and middle
class colonial officials, but also the industrial
working class, at least in the export industries.
The German right-wing was able to forge an
alliance of landowners, industrialists and middle
class to hold in check the growth of the liberal
middle class, workers and socialism.
An authoritarian government legitimized by
popular support had to take recourse to imperial
expansion as a measure aiming at domestic
political stability. The man who successfully
outlined the basic framework of this policy was
Otto von Bismarck who became the MinisterPresident of Prussia in 1863 and subsequently
held the position of Imperial Chancellor after
the unified German state came into being in 1871.
In fact in 1863 Bismarck was summoned from
his estate in East Prussia by a besieged Prussian
monarchy to solve the political and constitutional
crisis caused by the rift between the liberal
majority in the Prussian parliament (Landtag)
and the government over the extremely
contentious issue of army expansion.
The confrontation first took shape in 1860
when a new law was laid before the Landtag
for financial approval of the war ministry's plans
of army expansion. The liberal majority saw this
as a step towards the further militarization of
society. They feared that the expansion of the
regular army at the expense of the citizen's militia
would become a weapon of repression in the
hands of Prussians despotism. In such situation
Bismarck, appointed as PM ruled without
parliamentary approval of budget. Prussian
victory in the battle of Sadowa (between Prussia
and Austria in 1866) fulfilled the liberal dream
of national integration under Bismarck's
leadership, the Prussian liberals were even
agreeable to giving retroactive sanction to
Bismarck's budget less regime of the early 1860's
by condoning the excesses of the great leader
who was increasingly looked upon as a white
revolutionary in liberal circles.
<br>
<br>
The compromise that was finally reached
between Bismarck and his liberal critics
determined the character of the German Empire.
The governmental system was basically an
extension of the Prussian system in which the
privileges and power of the military aristocracy
remained insulated from popular intervention.
The success of this Bismarckian strategy of
rallying parliamentary support for the
conservative through electoral manipulations
ultimately depended on his skill 'for running
internal politics on the steam power of foreign
affairs. National prestige was one consideration
which could turn critics into supporters. This
strategy remained unchanged even after
Bismarck's rule came to an end in 1890.
The inevitable consequence of this strategy
was a certain kind of ultra nationalist popular
mobilization along racist lines anticipating in a
way the basic features of Fascist mobilization of
the early twentieth century. The phenomenon of
the charismatic leader which was an important
feature of Bonapartism continued to inform
Fascist mobilization at a later date.
In Nazi Germany, the Fuehrer (title used by
Hitler) demanded complete obedience and
surrender to the leader. In addition much of the
racist ideologies in the Nazi movement were
derived from the racial theories that the German
ruling classes had earlier deployed (in the late
19th century) to bolster the extremist nationalist
sentiments. Central to this racist and ultranationalist mentality was Social Darwinism
which transferred to the human sphere the
biological theories of natural selection and an
equally volatile notion of, 'survival of the fittest'.
The whole argument implied that competition
between different nations for achieving
dominance in the world is endemic in which
only the strongest will survive. The theory fitted
in well with the imperial ambitions of the
German state. Pan German league popularized
the notion of Germanisation of Europe,
particularly the continent's eastern reaches
inhabited by 'inferior Slavonic people'. Civilising
them was looked upon as the great mission of
the Teutonic (Anglo-Saxon, Dutch, German and
Scandinavian) race.
<br>
<br>
The anti-Semitic ideology, which was
substantially reinforced by the activities of the
Pan German league since the 1890's reached a
bloody climax in Nazi Germany.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ITALY</i></strong></div>

The idea of Italy as an entity, of Italian as a
noble and beautiful language and of the common
cultural roots of the Italian city and states,
however, can be traced back to the Renaissance
period and even earlier. Francisco Petrarch (1304-
1374) turned to antiquity for inspiration and
solace following the decline of the two great
forces of universalism – the Holy Roman Empire
and the Papacy. It was a purely literary
patriotism. Rienzo’s “proclamations of the
sovereignty of the Roman people and of the unity
of Italy”, and his support for the common people
against the aristocracy, also contained weak
anticipations of ideas of nationalism and
democracy.
<br>
<br>
The campaign for a unified literacy vernacular
started in Italy when it became the victim of
invading armies. But the debate on language
reflected the social divisions in Italy and not
merely regional differences. The insistence on the
linguistic cleavage between the ruling class and
the common people and the assumption that Italy
could have one language only for the dominant
social groups reflected a profoundly elitist
attitude.
In Italy poets played a major role in the
development of nationalism. It was humanistic
literary elite which played a role in the diffusion
of the Italian language. There was no powerful
state as in France which could promote the
national language. The absence of a vernacular
reformation as in Germany confined the Italian
language to tiny elite of 2.5% who commonly
used the Italian language even in 1860.
In fact the great contributions of Italian
humanism also reflected a bias in favour of the
elite. The great Italian humanists “spoke for and
to the dominant social groups”. The literary
output of the humanists was rooted in a sense of
the responsibilities of the upper classes. Even the
Renaissance ideal of the dignity of man was
linked to the domineering position of urban ruling
groups in an age of triumph. Italian nationalism
of the 19th century failed to overcome the
cultural elitism of the Italian humanists and
literary masters.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Political and Economic Background</i></strong></div>

During the first half of the 16th century, Italy
faced an intermittent conflict between French,
Swiss, Spanish and German soldiers for political
supremacy on Italian states – Venice, Milan,
Florence, Naples and the Papal states – produced
by, mid-15th century – was upset by the Italian
wars of 1494-1559. While France and Spain
began to move towards a sense of nationalism,
the Italians had a strong sense of regional or
local attachment to Milan, Florence or Genoa;
but they could also swing to the other extreme
to become cosmopolitans.
It was the French Revolution which provided
a model for Italian nationalism. The French
occupying forces in Lombardy organized an essay
competition on the subject of the best form of
free government for Italy. This encouraged a
debate extolling the ancient glories of Italy,
admiration for France and its constitution of 1795
and schemes for Italian regeneration and
unification. Melchiorre Gioia won the essay
competition and become one of Italy’s leading
economists.
<br>
<br>
The Kingdom of Italy created by Napoleon
helped to foster Italian national sentiment but it
also reduced it to a continental colony of France.
The Napoleonic legal codes and prefectural
system which was introduced in Italy helped to
define the model of a unified national state. Even
the Italian army, based on conscription and used
for Napoleon’s campaigns, revealed a sense of
nationalism. It was as a reaction to French
domination and Napoleon’s identification with
Imperial Rome that Italian writers choose to reject
the Roman heritage.
The Austrians were the dominant power in
Italy and the settlement after the defeat of
Napoleon strengthened Austrian control.
Metternich’s proposal for an Italian
Confederation, on the lines of the German
Confederation, was opposed by both Piedmont
and the Pope’s advisers. In the period after 1815
the secret societies attracted the supporters of
the Italian Jacobin tradition. Members of the
Carbonari and other secret societies were not
exclusively concerned with Italian nationalism.
e.g. Carbonari of southern Italy who enjoyed the
greatest public support among the 19th century
revolutionary organizations were more interested
in democratizing Naples than in unifying Italy.
After the failure of the revolutions of 1830-
31, specially in Modena and Bologna, Italians
felt increasingly the need to rely on their own
endeavour and on open methods of agitation.
Giuseppe Mazzini, started Young Italy and
rejected the sectarian model of revolutionary
dictatorship and terror. Mazzini was a
democratic nationalist who simultaneously
rejected both the elitism of the moderates and
the Jacobin ideal of revolutionary dictatorship.
Radicals in Italy saw the monarchial
governments as obstacles to the politics of
integration; to them, their overthrow was the
precondition for a unified nation-state. Radical
nationalism in Italy found its greatest exponent
in Guiseppe Mazzini (1805-1872) who had earlier
joined a branch of the Carbonari in 1827 but
soon became disillusioned by their lack of clear
purpose. He felt that Italy’s freedom from
Austrian domination depended entirely on the
destruction of aristocratic privilege and clerical
authority. With this objective he founded the
Young Italy (Giovine Italia) in 1832 and
envisioned a republican form of government for
a united Italian state. After a failed armed
uprising at Savoy in 1834 Mazzini went into
exile in London.
<br>
<br>
As a radical Unitarian, Mazzini believed that
all forms of federalism were mere mechanisms
for perpetuating the dominance of local elites.
Mazzini’s nationalism was not exclusive and he
believed in the eventual emergence of a United
States of Europe after all nations had become
free. Although he believed in a people’s war of
national liberation he also believed in a
democratic government based on universal
suffrage. Mazzini recognized the importance of
support from the peasantry for his conception of
people’s war but Italian republicans were never
able to bridge the gap between the towns and
the countryside.
The Italian national movement was not based
on such a strong industrial bourgeoisie as in the
case of Germany. The level of economic
unification in Italy prior to political unification
was also on a lesser scale than in Germany, the
Italian customs union being no match for the
German Zollverein. Another serious economic
problem was the considerable backwardness of
the Italian south.
The process of national unification in Italy
was based on the existence of several states which
tried to preserve their autonomy and privileges
in the context of Franco-Austrian rivalry.
Piedmont became the Italian state which unified
Italy. The king, Charles Albert until 1840, evinced
no sentiments in favour of either liberalism or
patriotism. Charles Albert (1831-1840) was a
conservative monarch who had no compunctious
about using Austrian troops to stop revolution
in Italy much like the Metternich system
envisaged.
<br>
<br>
Although Piedmont was not quite the
powerhouse like Prussia in an economic sense, it
was politically and militarily the most active
participant in the process of Italian revolution.
Cavour, Mazzini and Garibaldi have been hailed
in some accounts as the brain, heart and sword
of unification. While Piedmont’s policies had been
timid before 1849, in the 1850s the more resolute
policies of Count Cavour in combination with
the popular movements launched by Mazzini and
Garibaldi led to Italian unification with the
popular movements launched by Mazzini and
Garibaldi led to Italian unification. Cavour used
his friendship and alliance with Napoleon III to
wage successful wars for both the liberation of
Italy from Austria and political unification. The
territorial ambitions of Piedmont-Sardinia and
the desire to preserve social stability shaped the
attitude of the aristocratic Cavour. Unification
was to depend primarily on the regular army
and bureaucracy, not popular movements.
The financial costs of the wars of liberation
had to be borne by Piedmont Sardinia which
adversely affected the programme of
modernization started by Cavour in the 1850s.
Piedmont influence which Piedmont wielded in
the unitary state which was created in 1861.
Earlier, when Pope Pius IX withdrew support
for a national war against Catholic Austria in
April 1848 he lost the support of nationalist
opinion in Italy.
<br>
<br>
After the revolution in Rome and the flight
of the Pope, the Roman Republic was
proclaimed. The efforts of the Pope to return
succeeded in June 1849 with the help of French
and Austrian forces. During the period of Italian
unification, the Pope and the Catholic Church
played a conservative role. After losing temporal
power, the Pope forbade the faithful to
participate in national politics. The opposition of
the Church to the secular state – as well as
socialism, anarchism and the labour movement
– culminated in the merger of anticlericalism with
support for parliamentary democracy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Unification Process</i></strong></div>

Although popular mobilization played a part
in unification process the elites tried to control
the level of popular participation. This is what
led Gramsci to characterize the Risorgimento and
Italian unification as a form of passive revolution.
Secret societies such as the Carbonari, Filadelfi
or Young Italy were active in the 1830s and 1840s
in fomenting revolutions. There was a chain of
rebellions in Turin, Naples, Palermo and other
areas in 1820-21 and a fresh round of rebellions
during 1828-31 and the 1848-49 revolutions in
Germany, the revolutionary coalitions collapsed
with workers, peasants, urban poor and socialists
parting company from the liberal upper and
middle classes.
<br>
<br>
The revolutions of 1848-49 were popular
revolutions but more municipal than national
revolutions. The real problem was that the
democrats failed to secure the support of the
countryside. The 1848-49 revolutions failed but
the heroic defense of the republics – in Rome by
Mazzini and Garbaldi and in Venice by Manin
– produced the legends of Italian nationalism
and the Italian left.
Cavour joined the Crimean War in 1855 on
behalf of Britain and France to gain their support
in this future confrontation with Austria. One of
Cavour’s military officers predicted that out of
the mud of the Crimea Italy would emerge.
Although Italy did not achieve much it got an
opportunity to discuss its problems in an
international forum in 1856, Piedmont Cavour
had consolidated his position by a connubio or
alliance with Urbano Rattazzi of the centre-left
in 1852.
<br>
<br>
Although the republicans were initially
distrustful of Cavour and the Piedmontese they
slowly recognized the pivotal importance which
Piedmont would have to play in Italian
unification. On the basic of the agreement with
Napoleon III at Plombieres in 1858 France, came
to the aid of Piedmont in the war with Austria
which broke out in 1859. Italian National Society
which played a key role in these plebiscites.
Between 1857 and 1862 this Society published a
national newspaper, drafted volunteers,
orchestrated revolutions in Central Italy and then
played a role in the plebiscites. This society was
implicated in Garibaldi’s invasion of Naples as
well as Cavour’s entry into the Papal States “thus
ensuring”, says Coppa, “that the kingdom of
1861 would be national rather than northern.”
Although Garibaldi was upset by the handing
over of his home province of Nice to the French
he collaborated with Cavour in the invasion of
Sicily and Naples. It was the tremendous success
of Garibaldi’s volunteers which galvanized
Cavour into uniting the whole of Italy while
earlier he had concentrated on northern and
central Italy. The 1859 annexations in North and
Central Italy had been achieved without much
collective violence, but in 1860 the transfer of
power in the south was marked by enormous
violence.
<br>
<br>
As far as the unification of Italy was
concerned, the question of Venetia and Rome
remained. Venice was incorporated in Italy after
an overwhelming vote in favour of union in a
plebiscite. After several failed attempts to acquire
Rome – notably Garbaldi’s attempt in 1867 – it
was incorporated after a short war in September
1870.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economic Unification</i></strong></div>

The Italian state after unification did try to
force the pace of economic development in order
to catch-up with the advanced countries. Unlike
the USA and Germany and even France, the
industrialization of Italy was not boosted
substantially by the railways. Even the utilization
of the railways was poor because North and
South did not complement each other; because
the main Italian export-silk-weighed very little;
and because of the general backwardness of the
country. The railway policy of the Italian state
was excessively “forced” in terms of timing as
well as the mode of financing though the
railways sewed up the Italian boot they neither
integrated the south with the Italian economy
nor boosted overall industrial growth.
In Italy the divisions between the more
industrialized north, the less developed central
region and the neglected and backward south
actually intensified after the Italian unification.
The Italian south remained an alienated, almost
colonized, region. The Italian unification, more
due to military success and international
diplomacy rather than people’s war or mass
struggles, was based on the lowest possible
mobilization of the masses required for achieving
independence and unification.
<br>
<br>
In Gramsci’s words, the process of Italian
unification was a form of passive revolution in
which the Italian elite had mobilized the Italian
masses only to the extent necessary to achieve
the political objective of national unification and
independence from Austria.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Disintegration of Empires</i></strong></div>

In the modern international relations system
any a-national or dynastic state could no longer
exist. The Habsburg and Ottoman states hoped
to survive by obstructing, suppressing, or
ignoring, nationalism. But the nation-state did
not have to be the result, although so many
nation-states had come into being. It could as
well have been the multi-national state.
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet
Union are examples. The modern state could exist
only on the basis of the promotion of nationalism;
and this nationalism could equally be a single
nationalism appropriate to the nation-state, or a
number of nationalisms combined through
imaginative federating arrangements into a multinational state.
In principle the Ottoman and Habsburg
empires could have evolved into such multinational entities like the Czechoslovak, Yugoslav,
and Soviet states. But the two empires were
defeated in international war and were carved
up, as happens with almost unfailing regularity
throughout history. In this case, the victors used
nationalism as the principle by which to slice
them up as it was the most readily available and
effective instrument. Yet they were not consistent,
if it did not suit them, as the shifting frontiers in
the Balkans, or finally the Czechoslovak and
Yugoslav states demonstrate. The disintegration
of the two empires was due to both nationalism
and military defeat; military defeat gives most
immediate reasons, and nationalism gives an idea
of the form in which it happened.
<br>
<br>
The Habsburg disintegration corresponded to
the Ottoman with a difference of emphasis. The
primary thrust to the breakup of the Ottoman
Empire was the pressure by the great powers;
nationalism came a distinct second, even if used
by the great powers. The Habsburg process was
similar, but more spectacular. Its early losses in
the nineteenth century were due to French action.
It lost authority over Germany in 1806 when the
Holy Roman Empire was abolished after
Napoleonic victories. In 1860 the French deprived
the Habsburg of their Italian possessions by
promoting the unification of Italy. In 1866, Prussia
drove the Habsburgs finally out of the German
leadership. On the other hand, the Habsburgs
gained territories, chiefly the provinces of Bosnia
and Herzegovina in the western Balkans at the
expense of the Ottoman Empire,
But, despite all the nationalist pressures in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, it was only the
defeat in World War I that led to the final
disintegration, with the victorious powers carving
out the new nations of Czechoslovakia, Hungary
minus the non-Magyars, Romania with
Transylvania, and a south Slav federation called
Yugoslavia, leaving the rump Austria. The process
was more dramatic than the Ottoman as the
Habsburg central state was more modern and
effective. It could contain local nationalism and
hold off international predators better. But, as
usual, international rivalry was the ultimate test;
and the Habsburgs went down like the
Ottomans, and for much the same reasons.

Russian Empire differed from the other two
Empires in terms of its more effective
modernization, relatively lesser losses in wars,
the demographic superiority of the Russians in
relation to other nationalities, the supportive role
of the Orthodox Church thereby ensuring
religious loyalty of the majority of its subjects,
enforced cultural and linguistic unification of the
minority nationalities and the leading role of
Russian nationalism. Even after the Empire broke
up under the impact of the World War I, the
Soviet Union, in a span of twenty years or so,
was able to re-unite most of its constituent units
in a single nation-state.
For this (emergence of a Supra national
structure i.e. USSR), a national territory was
identified on the basis of language, history, and
culture, and it was made into a constituent
Republic of the Soviet Union. The language of
the Republic was then made the official language
for local use, and Russian because the language
for communication with the rest of the Soviet
Union. Universal literacy campaigns were
conducted with great energy such that more
members of that nationality now knew how to
read, write, and speak a single standardized
version of their languages and could use it at all
levels than ever before in history.
<br>
<br>
The full apparatus of education, from primary
to post-secondary was established, so that
members of the nationality could aspire to even
higher levels of scholarship and culture within
their own cultural space. All the national cultural
institutions were created, that is, museums,
theatres, publishing house, radio, and many
newspapers. As much as possible, people of the
local nationality were given preference in local
employment; this process was known as
nativization or korenizatsiia.
All these, put together, were major
achievements for nationalist. But the essential
conditions they had to observe in the twenties
were: All citizens had to accept loyalty to the
Soviet state and accept the dictatorship of the
Communist Party, including its anti-religious
militancy. Security sensitive jobs were controlled
by Russians, as in the intelligence and defence
services.
<br>
<br>
This was followed by the decade of Stalin
which forced industrialization, collectivization,
mass purges, labour camps, appalling man-made
famines, and the final dictatorship of a security
apparatus masquerading as the Party. Now
nationalism was to be permitted in the form made
notorious by the slogan ‘nationalist in form,
socialist in content.’ All the non-socialist, or rather
non-party line, thinking of the nationalists was
denounced. They could promote their culture and
pursue their careers within their respective
Republics and regions only if they followed the
Party line in its details. It was a thoroughgoing 
imposition of uniformity and centralism.
