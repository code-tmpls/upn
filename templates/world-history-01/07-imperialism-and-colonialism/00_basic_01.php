<h3>Imperialism and Colonialism</h3>



The term imperialism means the practice of
extending the power, control or rule by a country
over the political and economic life of the areas
outside its own borders. Imperialism refers to
the process of capitalist development, which leads
the capitalist countries to conquer and dominate
pre-capitalist countries of the world. The
imperialist country or Metropolis (literal meaning
mother country), subordinates another country/
colony for its own economic and political
interests. This may be done through military or
other means and particularly through
colonialism. Colonialism means the practice of
acquiring colonies by conquest (or other means)
and making them dependent. The country which
is subjugated by a metropolitan capitalist country
is described as a colony, and what happens in a
colony is colonialism. In other words, Colonialism
is the total system of imperialist domination of a
pre-capitalist country. Occupation/direct rule
over a country by another country is not always
an essential feature of imperialism. The essential
feature is exploitation, with or without direct
political control. Until recent years, most countries
of Asia Africa and other parts of the world were
under the control of one or another imperialist
country.

<br>
The story of modern world is of trade,
expansion, migrations, settlements, imperialism,
colonialism and challenges to it. Modern World
is the product of a unique type of trading chain
in which Western Europe was clearly at the
centre. This interconnected global trade was
carried on, and was dependent upon, three
major developments of these centuries: 1. mining
of silver with the help of forced labour in the
Americas; 2. forcible transfer of millions of
African slaves across the Atlantic Ocean; and 3.
levying of tribute by the European powers on
Asian shipping and land.
Columbus’s discovery was followed by the
exploitation of the silver mines of the Americas
with the help of local manpower. Population of
Mexico dropped from 25 million to about half a
million during the course of the 16th century, on
account of small pox, influenza and other
diseases. This necessitated the search for new
labour which was forcibly acquired from the
African coast. As a result full-fledged plantation
colonies of African slaves began to be established
in Brazil and the Caribbean islands. The mining
of silver brought unprecedented wealth to
Europe. Asian spices, textiles, silk and indigo
were in demand in the West. Europe’s trade with
Asia was greatly facilitated by the availability of
silver obtained from mines in Americas with the
help of African slave labour. But the trade with
Asia was also not of an equal nature.
Between 1500 and 1800, Western Europe
acquired 35% of the globe’s land surface. This is
despite the fact that in 1800, Europe’s population
was only 190 out of 900 million living on the
planet earth. Great Britain was the architect of
the biggest overseas empire, an empire over which
“the sun never set”. The population of Great
Britain in 1838 was only 19 million but this
country acquired large chunks of Asia and Africa
with many millions of inhabitants. The scholars
of European expansion agree on the superiority
of European political organization and Western
warfare over the various types of non-Western
people. Gunpowder arms and modern state
infrastructure of the West Europeans aided
expansion in the extra-European world. Initial
technological edges were transformed into huge
political advantages. The superiority of the
Western navies especially as regards long-range
bulk transport was one of the principal factors
behind the successful establishment of maritime
empires in the extra-European world. The
unlimited oceanic range of the Western ships gave
them what could be termed as global reach. AfroAsian states could not challenge the maritime
supremacy of the Western naval powers. The
passing of control on the Indian Ocean from
Asian to European hand was a matter of great
political and economic importance. The Arabs
lost control over the spice trade between South
East Asia, India, Egypt and Arabia. The maritime
powers also enabled the European trading
companies to establish coastal enclaves in most
of the territories whose shores lapped the Indian
Ocean. These coastal enclaves became the bases
from which the Europeans expanded.
In 1839, two British frigates defeated 29
Chinese war junks near Hong Kong. Besides
technology, in theory also the Afro-Asians were
lagging behind the maritime European powers.
One of the characteristics of the theoretical works
produced during Renaissance was the application
of geometrical figures and symbols. Diagrams
were used for elucidating theories as well as for
analyzing the different stages of particular great
battles. The eighteenth century European states
established naval schools where mathematics
along with Newton’s Principia was taught. The
Mughals had a riverine navy which conducted
marine warfare against the Zamindars of Bengal
and the Magh pirates in the Chittagong region
during the sixteenth and the seventeenth
centuries. But these ships were no match against
the European men of war. In 1498, Vasco da
Gama arrived at Calicut on the Malabar Coast.
In the same year, eight ships sent by Zamorin
encountered a single Portuguese caravel. A
caravel had a triangular sail and weighed about
200 tons. The bronze cannons of the Portuguese
ship made mincemeat of the Indian ships which
tried to fight with arrows, swords and lances.
Shivaji set up the Maratha navy in 1659. The
most famous Maratha admiral was Kanhoji
Angre (1669-1729). For modernizing his fleet,
Kanhoji hired Portuguese deserters.
<br>
<br>
In 1739, a single Portuguese frigate defeated
Sambhaji Angria’s squadron of 17 vessels. Gheria,
the Maratha naval headquarters finally fell to
the bombardment of British battleships.
While the Royal navy protected the British
sea lines of communications, the Company’s
marine took care of coastal security. By 1934 it
had been rechristened as the Royal Indian Navy.
When Ceylon and Pondicherry were lost, the
French Navy found that Mauritius was too far
away for operating around the subcontinent. The
lack of a maritime base near Indian hampered
French maritime operations. This in turn choked
the supply of men and materials to the French
Army under Count de Lally. After the defeat of
Lally in the late eighteenth century, there was
no European military competition to the East
India Company’s army in the Indian
subcontinent. The British naval supremacy in the
coastal waters of India also shaped land warfare
in favour of the Company. Tipu’s attempt to get
aid from France was unsuccessful. And, the
Mysore navy could achieve little against British
sea power. After the defeat of Tipu, there were
no more naval challenges from the indigenous
powers. In 1848 when Mulraj the Diwan of
Multan revolted, the Second Anglo-Sikh War
broke out. And then the Company’s navy
practiced what could be categorized as ‘Littoral
Warfare’. Naval power came to the aid of the
British during the crisis of 1857 Mutiny. Towards
the end of May 1857, steamers brought white
troops from Madras to Calcutta. The Royal Navy
also brought reinforcements from Britain and
Crimea into India during 1857-58. Sea power
enabled the British government in India to project
power in various parts of Asia. The company
was able to put together a bureaucracy capable
of launching distant amphibious operations.
During the Dutch War of 1795, it was decided
to send troops from India to Malacca. Burma
teak was highly valued by the Royal Navy and
the British merchantmen. And this was a
contributory factor for the Second Anglo-Burma
War during 1852-53. The emergence of shallow
draft steamboats equipped with guns enabled
European penetration into the interiors of Africa
though the rivers. The British penetration into
southern Nigeria through the Niger delta involved
use of naval vessels. Bruce Lenman claims that
in the early eighteenth century, the Dutch and
the French by introducing gunpowder among
the American tribes raised the level of organized
violence. The original inhabitants of the New
World did not use iron. Most of them employed
Stone Age technologies. Hence, Hernan Cortes
with 500 Spaniards and 14 cannon was able to
defeat the Aztek Empire repeatedly between 1519
and 1521. At the siege of Cuzco in 1536, 200,000
Inca soldiers were defeated by 190 Spanish
soldiers. The French towards the end of the
seventeenth century realized that without Indian
allies it was impossible to conduct colonial
warfare successfully in North America. In 1712,
the French allied with the Ottawa and
Potawatomie attacked the Fox tribe. The Indian
tribes of North America, who were allied with
the European powers during the seventeenth
century, taught the Europeans several tactical
lessons like marksmanship, scouting, looking for
cover and concealment in the jungles.
Cooperation with the Indians was essential
even in Central and South America. Economic
potential and demographic resources did not
necessarily generate great military power. For
explaining European military superiority over
Afro-Asia in general and India in particular, most
of the historians followed Edward Gibbon’s
emphasis on gunpowder weapons. Geoffrey
Parker asserts that the military balance changed
in favour of the West because of the Military
Revolution which unfolded between 1500 and
1750. The military revolution on land actually
was an amalgamation of two revolutions. The
first involved a Revolution in Siege Warfare due
to the emergence of trace Italians (star shaped
scientific fortress architecture) and siege artillery.
Then a Revolution in Field Warfare occurred due
to the rise of firearms equipped infantry
supported by field artillery. Another
characteristic of the Military Revolution was
sustained growth in the size of the European
armies. Artillery was so costly that only the
monarchy could maintain it. The Europeans were
well advanced in the field of international finance.
The international credit network sustained the
Western military activities across the globe. The
Afro-Asia armies lacked any regular cohesive
organization. Soldiering was a part time
occupation of the cultivators and pay was
irregular. Professional standing armies were
absent in pre-colonial Afro-Asia. Hence, the AfroAsian soldiers were indisciplined. In battles, the
Africans and the Asians fought as aggregates of
individuals and not as cohesive bodies of soldiers.
Warfare in South-East Asia was also lagging
behind the type of organized violence practiced
by the West. Bloody conflict resulting in total
destruction of the enemy force and permanent
conquest were trends introduced by the
Europeans.
<br>
<br>
While by the 1850s most of Asia was under
the Europeans, even as late as 1876 less than
10% of Africa was under the Europeans. This
was due to lack of surface communication in the
jungle-filled continent and the prevalence of
diseases which hampered operations of the
European armies in the ‘dark continent’. In West
Africa, half of the white soldiers died within
three months of their arrival. While the
eighteenth century witnessed the conquest of
Asia, European expansion in Africa really
gathered speed during the late nineteenth
century. Structural contradictions prevented the
Mughals, Persians and the Chinese from
modernizing their army. They also did not
possess the sea faring culture of the Western
maritime nations. All these factors resulted in
the passing away of the big Asian land empires.
Then the culture of warfare in America and
Africa also aided European conquest. State
organization was virtually non-existent in most
parts of the new World and in Africa. All the
non-European polities were fragile entities and
characterized by divisible sovereignty. This made
possible playing off various ethno linguistic and
religious groups against each other by the
Europeans. It in turn facilitated not only conquest
but also consolidation of imperial rule over the
two American continents as well as in Afro-Asia.
Thus it was a combination of social,
technological, strategic and cultural factors that
gradually brought about the entire world under
European domination.
<br>
<br>
Along with human beings, this migration also
involved movement of animals, plants and
diseases. Long before Columbus, the Vikings in
their long ships discovered Greenland and also
made a landfall in Newfoundland. The Germans
attacked the Western Roman Empire due to rising
demographic pressure and the riches that could
be obtained by plundering the rich Roman
provinces of Gaul (France), Spain and Italy.
The lure of fertile land, pillage and plunder
as well as prospect of trade also encouraged
migrations and settlements. The gradual
desiccation of Central Asia pushed the steppe
nomadic tribes into Southern Asia and Eastern
Europe. Due to the drying up of the heartland of
Eurasia and falling water table, the horse riding
nomads attacked the sedentary civilization.
Increasing cold in Scandinavia also encouraged
Viking migration in the late medieval age. The
Vikings settled in Denmark, England, Normandy
province in France and also in south Italy.
Besides economy, climate, demography and
technology, culture has also been an important
determinant of migration and settlement. The era
of mass migration of the Europeans in the extraEuropean world was preceded by what could be
categorized as the ‘Age of Discovery’. The latter
term refers to intensive maritime exploration of
the oceans by the European mariners. For the
first time, Ferdinand Magellan circumnavigated
the globe during 1519-22.
<br>
<br>
The principal motive behind Europe’s
expansionist drive was the search for trade.
Africa and Asia exported gold, jewel, silk,
carpets, spices and porcelains to Europe. All these
created the notion among the Europeans about
luxury, wealth, skilled artisans and thriving craft
industries in Afro-Asia. Instead of the Italian
cities which were most interested in maritime
trade, it was the West European powers which
took the lead in oceanic voyages. Initially the
European enclaves in the newly discovered lands
were forts and ports. In Asia the indigenous
potentates were quite powerful. The Ottoman
Empire, the Ming Empire and the Mughal Empire
were formidable entities. In such a scenario, the
Europeans found themselves in the role of
supplicants and observers rather than as
conquerors and settlers. Since indigenous
resistance in the New World was weak, the
European coastal enclaves quickly expanded into
big territorial empires. Columbus found gold in
Hispaniola which in turn attracted more
European settlers. The search for labour resulted
in the conquest of Puerto Rico in 1508, Jamaica
in 1509, and Cuba in 1511. The North American
tribes practiced rudimentary hunting and fishing.
The British in North America after settling down
became fishermen, farmers, traders, etc. The early
English settlements in Americas were at
Jamestown and Virginia. In 1760 fight broke out
between the British and the Cherokee whose
hunting land in east Tennessee and west North
Carolina were under pressure due to the
advancing frontier of British American control
and settlement. The rise of European population
in British North America was greater than in
New France because the British were willing to
accept people of all religious backgrounds. By
contrast, the French colonial policy was to
establish catholic colonies in North America.
Among the early migrants there were more
men than women. So, many Spaniards and
Portuguese took Indian women as wives or
concubines. Their offspring were known as
mestizos and they settled mostly among the
coastal regions. The Germans and the Dutch
were minor players. The Russians unlike the West
European maritime powers expanded the
frontiers of Europe in East Asia by overland
migration.
<br>
<br>
In the tropics most Europeans died or could
not sustain self-replicating populations. But, in
temperate America where few Europeans went
they flourished demographically. Tropical
diseases like malaria and yellow fever checked
the Portuguese migration in Africa. Disease
brought by the Europeans devastated the
indigenous population of the New World. After
1704, influenza and smallpox caused rapid
decline of the Maya people. During 1743-9, half
of the indigenous population of the Amazon
Valley fell victim to measles and smallpox.
Smallpox wiped out half of the Cherokee in North
America in the late 1730s. British cattle were
introduced into Virginia. They multiplied rapidly
and the agricultural lands of the Indians were
changed into grazing and pastoral land. Horses
spread throughout North America through trade
and theft. Instead of allowing the Indians to grow
their vegetable crops, the Spanish introduced
sugar plantations, cotton, tobacco and vineyards.
The Europeans introduced timber and dyewood
in Brazil which were exported. Citrus fruits
bought from Spain were introduced in the new
World in the early sixteenth century. The
Spaniards brought banana in 1516 to West Indies
from the Canary Islands. Actually the Portuguese
had introduced banana in the Canary Islands
from tropical Africa. Catastrophic mortality
among the ‘native’ Americans following the
arrival of the Europeans generated search for
cheap labour for working in the estates,
plantations and mines. The resulting slave trade
altered the demography by initiating a major
movement of the Africans from Africa to South
America, West Indies and the southern states of
North America. Between 1680 and 1860, the loss
of population due to slavery from West Africa
was a little over 10%. Slaves were acquired from
Africa either by raiding or through contacts with
the African rulers. The slaves were sold to the
European traders in return for guns, gunpowder
and European clothes. And the African
potentates used the guns for acquiring more slaves
for selling the Europeans. Thus a vicious ‘gunslave’ cycle developed. During the fifteenth
century, African slaves were transported to Lisbon
for sale. Founded in 1575, Luanda in Angola
became the leading port through which slaves
were shipped to Brazil. Congo was a vital source
of slaves. In 1515 African slaves for the first time
were sent to the Americas. Spain sent the African
slaves to Hispaniola in the Caribbean and started
receiving slave grown American sugar. Direct
large scale trans-Atlantic traffic in slaves started
from 1532. The British transported more slaves
than the French. Between 1691 and 1779, British
ships transported 2,300,000 slaves from the
African ports. In the sixteenth century about
367,000 African slaves were sent to the
Americas. Angola supplied 2 million slaves in
the eighteenth century mostly to Brazil. Most of
the Africans transported as slaves in the
eighteenth century went to Brazil and West
Indies, and less than a fifth went to North
America. The Portuguese moved slaves into the
sugar plantations of Northeast Brazil and from
1710s into the gold and diamond fields of Mionas
Gerais. In the late eighteenth century the slaves
were used in the sugar and coffee plantations
near Rio De Janeiro. In most cases the number of
black slaves exceeded the number of white
colonists. The extensive scope of slavery in the
New World becomes clear. Brazil between 1800
and 1850 had between 1,000,000 to 2,500,000
slaves. The slaves amounted to 33% of the
population of the country. Slavery was rampant
in the southern states of USA. Individuals were
taken away from their communities and families
in Africa. Many died while being captured. In
the port towns and in the ships while being
transported across the Atlantic, they were
crowded together in hazardous circumstances.
About 10% of the slaves died while being
transported across the Atlantic. Hacking down
sugarcane was a backbreaking task. Slaves lived
in deplorable conditions. They were less well fed,
housed and clothed than the white population.
Some white settlers were also coerced by the state
to migrate overseas. Between 1720 and 1763, the
British Parliament passed another 16 Acts that
established transportation as a penalty for
crimes of perjury and poaching. Imperialism
is the system of political control exercised by
the metropolis over the domestic and foreign
policy and over the domestic politics of another
polity, which we shall call the periphery
(countries at the margins of the economic
hierarchy). Four important characteristic features
of imperialism are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Sharp increase in international flow of
commodities, men and capital,</li>
        <li>Interdependent set of relations between
countries at different levels of industrial
development,</li>
        <li>Advanced and superior technology in
imperialist countries, and</li>
        <li>Competition between advanced capitalist
countries</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

There were many empires in history but
empire in the era of capitalism is imperialism. In
earlier eras the motive was exaction of tribute.
Under capitalism the economies and societies of
the conquered or dominated areas were
transformed, adapted and manipulated to serve
the imperatives of capital accumulation in the
imperialist countries placed at the centre of the
economic hierarchy. Imperialism is a specifically
European phenomenon whereas colonialism is
the system prevalent in the colonies. Imperialism
can be both formal and informal. Formal
imperialism involves annexation and direct rule
while informal empire means indirect rule by
local elites who are independent legally but
politically dependent on the metropolis.
These types are:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Trading empires which took the initiative in
early conquests but eventually lost out in the
era of industrial capitalism, such as Portugal
and Spain.</li>
        <li>Industrial empires with full-fledged colonies,
such as Britain and France.</li>
        <li>Industrial empires without, or with few,
formal colonies, such as Germany.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

At the same time, it is important to remember
different historical stages through which
capitalist expansion took place leading to the
formation of empires. The changing nature of
capitalism may be said to have gone through the
stages, mentioned below:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>End of 15th to mid 17th Century-rise of
commercial capital and rapid growth of
world commerce.</li>
        <li>Mid 17th to later 18th Century-commercial
capital ripens into a dominant economic
force.</li>
        <li>Late 18th Century to 1870s-the era of
industrial capital.</li>
        <li>1880 to World War I – rise of monopoly
capital, division of Globe, etc.</li>
        <li>Post World War I-socialism, decolonization,
rise of multinational corporations.</li>
        <li>In this sense, stages of imperialism coincide
with stages of capitalism.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Stage of capitalism Imperial powers</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Merchant capitalism Portugal and Spain.</li>
        <li>Industrial capitalism Britain, France and
Netherlands.</li>
        <li>Finance capitalism Britain, USA and
Germany.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


The theories of imperialism can be grouped
into two broad types, economic (J.A. Hobson,
Hilferding, Rosa Luxembourg and Lenin) and
political (Schumpeter, Fieldhouse, Gallagher and
Robinson). They can also be distinguished as
metro centric (Schumpeter, Lenin, Hobson) and
pericentric (Gallagher and Robinson, Fieldhouse).
In Imperialism (1902) Hobson explains
imperialism as an outcome of the capitalist
system. The key concept used is under
consumption. Industry looked for foreign markets
as it could not find domestic markets for its
goods, wages being low. With major industrial
powers competing for foreign markets there was
a race for colonies which would serve as captive
markets. Under consumption also leads to over
saving as domestic investment does not make
sound economic sense when there is little
purchasing power. Thus Hobson concluded that
“…the dominant directive motive” behind
imperialism “was the demand for markets and
for profitable investment by the exporting and
financial classes within each imperialist regime.”
Dismissed other motives as secondary, be it
power, pride and prestige or “trade follows the
flag” or the mission of civilizing the natives. For
Schumpeter, “Imperialism is the objectless
disposition on the part of a state to unlimited
forcible expansion.” Political expansion was a
function of commercial expansion- “trade with
informal control if possible; trade with rule when
necessary.” Gallagher and Robinson’s explanation
of imperialism was pericentric. In their view
imperialism was a process driven by pressures
from the peripheries-Asia, Africa and Latin
Africa. The scramble for colonies was a
preemptive move by European powers to occupy
whatever territory they could in Asia and Africa
so as to keep out rival nations. Fieldhouse
advanced a political explanation for imperialism.
The new imperialism was the extension into the
periphery of the political struggle in Europe. At
the centre the balance was so nicely adjusted
that no major change in the status or territory of
any side was possible. Colonies became a means
out of this impasse. A whole range of theories
and explanations have been offered for
imperialism and are now available with us. These
can broadly be classified into economic and noneconomic explanations. The economic
explanation include the factors pertaining to
overproduction and under consumption
(Hobson), requirements of finance capitalism
(Hilferding), unequal exchange between the
imperial powers and the colonies (Rosa
Luxembourg), and the highest stage of capitalism
(Lenin). The non-economic explanations have
looked at imperialism as a pre-modern atavistic
force (Schumpeter); or have offered a pericentric
view concentrating on the developments in the
colonies rather than the metropolis (Gallaghar
and Robinson); or have seen it merely as an
expression of political struggle within Europe
(Fieldhouse). In 1500 Europe’s dominant position
could not be taken for granted. The Ottoman
Empire, China under the Mings and India under
the Mughals were at the same stage of
development. They suffered from one major
drawback, however, and that was their
domination by a centralized authority which did
not provide conditions conducive to intellectual
growth. Improved cartography, navigational
tables, the telescope and the barometer made
travel by sea safer. This strengthened Europe’s
technological advantage further. The discovery
of America and of the route to the Indies via the
Cape of Good Hope had great consequences for
Europe. It liberated Europe from a confined
geographic and mental cell.
<br>
<br>
The old colonialism had its natural limits.
Flow of precious metals declined. By the late 18th
century Spanish and Portuguese power declined
and they lost their colonies. Dutch monopoly on
shipping ended. Britain was now the world leader
in empire, finance and trade. Europe’s conquest
of America, Africa and Asia from the sixteenth
century was possible only because of her mastery
of the seas. In this the countries on the Atlantic
seaboard, Portugal, Spain, France, Britain and
Holland, had an obvious advantage because of
their geographical location. Europe’s domination
was disastrous for other people: the indigenous
populations in the Americas were wiped out and
twelve million Africans were made slaves between
1500 and 1860. Europe benefited vastly in this
era when merchant capital controlled the world
economy. Institutions such as the modern state
and bureaucracy and the scientific revolution in
knowledge laid the foundations of the modern
world. Hobsbawm describes the Industrial
Revolution in Britain as that unusual moment in
world history when the world’s economy was
built around Britain. The early British industrial
economy relied for its expansion on foreign trade.
Overseas markets for products and overseas
outlets for capital were crucial. The cotton
industry exported eighty per cent of its output at
the end of the nineteenth century. The iron and
steel industry exported forty per cent of its output
in the mid nineteenth century. In return Britain
bought specialized local products such as cotton
from the US, wool from Australia, wheat from
Argentina. etc. The age of mercantilism was over
and with it tariff barriers stood dismantled. The
new watchword was free trade. With the spread
of industrial capitalism the need grew for colonies
as markets for manufactured goods especially
textiles and suppliers of raw materials such as
cotton and food grains. The colony emerged as
a subordinate trading partner whose economic
surplus was appropriated through trade based
on unequal exchange. This international division
of labour condemned the colony to producing
goods of low value using backward techniques.
By the 1860s other countries like Germany and
United States, were catching up with Britain in
industrialization. In 1900 Britain was the
unquestioned world leader. Her empire extended
to twelve million square miles and a quarter of
the world’s population. The race for colonies
speeded up from the 1880s with the entry of
Germany, Italy, US, Belgium and Japan into the
race for colonies. These imperialist rivalries which
carved up the world into colonies, semi colonies
and spheres of influence also divided Europe into
blocks armed to the teeth, the logical corollary of
which was World War I. The informal empire
of trade and finance was added to the empire of
industrial capital. Capital accumulation on a
large scale took place because of the development
of trade and industry at home and extended
exploitation of colonies and semi colonies. The
stranglehold of monopoly capital can be gauged
from the statistic that by 1914 European nation
controlled over 84.4 per cent of the world. Capital
was concentrated in and channeled through first,
the City of London and then New York, the
centre of the international network of trade and
finance.
<br>
<br>
Between 1870 and 1913, London was the
financial and trading hub of the world. By 1913
Britain had 4000 million pounds worth abroad.
Most international trade was routed through
British ships at the turn of the twentieth century.
After World War I Britain lost this position to
the US. The US became the major dominant
capitalist economy. She was now the world’s
largest manufacturer, foreign investor, trader and
banker and the US $ became the standard
international currency. The drain of wealth or
the unilateral transfer of capital from India after
1765 amounted to two to three per cent of the
British national income at a time when only about
five per cent of the British national income was
being invested. In the 19th Century India
emerged as a major market for British
manufacturers and supplied food grains and raw
materials. Opium from India was sold in China,
enabling Britain’s triangular trade with China.
Railways were a major area of investment of
capital. Britain’s international balance of
payments deficit was handled by the foreign
exchange got from Indian exports. British
shipping grew in leaps and bounds on the back
of its control over India’s coastal and
international trade.
<br>
<br>
India played a crucial role in the development
of British capitalism during this stage. British
industries especially textiles were heavily
dependent on exports. India absorbed 10 to 12
per cent of British exports and nearly 20 percent
of Britain’s textile exports during 1860-1880.
After 1850, India was also a major importer of
engine coaches, rail lines and other railway store.
Moreover, the Indian army played an important
role in extending British colonialism in Asia and
Africa. Throughout this stage the drain of wealth
and capital to Britain continued. The Home
Charges (India’s payments for receiving “good”
administration from Britain) and the interest
payments on the Indian Public Debt were
important in financing Britain’s balance of
payments deficit. Thus the pride and glory
underlying the slogan of 'the sun never sets on
the British Empire' were used to keep workers
contented on whose slum dwellings the sun
seldom shone in real life. The British Indian army
was the only large scale army contingent
available to Britain. It was therefore not a surprise
that the British Empire in Asia and Africa
collapsed once Britain lost control over the Indian
army and finances.
<br>
<br>
If imperialism is what happens in the
metropolis, then colonialism is what happens in
the colonies. The same system of capitalism that
produced development in the Western world
created under development in the colony. In this
sense imperialism and colonialism are two sides
of the same coin.
<br>
<br>
<b>Typology of colonies:</b> colonies of settlement
and of exploitation, inland colonies and overseas
colonies, colonies under direct rule and colonies
controlled only indirectly. South Africa, Australia,
Canada were colonies of white settlers whereas
India and Indonesia were colonies exploited
economically and politically over centuries. Neocolonialism is the continuation of colonialism by
non-formal means. Economic policies were
dictated and military might was harnessed by
the imperial power. The US was the foremost
neo-colonial power in the later phase. Andre
Gunder Frank’s major contribution was followed
by those of C. Furtado, Theodore Dos Santosa,
Paul Prebisch, Paul Baran, Samir Amin,
Immanuel Wallerstein, Arghiri Emmanuel and
F. Cardoso. According to the dependency school
(Andre Gunder Frank, Samir Amin etc.). A colony
would continue to be economically dependent
even after achieving political freedom, as long as
it remains a part of capitalism-as the capitalist
class was incapable of undertaking the task of
development. Wallerstain’s world systems
approach divided the capitalist world into the
centre, periphery and semi-periphery, between
which a relationship of unequal exchange
prevailed. The core economies of the centre
produced high value products and had strong
states. The periphery was constrained by low
technology and low wages, the state was weak
as was the capitalist class and the economy was
dominated by foreign capital. The countries on
the semi-periphery, like India, were marked by
greater control of the state in the national and
international market. Economic nationalism was
the hallmark of such States. Cultural aspects of
colonialism were highlighted by Amilcar Cabral,
Franz Fanon and Edward Said. Colonialism is
as modern a historical phenomenon as industrial
capitalism. It is a well structured whole, a distinct
social formation in which the basic control of
the economy and society is in the hands of a
foreign capitalist class. Colonialism is a specific
structure. Colonial economy was neither precapitalist nor capitalist, it was colonial, i.e., a
hybrid creation. Colonialism was distorted
capitalism. 
<br>
<br>
Integration with the world economy
did not bring capitalism to the colony.
Colonialism did not develop social and productive
forces, rather, it underdeveloped them.
Colonialism is a social formation in which
different modes of production coexist from
feudalism to petty commodity production to
agrarian, industrial and finance capitalism.
Unlike capitalism, where the surplus is
appropriated on the basis of the ownership of
the means of production, under colonialism
surplus is appropriated by virtue of control over
state power. One basic feature of colonialism is
that under it the colony is integrated into the
world capitalist system in a subordinate position.
Colonialism is characterized by unequal
Exchange. The exploitative international division
of labour meant that the metropolis produced
goods of high value with high technology and
colonies produced goods of low value and
productivity with low technology. The colony
produced raw materials while the metropolis
produced manufactured goods. Unequal
exchange, external integration and internal
disarticulation, drain of wealth, and a foreign
political domination may be understood as the
four main features of colonialism. The colonial
state is integral to the structuring and functioning
of the colonial economy and society. It is the
mechanism by which the metropolitan capitalist
class controls and exploits the colony. The colonial
state serves the long term interests of the capitalist
class of the mother country as a whole, not of
any of its parts. Under colonialism all the
indigenous classes of the colony suffer
domination. The colonial state guaranteed law
and order and for its own security from internal
and external dangers. It suppressed indigenous
economic forces hostile to colonial interest. The
colonial state actively fostered the identities of
caste and community so as to prevent national
unity. The colonial state relied on the whole on
domination and coercion rather than leadership
and consent. There were three distinct stages of
colonialism. The stages were the result of the
following factors:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The historical development of capitalism
as a world system;</li>
        <li>The change in the society, economy and
polity of the metropolis;</li>
        <li>The change in its position in the world
economy and lastly;</li>
        <li>The colony’s own historical development.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<b>First Stage:</b> Monopoly Trade and Plunder
The first stage had two basic objectives. In
order to make trade more profitable indigenously
manufactured goods were to be bought cheap.
For this competitors were to be kept out, whether
local or European. Territorial conquest kept local
traders out of the lucrative trade while rival
European companies were defeated in war. Thus,
the characteristic of the first stage was monopoly
of trade.
<br>
<br>
Secondly, the political conquest of the colony
enabled plunder and seizure of surplus. For
example, the drain of wealth from India to Britain
during the first stage was considerable. It
mounted to 2 to 3% of the National Income of
Britain at that time. Colonialism was superimposed on the traditional systems of economy
and polity. No basic changes were introduced in
the first stage.
<br>
<br>
<b>Second Stage:</b> Era of Free Trade
The interest of the industrial bourgeoisie of
the metropolis in the colony was in the markets
available for manufactured goods. For this it was
necessary to increase exports from the colony to
pay for purchase of manufactured imports. The
metropolitan bourgeoisie also wanted to develop
the colony as a producer of raw materials to
lessen dependence on non-empire sources.
Increase of exports from the colony would also
enable it to pay for the high salaries and profits
of merchants. The industrial bourgeoisie opposed
plunder as a form of appropriation of surplus on
the ground that it would destroy the goose that
laid the golden eggs. In this stage changes in the
economy, policy, administration, social, cultural
and ideological structure were initiated to enable
exploitation in the new way. Capitalists were
allowed to develop plantations, trade, transport,
mining and industries. The system of transport
and communications was developed to facilitate
the movement of massive quantities of raw
materials to the ports for export.
<br>
<br>
<b>Third Stage:</b> Era of Finance Capital
Large scale accumulation of capital in the
metropolis necessitated search for avenues for
investment abroad. These interests were best
served where the imperial powers had colonies.
This led to more intensive control over the colony
in order to protect the interests of the imperial
power. A major contradiction in this stage was
that the colony was not able to absorb metropolitan capital or increase its exports of raw
materials because of overexploitation in the
earlier stages. A strategy of limited modernization was implemented to take care of this
problem. The conquest of Africa took place in
the last decades of the nineteenth century. Till as
late as 1880 only 20 per cent of Africa had come
under European rule. The first phase, 1880-1919,
was one of conquest and occupation. The colonial
system was consolidated after 1910. The second
phase, 1919-35, was that of the independence
movements. The third stage was from 1935
onwards. The impact of colonialism in Africa
was tremendous. The self sufficient African
economies were destroyed, transformed and
subordinated by colonial domination. Class
differentiation in African society occurred as a
result on the impact of colonial domination. The
links of African countries with each other and
with other parts of the world were disrupted.
European powers reduced the economies of
Africa to colonial dependencies through the
power of finance capital. The loans for the Suez
Canal enmeshed Egypt in debt.
<br>
<br>
The imperialist school of thought would have
it that Africans welcomed colonial rule. Social
Darwinism justifies colonialism by arguing that
the domination over the weaker races was the
inevitable result of the natural superiority of the
European race. The positive effects of colonialism,
if any, were byproducts; they were clearly not
consciously intended. The negative impact was
huge and in all shares, with long lasting legacies.
For example, ethnic conflicts which paralyzed
many parts of Africa today are rooted in the
arbitrary superimposition of territorial boundaries
on an essentially tribal society.
Colonialism in South-East Asia lasted five
centuries, from the late fifteenth to the mid
twentieth century. Even after the heyday of the
spice trade, South-East Asia remained important
as a supplier of basic raw materials like oil,
rubber, metals, rice, coffee, tea and sugar. The
impact of colonialism in this region was
considerable, even on countries like Thailand,
which did not formally become colonies.
Traditional forms of government disappeared,
trading patterns were disrupted and the rich
cultural tradition of these regions were destroyed.
Wallerstein would have it that there was a
basic paternalism which ran through the
philosophies of all the colonial powers. But this
basic paternalism expressed itself in very
different forms, depending on the history and
national character of the colonial powers. From
the beginning there was a sparseness and
economy about British colonial policy. The British
used trading companies to acquire colonies,
insisted that colonies be self sustaining and varied
the political structure in each of the colonies to
suit local needs. “This, then, is the classic contrast
between Africa’s two colonial powers, Britain
and France: Britain-empirical, commercial,
practicing indirect rule, keeping Africans at a
distance, verging on racism; France- Cartesian
in its logic, seeking glory, practicing direct
administration, acting as apostle of fraternity and
anti-racism.” In practice the differences were not
so clear in fact, there were parallel degrees of
political, social and economic discrimination in
two settler territories like Kenya and Algeria.
There was also parallel absence of legal
discrimination. In Britain civil servants were
nonpartisan whereas in France junior civilians
were political.
<br>
<br>
There were broadly four types of decolonization:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Self government for white settler colonies as
it happened in Canada and Australia.</li>
        <li>Formal end to empire followed by
independent rule as in India.</li>
        <li>Formal empire replaced by informal empire
or neo-colonialism as in Latin America.</li>
        <li>Mere change of imperial masters- in IndoChina when the French reluctantly left, the
US move in.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


The explanations of decolonization have been
classified as follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>The nationalist approach</li>
        <li>International context approach</li>
        <li>Domestic constraints approach</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

In the nationalist view indigenous resistance
and anti imperialist struggle led to independence.
According to D.A. Low, the primary factor
behind the end of empire was anti-imperialist
movements-the metropolitan response only
influenced the nature of this confrontation, not
the outcome. The British imperialists presented
the unraveling of empire as an orderly and
rational process but the messy reality was much
less consistent and unavoidable, as John Darwin
has pointed out. In short, far from a planned
withdrawal from empire, there was the
irreversible erosion of position as imperial powers
struggled to retain power by one means or
another, conciliation or repression.
According to the approach highlighting the
international context of decolonization, empires
could not survive in the new world order after
the Second World War. The changed
international climate was reflected in the Atlantic
Charter issued by the Allies during the War
which called for the independence of colonial
people. The United Nations General Assembly
went a step further in 1960 in its Declaration on
the granting of independence to colonial countries
and people. It sharply condemned colonial rule
as a denial of fundamental human rights in
contravention of the UN Charter.
<br>
<br>
This international approach attributes the end
of empires to the opposition of the US and USSR
to ‘old style imperialism’. The US and USSR had
nothing to gain from the older imperial powers,
such as Britain and France, retaining their
colonies. They had everything to gain from the
end of empire as this enabled these two emerging
superpowers to establish their influence over the
newly independent countries of Asia and Africa.
The metropolitan or domestic constraints
approach focuses on how the colony became too
big a burden on the mother country. In this
explanation the end of empire is seen as a
political choice made under pressure of domestic
constraints and calculations of national interest.
The mother country’s will to rule slackened once
empire became too much of a nuisance,
financially, militarily and in international
relations. Historians John Gallagher and other
scholars in the imperialist tradition argued that
British imperial interests in India were declining,
that India no longer fulfilled its role in the
maintenance of imperial interests in the fields of
either defence or commerce or finance and that,
in fact, over the years it had become a liability
for the British.
<br>
<br>
Another factor was the post war expansion
of the welfare state. Decolonization gathered
pace once social reform became a priority and
empire began to be perceived as a drain on
resources. The twentieth century was the era of
decolonization. At the end of the twentieth
century the world was no longer Eurocentric.
The twentieth century had seen the decline and
fall of Europe, which had been the centre of
power, wealth and western civilization at the
beginning of the century. In the first decade of
the twentieth century the nationalists posed a
challenge in Asia and Africa. They were
encouraged by the ability of Japan, a small Asian
country, to inflict a crushing defeat on Russia, a
European power, in 1905. Some of the well
known leaders of the national movements were
Sun Yat Sen in China, Arabi Pasha in Egypt and
Bal Gangadhar Tilak in India. These movements
were led, in this stage, by English educated
middle class elites whose demand for a say in
the running of their countries was changing into
a demand for independence.
<br>
<br>
The First World War further fuelled
nationalist discontent. The War effort had meant
increased exploitation of colonies for raw
materials, manpower and taxes and nationalists
naturally questioned why the colonies should
bear this burden. In 1919 when a new
international order was emerging in Europe the
national movements in the colonies underwent a
transformation in a mass direction. In India this
change was brought by Mahatma Gandhi; China
had the May 4th Movement; in Turkey Kemal
Ataturk rose to power, and in Indonesia the
national movement reached a membership of 2.5
million. Difference emerged between the old
imperial powers like Great Britain and the newer
ones like the US and Japan, on whether the old
order should continue at all, and if so in what
form? This stance of the newer world powers
encouraged nationalists greatly. In the years after
the Russian revolution the process of colonial
emancipation and decolonization went much
further. Anti-imperialist activity was fuelled
because of the world wide depression of 1929.
Sharpening of conflict as in Egypt and India and
victory of Republican ultras under De Valera in
the Irish elections of 1932 were belated anticolonial reactions to the economic breakdown.
The impact of the depression was the loosening
of links between the colony and the metropolis,
which encouraged independent capitalist growth
in the colony.
<br>
<br>
World War II showed up Great Britain as a
second fiddle to the US in the Anglo American
alliance. After 1945 the US and Russia became
the two superpowers.
In the third world, the Second World War
had caused great upheavals, political and
economic. Within years of the end of the War
many colonies gained independence, but often
after protracted disagreement, encouraged by the
imperial power, on the contentions issue of
distribution of power, leading to partition and
civil war. Various areas of troublesome conflict
in the 1970s and 80s, Middle East, Cyprus, South
Africa, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, were legacies of
British decolonization.
<br>
<br>
There are also significant differences between,
for example, French and British decolonization.
For example, if the British maintained strategic,
political and cultural interests in its erstwhile
colonies through the Commonwealth, the cultural
integration was the mode of association preferred
by the French. The French had no mechanism
like the British Commonwealth to ease the
transition of colonies to independence. Whereas
the liberation of India from British colonial rule
set off a chain reaction of independence in other
British colonies, such as Burma and Ceylon,
France continued to cling to its colonial
possessions. France refused to see the writing on
the wall in Indo-China. By 1945 there were
popular revolts against the French in many parts
of Vietnam, which then came under communist
control, with the help of the quite remarkable
Vietnamese guerrilla army. The French were
conclusively defeated in the battle of Dien Bien
Phu in 1954.
Indian independence in 1947 was followed
by independence in Burma in 1948 and Ceylon
in the same year. Malaya gained independence
nine years later. Ghana gained independence
under Kwame Nkrumah in 1957. Togo,
Cameroon, Somalia and Nigeria became
independent in 1960. In 1964 all seven British
East and Central African colonies, Somaliland,
Tanganyika, Uganda, Zanzibar, Nyasaland and
Northern Rhodesia became independent.
Botswana and Swaziland followed in 1966.
Britain was not willing to hand over power in
Kenya because of white settlers there and hence
got embroiled in suppressing a protracted and
violent revolt, such as the Mau.
The French colonies of Morocco and Tunisia
gained independence in 1956. In contrast,
independence was completely ruled out for
Algeria as it was seen as an integral part of
France. This short sighted policy was to lead to
a bloody war, as in Vietnam. In Africa local
autonomy was granted in 1956 but the colonies
were placed in a union, termed the French
Community, strictly controlled by France. Eight
colonies in French West Africa, four in French
Equatorial Africa and Madagascar gained
independence in 1960. Thus there were three
different policies followed by the French in Africa.
In the words of Immanuel Wallerstenin, “as a
result of their special Framework of thinking
concerning the colonies, the British were the first
to begin the process of decolonization.” They
accepted national independence as a legitimate
objective. They were anxious to avoid a repetition
of what happened in America in their other
settler colonies, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand. “The French concept of constitutional
advance was to draw colonies closer to France,
not push them farther away.” French Africans
were elected to legislative bodies. The British
associated Africans with local bodies whereas
the French associated Africans with French
bodies. The British sought to maintain influence
in their colonies after the end of empire by
encouraging their ex-colonies to follow the
Westminster model of parliamentary government
with its multi party system. The French did not
care what form of government was adopted,
their concern was with cultural rather than
political influence. The British and French
opposed federations in French West and
Equatorial Africa as the nationalists were behind
them whereas the British worked towards
federation as they would be useful in the postindependence situation. There were differences
between the British and French perceptions of
the role of the civil service. In Britain, civil servants
were nonpartisan whereas in France junior
civilians were political. However, this made little
difference after independence. Yet, the outcome
of these very different policies of the British and
French was the same. Widespread economic and
political discontent in Africa led to the uniform
collapse of empire across British and French
colonies. This seriously questions the view that
French and British Africa were poles apart.
<br>
<br>
Indian independence had an amazing
demonstration effect. The achievement of
independence in India triggered off a wave of
similar developments across Africa and Asia.
