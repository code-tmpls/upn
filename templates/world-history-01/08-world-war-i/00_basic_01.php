<h3>World War- I</h3>


World War Changed the World
The theatre of war in World War I was mostly
Europe. But the rest of the world was forced to
contribute as colonies, or others like the USA
entered the war for their own reasons. They were
total wars (fought not merely by professional
armies, but as much by civilian populations
engaged in war efforts and being targeted as
combatants). Mobilization of resources was
colossal, and the level of destruction left observers
speechless.
<br>
<br>
The capacity and nature of destruction now
acquired new features. The first was genocide,
or the killing of an entire group of people. This
was first attempted between 1915 and 1923 on
the Armenians by Turkish nationalists, and then
by the Nazis on Jews and Gypsies (Roma) during
World War II. Never before in history had killing
on this scale been attempted. More significantly,
it was not carried out in bursts of anger, as in
communal riots, nor even by small organizations,
but by the modern state. The genocides were
modern, and belonged entirely to the modern
world. That was a singular aspect of the crisis of
modernity in the twentieth century.
The other notable feature is that modern
civilization had, during the war, acquired the
capacity for the annihilation of the human
species. This was revealed when atomic bombs
were dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
1945. Modern class society, built around the
central drama of the struggle between capital
and labour, became obsolete in Europe and
America, as new technologies and organization
systems led to new social relations, collectively
called the postindustrial.
<br>
<br>
The wars put an end to the nation-state
system, with supra-national agglomerations
taking shape. The sovereignty of the nation-states
of Europe was now subordinated in the Cold
War to the power blocs of East and West, led
respectively by the USSR and USA.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WORLD WAR - I</i></strong></div>

Imperial and colonial rule came to an end
with the expulsion of the British from India, the
French from Indo-China and finally the Americans from Vietnam, besides numerous decolonization processes in Africa and the Middle East.
The Wars were in every sense a struggle for
the mastery of the planet. At the beginning of
the century, the world saw six contenders for
domination of the earth, the USA, UK, France,
Germany, Russia, and Japan. The two Wars
reduced the six to two; USA and USSR.
It is still not yet clear what form the power
structure will assume in the twenty-first century,
whether the USA will retain its supremacy,
whether the European Union and China would
become challengers, whether Russia would revive
and in what form, and whether India would
play a leading role at all. But one thing can be
said for sure is ‘World wars changed the World
for ever’.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Growing Rivalries</i></strong></div>

The world economy of capitalism from mid
19th century onwards was a conglomeration of
national blocs or national economies which had
emerged with the growing number of nation
states. These states protected their industrializing
economies against competition from other
nations. Thus these nations also became rival
economies.
<br>
<br>
The period inevitably saw the hunt for more
profitable investment and more markets. This led
to the clamor for colonies outside the areas
traditionally dominated by Britain. Economic
competition and economic rivalry between nation
states led to imperialism of the 20th century and
to the genesis of the 1st World War.
Germany’s strength was increasing more so
after the unification. France was defeated in the
Franco-Prussian War of 1870. Under the
subsequent Peace of Frankfurt in 1871 France
had to pay an indemnity of 200 million pounds
and agreed that thirty thousand German troops
would remain in Paris until the amount had been
paid. Bismarck evolved the "system of the great
European alliances."
Apart from the growing strength of Germany,
another important development in this period
was the expansionism of Russia. As the Ottoman
Empire weakened and the nationalist aspirations
of the Balkan peoples became stronger, the
Russians could not restrain themselves. Many of
the subject nationalities of the Ottoman Empire
were Slav and therefore had a strong ethnic
affinity with the Russians. Hence Russia gave
support to the secessionist moves of these various
Balkan peoples, especially the Rumanians and
Serbians. This went against the interests of Britain
which did not want a dismemberment of the
Ottoman Empire.
<br>
<br>
France was also unhappy. From as early as
the time of the Crusades, France had been
regarded as the protector of Christian rights in
the East. But now the Russian Tsar, by posing as
the champion of Orthodox or Eastern
Christianity, which was the version of
Christianity largely followed in the Balkans
region, was challenging the French claim.
French imperialism in Africa made rapid
strides in the 1880s. Tunis was occupied in 1881.
Madagascar was brought under control in 1884.
It desired to advance into the Sahara region for
which it would have to control Morocco. But
Germany and Spain were also interested in the
Morocco region. French expansion into the
Sudan region led to conflict with Britain and
confrontation on the Niger and at Fashoda.
Moreover, by 1882 France had to forego its
control over Egypt to Britain.
<br>
<br>
The Treaty of San Stefano (which concluded
the Russo-Turkish war) was placed before a
Congress of all the major European powers—
Britain, France, Turkey, Russia, Italy and
Germany—in June 1878 at Berlin. Russia's gains
were reduced while Austria stood to gain by
being allowed to occupy and administer Bosnia
and Herzegovina. Britain got Cyprus and France
was promised a free hand in Turkey's North
African territory of Tunisia. However, Italy and
Germany did not gain any territories as a result
of this Congress.
But what was even more alarming for Britain
was Russia's expansion in the Central Asian
region prospect of a Russian takeover of
Afghanistan, which was a buffer state within
the Britain sphere of influence. In 1885, Russian
forces occupied a part of Afghan territory. The
British Prime Minister asked Parliament to vote
him eleven million pounds for resisting the
Russians. But once again the Tsar, Alexander III,
realizing that it was better to exercise discretion,
decided to withdraw and to turn his energies
instead towards expansion in China.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Power Combinations</i></strong></div>

Austria-Hungary was steadily losing its
importance during this period. However, for
Germany it was a natural ally, especially against
Russia. Though the alliance of the Three
Emperors (Russia, Germany and AustriaHungary) known as the Dreikaiserbund had been
forged in June 1881 and renewed in 1884, it
finally broke down in 1887. As differences
between Russia and Germany increased, AustriaHungary as well as Italy drew closer to Germany.
This process culminated in the formation of the
Triple Alliance in 1882. By the 1890s Russia was
experiencing great isolation. So was France. This
brought the two together in a Dual Alliance in
1893. Thus, in the 1890s, two sets of European
alliances existed.
<br>
<br>
In 1904 the Entente Cordiale or Anglo-French
agreement was signed. It settled all their main
differences over colonies. France recognized
British interests in Egypt while Britain in turn
endorsed French interests in Morocco. This
agreement was only a "friendly understanding",
not an alliance. But Germany's aggressive
postures, especially in Morocco, brought the
French and the British closer to each other. It
also brought Germany and France very close to
war in 1906 and it was only an international
conference at Algericas, in which the
independence of Morocco was reaffirmed, which
defused the issue.
In 1905 Russia suffered an ignominious defeat
at the hands of Japan. This humbled Russian
aspirations and the Anglo-Russian Agreement
of 1907 settled the long-standing rivalries between
the two powers over Afghanistan, Persia and
Tibet. Thus a Triple Entente of Britain, France
and Russia, to rival the Triple Alliance of
Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy, had
materialized.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Balkan Problem</i></strong></div>

The outbreak of a revolution in Turkey in
1908 by a group of liberal patriots, who called
themselves the "Young Turks", overthrew the
Sultan's rule. As fallout of these developments,
Austria decided to annex Bosnia and
Herzegovina, which it had been administering
since 1878. This brought protests from Russia. It
demanded that Austria's action be brought before
an international conference. The Serbians, who
had nurtured hopes of acquiring BosniaHerzegovina some day, joined the Russians in
their protest.
But Germany and Austria held that they
would not agree to a conference unless the
annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina was
recognized beforehand. Ultimately, they had their
way largely because Russia, after its defeat at
the hands of Japan, was in no position to go to
war against Austria-Hungary and Germany at
this juncture. This incident revealed the might of
Germany and its growing ability to strongly assert
itself, though on this occasion on behalf of
Austria. This tendency had ominous forebodings
for the future. Italy entered into a secret
understanding with Russia in 1909 whereby it
promised to support Russia's interests in the Straits
of Dardanelles in return for Russia's support for
Italian designs in Tripoli (Libya).

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Run Up to the War</i></strong></div>

In 1889 England had adopted a "two-power
standard" whereby the British would have a
naval fleet 10% stronger than the combined
navies of the two next-strongest powers.
Germany had in 1898 embarked on a course of
naval expansion which made it the secondstrongest naval power in the world by 1914. This
was galling for England which felt that Germany
did not really require a navy, especially since it
already had such a powerful army. A naval
build-up could only mean that it wished to
challenge Britain's naval supremacy sometime in
the future. The naval rivalry worsened relations
between Germany and Britain considerably.
1912, Italy suddenly decided to take the
plunge and annexed Tripoli. It had secured the
consent of all the major powers in this campaign
and hence there was no major Moroccan-type
crisis this time. In October 1912 Greece and Serbia
invaded the Ottoman Empire and decisively
defeated it. By the Treaty of London of May 1913,
the Ottoman Empire lost all its European
possessions except the region adjacent to the
Straits of Dardanelles.
<br>
<br>
In the immediate run-up to the First World
War the growing strength and aggressive designs
of Serbia were an important contributory factor.
This small country was determined to add to its
territories. Immediate cause of the First World
War was the assassination of Archduke Francis
Ferdinand, heir to the Austrian throne at the
Bosnian capital of Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. A
secret society of Serbian nationalists called the
"Black Hand" was responsible for the killing. Even
though the Serbian government did not have any
hand in the assassination, Austria was
determined to punish Serbia for the murder. On
28 August 1914, it broke off diplomatic relations
with Serbia and declared war on it. Russia,
anxious about Serbia's fate, also prepared for war
against Austria.
Germany, on seeing this, sent an ultimatum
to Russia demanding that it cease its preparations
for war. On receiving a reply from the Tsar that
this was impossible, Germany declared war on
Russia on 1 August 1914. It followed it up with
a declaration of war on France two days later.
The idea was to strike France at its most
vulnerable spot, at the border between France
and Belgium. It was Germany's invasion of
Belgium which brought Britain into the war.
Behind Serbia was the long-standing conflict
between the Russians and the Austrians. Austria
had Germany as a strong ally and Russia had
France. If France was threatened with invasion,
Britain felt vulnerable and was therefore
compelled to come to the rescue of France.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reasons of World War 1</i></strong></div>

The beginning of the century witnessed the
division of the world into major international
forces based on distinct ideologies. Since their
conflicts and rivalries could not be resolved
through any peaceful mechanism, they resulted
in the outbreak of the two world wars. The two
wars were caused by a variety of factors. Some
of the most important ones are discussed below.
Industrialization & Economic Rivalries
The opening years of the nineteenth century
saw the industrial manufacturing techniques
extended beyond England to more and more
states, such as Belgium (1815-30), Sweden,
France, United States and Prussia (1840-60),
Norway, Russia and Japan (1870-90). Rapid
growth of the American and German economies
began to displace England from this position of
pre-eminence from the 1880s. The growth of
Japan after the Meiji restoration (1868) and
industrialization of Russia further altered the
global economic environment.
<br>
<br>
A crisis seemed imminent as the expanding
industrialization tended to globalise the economy.
In fact, the world system of capitalism was still
working in the form of competing "national
economies". The closing years of the nineteenth
century did see the crystallization of this trend.
The latecomers in the field of industrialization
(such as Prussia, Russia and Japan) were staking
claims beyond the "national territories". The PanGerman League, founded in 1893 and
representing right-wing conservative forces
wanted economic and territorial control over
Central Europe. They claimed Belgium, the
French iron ore district, the French channel coast
to the Somme and a Mediterranean base at
Toulon, along with Poland and the Baltic states.
They also envisaged a Central European
federation comprising Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria,
Romania, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland under
the leadership of Germany together with German,
French and Belgian colonies attached to it.
Hitler not only wanted a union (Anschluss)
with Austria but also aimed to get sufficient
living-space (Lebensraum) for the German
'people'. The Italian right-wing similarly used
class-concepts of 'proletarian' (have-nots) and
'plutocratic' (have) nations to redefine
international relations and to claim colonies for
a 'proletarian' Italy. In Japan, similarly, the rightwing militant nationalists (Black Dragon Society
1901), Empire Foundation Society (1926), and
Japan Production Party (1931), demanded an
"equitable distribution of world resources". They
even favoured military action to establish "A Coprosperity Zone" in the East under the Japanese
leadership.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Camp Formations and Arms Build Up</i></strong></div>

In 1879, Germany and Austria-Hungary
agreed to go to war if either country was
attacked by Russia. Italy joined the agreement in
1882, and it became known as the Triple Alliance.
In 1894, France and Russia agreed to mobilize
troops if any nation in the Triple Alliance
mobilized forces. They agreed to help each other
if either were attacked by Germany. In 1904,
alarmed by German naval buildup, Britain ended
their "splendid isolation". It not only settled the
past differences over colonies but also signed the
Entente Cordiale (friendly agreement) with
France. Although the agreement contained no
pledges of military support, the two countries
began to discuss joint military plans. In 1907,
Russia joined the Entente Cordiale, and it became
known as the Triple Entente. These alliances left
Europe divided into two hostile camps.
The First and Second Hague Conferences
(1899 and 1907) failed to achieve anything
concrete on the issue of armament reduction.
The Court of Arbitration set up at Hague to deal
with inter-state conflicts also proved futile. The
armament race and military build-ups by the
European powers, in anticipation of this war,
continued at a frenzied pace.
<br>
<br>
In the end, on one side stood a united
Germany, already the most powerful land power
militarily and economically, allied with the large
and outwardly confident empire of AustriaHungary as also with Italy. On the other side
stood France, bitter in enmity over its defeat and
loss of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany in 1871,
seeking security by allying with Russia in 1892
and forming an ‘entente cordiale’ with its
traditional rival Great Britain in 1904.
Both sides amassed armaments, which were
becoming more lethal as advancing technologies
of explosives, metal design, petroleum fuel, and
shipbuilding were applied to them. Military chiefs
(notably Alfred Von Schlieffen of Germany)
planned strategies that relied on swift
mobilization, rapid offensive strike, and inevitable
escalation, which compressed the time for
political decision making and diplomatic control
of crises. Newspapers stimulated feelings of
danger, deprivation, and patriotism in public
opinion, which came to think of war as possible,
even desirable.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>World War 1 Begins</i></strong></div>

Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on
28th July, 1914. Germany declared a war on
Russian on 1st August and on France on 3rd
August. Belgium was invaded by German forces
on the same day and France was invaded on 4th
August. German violation of Belgium neutrality
gave the British a convenient excuse to enter the
war on the side of France and Russia. British
world-wide interests made the war a global
conflict, drawing into it the dominions of
Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa
and the greatest British colonial possession, India,
and later the United States, because of close British
links with it.
<br>
<br>
Austria-Hungry attacked Russia on 6th
August and France and Britain declared war on
Austria-Hungary on 12th August. Italy,
diplomatically aligned with Austria and
Germany since the Triple Alliance of 1882,
declared its neutrality on 3rd August. In the
following months it was avidly pursued by France
and Britain. On 23rd May 1915, the Italian
government succumbed to allied temptations and
declared war on Austria-Hungary in pursuit of
territorial expansion.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Trench Warfare</i></strong></div>

Expectations that war will be swift and short
were belied. Soon, it got deadlocked into
positional trench warfare along the Western
Front; a massive seize of 600 miles from
Switzerland to the North Sea. This continuous
front marked the end of local, small, isolated
and restricted warfare. Now millions of men faced
each other across the sand-bagged, parapets of
trenches, under which they lived like, and with
rats and lice. The opposing systems of zigzag,
timber-revitts, sand-bag reinforced trenches were
fronted by tangles of barbed wire and scattered
covered dugouts for providing shelter for troops.
The heavy artillery and machine gun fire used
by the opposing armies made it almost impossible
to achieve any breakthrough. In order to break
the stalemate, each side tried to expand its warproduction. This necessitated total mobilization
of human and industrial resources. e.g. The battle
of Verdun (February-July, 1916) in which the
Germans attempted a breakthrough was a battle
of 2 millions, with one million casualties. The
British offensive on the Somme, designed to force
the Germans to break off the Verdun offensive
cost Britain 420,000 lives.
<br>
<br>
In this battle, British artillery was provided
with 23,000 tons of projectiles whereas the French
Artillery in the celebrated battle of Waterloo had
used only 100 tons. Karl von Clausewitz, the
philosopher of war had defined War as "an act
of violence pushed to its utmost bounds". The
phrase 'home front' acquired wider usage during
World War I. The supply line of opponent became
the first natural target of military strategy. The
economic warfare was symbolized by naval
blockade and unrestricted submarine warfare
during World War I.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Naval Blockade</i></strong></div>

The Allies attempted naval blockade on the
Central Powers (Germany, Austria, Hungry) and
their co-belligerents Turkey and Bulgaria. The
blockade proved unsuccessful as the Central
Powers continued to get their supplies through
neutral countries. Germany launched attacks on
Allied commercial shipping in October, 1914
through its submarines-the-U-boats. Such attacks
intensified in 1915-1917. By mid-1915, average
monthly sinking of Allied ships was 116,000 gross
tones and touched 866,000 tonnes by April, 1917.
However, the political disadvantages outweighed
any logistical damage, since there was strong
American reaction to these sinking.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Technological Innovations</i></strong></div>

By the end of the nineteenth century, black
powder was supplanted by nitrocellulose based
propellants popularly known as 'gun-cotton'.
Alfred Krupp (1851) built an all steel gun drilled
out of a single block of cast metal. Breech-loading
mechanism used in 1860s and 1870s helped in
cutting spiral grooves into the bores of artillery
pieces or solved the problem of rifling. Its
advantages were immense. By imparting spin to
the projectiles, rifling produced greater accuracy.
Another technical device solved the recoiling
problem by absorbing the shock of discharge and
leaving the gun in approximately same position
after firing as before. The trench warfare of
World War I gave an impetus to the production
of heavier guns in greater number with longer
ranges and better fire-control. Shooting became
based on map coordinates and carefully
calculated ballistic parameters without a forward
observer. Artillery communications also improved
aided by field telephones and radios.
The World War I witnessed development of
heavy machine-guns. The first successful
automatic machine-gun was invented by Hiram
Stevens Maxim. These were first used by the
British army in 1895. After 1915, lighter machine-
guns such as British Lewis guns, French
Chauchat and US Browning automatic rifle
(BAR) were used for greater mobility and
portability. In 1918, a German named Louis
Schmeisser first developed a sub machinegun.
Some new forces of mechanized warfare such
as tanks, aircrafts (fighter and bombers),
submarines, aircraft carriers were discovered
during World War I but their destructive potential
was realized only in the Second World War. First
tanks- 'Little Willie' and 'Big Willie' were designed
in Britain in 1915. French developed the
Schneider. Submarines became a major factor in
World War I. Germany employed U-Boats to
destroy surface merchant ships by using a selfpropelled underwater missile or torpedo. German
Zeppelins were early military aircraft used during
World War I. Their use did not prove very
effective.
<br>
<br>
Germany used chlorine along a six kilometers
front at Ypres on 22 April 1915 against French
and Algerian Territorial Army. Later phosgene
and mustard gas were also used during the
World War I. However, introduction of better
gas masks, protective clothing reduced the effects
of chemical warfare.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>End of War</i></strong></div>

The ‘Great War’, as it was known before the
Second World War made this the First, carried
on for more than four years, with neither side
on any front willing to accept defeat or negotiate
peace. The Russian Revolution of 1917 brought
a cease-fire on the eastern front in December
with Russia losing substantial territory and
monies to Germany in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk.
The US declared war on Germany only on April
6, 1917 but the entry of American troops, aero
plans and fresh supplies in 1918 nullified German
gains on both fronts. An armistice was declared
on November 11, 1918 and a peace conference
opened in Paris on 18 January 1919.
<br>
<br>
In the World War I, the total number of
people killed and dead for other war-related
reasons was well over 8 million. It was also an
age of mass flight. The aftermath of World War
I saw a large number of homeless and stateless
people, including the two millions who fled from
the Russian Revolution and accompanying civil
strife. 13 million Greeks were repatriated to
Greece mainly from Turkey. In all, the period
1914-22 created roughly 4-5 million refugees. A
new document, a certificate delivered by national
authorities on the recommendations of League
of Nations High Commissioners for Refugees in
1920s, the so-called 'Nansen passport' was
accepted as a travel document by over 50
countries.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Post War Developments</i></strong></div>

US President Woodrow Wilson was a
dominating figure of the peace conference so that
his moralistic ‘fourteen points’ were incorporated
into the resulting treaties, which transformed the
map of Europe on the principle of ‘selfdetermination of nations’, and established a
League of Nations to uphold the peace on the
principle of ‘collective security’.
Germany was punished territorially and
financially. Alsace-Lorraine was restored to
France. The port of Danzig was made a free city
and a Polish Corridor ran through the eastern
provinces of Germany. Rearmament of any kind
was forbidden, as was fortification of the
Rhineland or union with Austria. Colonial
possessions were detached and unspecified
amounts demanded in reparations.
The Habsburg Dynasty was dismissed and
its Austria-Hungary Empire dismantled.
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland became
independent. Austria ceded South Tyrol, Istria,
the Dalmatian, coast and some Adriatic Islands
to Italy, and its southern Slav provinces of
Slovenia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina to Yugoslavia. Other territorial
transfers took from Bulgaria and added to
Romania. The Ottoman Empire too was abolished
with the Treaty of Sevres, 1920; Turkey became
a republic, its Arab provinces were placed under
British/French mandate.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Outcome of the War</i></strong></div>

Territorial changes failed to solve the basic
problems of insecurity in Europe, dividing the
continent into ‘satisfied’ but weakened powers
such as Britain, and dissatisfied or revisionist
states, including Germany and Russia. The
economic consequences of the peace compounded
the high cost of the war to cause inflation and
unemployment, undermine currencies, and
disrupt trading patterns, leading to the Great
Depression of the 1930s. At the core of a complex
process lay the problem of allied war debts to
the US. A weak League of Nations could take no
effective action against Japan in 1931, Italy in
1935, or Nazi Germany in successive violations
of the Treaty. All this ultimately led to World
War 2.
<br>
<br>
Versailles conference was dominated by three
major actors: President Woodrow Wilson of the
United States, Georges Clemenceau of France and
Lloyd George of Britain. The real debate was
between Wilson's liberal vision over the post-war
settlement and Clemenceau's nationalist
insistence on extracting harsh terms from
Germany.
<br>
<br>
Wilson's vision was a broader one. His
Fourteen Points stressed the ideals of selfdetermination, sovereignty and justice. Wilson's
idea was to provide for a new programme stability
for the modern state system. While Wilson's was
a liberal programme speaking of a new world
order, world government (the League of Nations),
Lenin's was a radical cry to overturn the old
state system through a world revolution.
The harshness with which the victors treated
Germany, and the unwillingness to give freedom
to the colonies gave considerable weight to Lenin
and the Bolshevik's assertion that World War I
was essentially a war among imperial powers to
re-divide the world among themselves.
