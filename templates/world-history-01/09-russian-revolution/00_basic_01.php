<h3>Russian Revolution</h3>


The Russian Revolution took place in 1917,
during the final phase of World War I. It removed
Russia from the war and brought about the
transformation of the Russian Empire into the
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR),
replacing Russia’s traditional monarchy with the
world’s first Communist state. The revolution
happened in stages through two separate coups,
one in February and one in October. The new
government, led by Vladimir Lenin, could solidify
its power only after three years of civil war,
which ended in 1920.
<br>
<br>
Although the events of the Russian Revolution
happened abruptly, the causes may be traced
back nearly a century. The Russian Revolution
of 1917 centers around two primary events: the
February Revolution and the October Revolution.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conditions for Revolution</i></strong></div>

First socialist revolution was made in
'backward' Russia, a society that was capitalist
with strong remnants of feudal social and
economic power intact, a working class still linked
with land, and a peasantry that primarily aspired
to individual land ownership. Essentially, it was
the increasing contradictions of late and growing
capitalism that created the social premises for
the revolutionary outbreaks in Russia.
In Western Europe the growth of capitalism
had led to the evolution of liberalconstitutionalism and parliamentary democracies.
The Russian autocracy oppressed all the other
nationalities of the Empire, and stood firmly
against all democratic movements in Europe,
earning for itself the label 'Policeman of Europe'.
The nature of the Russia state, therefore, became
increasingly incompatible with the new demands
that the new and changing social and economic
forces engendered.
<br>
<br>
Serfdom was abolished in 1861. Even as
peasant agriculture became commercialized and
there emerged a 'kulak' rich peasant strata, the
fundamental conflict in the countryside on the
urgent questions of land, rents, wages and rights
over commons remained that between the landed
aristocracy, which still held the major portion of
the land, and the peasantry as a whole.
Expropriation of landed estates and land for the
peasants was a demand that neither the Tsarist
autocracy nor any other political group, except
the Bolshevik, was prepared to endorse. At the
same time, timing and nature of Russian
industrialization also created scope for a workers
movement that was both very militant and
political.
<br>
<br>
Freedom from national oppression in the
Tsarist Empire coincided with the victory of the
socialist revolution. Apart from the alienation felt
by the peoples of the Baltic region, Central Asia,
Transcaucasia and other areas as a result of
political and cultural discrimination, the
economic backwardness that Tsarist economic
policies entailed for these regions ensured that
they remain predominantly agricultural with a
strong stake in the land question.
The Bolsheviks supported land for the peasant
as well as the right to secession and a voluntary
union. The peasantry in these areas, therefore,
played a crucial role in the victory of the socialist
alternative to the tsarist autocracy, completely
bypassing all liberal solutions to nationalist
aspirations.
<br>
<br>
<b>The Russian Revolution:</b> In Stages
Lenin was the most important leader of the
Bolshevik party. The Bolsheviks did not simply
transfer Marxism to Russia. They found viable
answers to their specific revolutionary
problematic in Russia within the framework of
Marxism. The 'hegemony of the working class'
was necessary in the first bourgeois-democratic
stage of the revolutionary, strategy was the
'alliance of the working class and the peasantry'
in the context of a two stage revolution and the
leading role of the working class, while
transforming their strategy to bring them about.
<br>
<br>
The Russian Revolution may be said to have
gone through three distinct stage and took almost
twelve years to complete. The first stage led to
the creation of a parliament, called the Duma.
The second stage, known as the February
revolution in 1917, led to the establishment of a
Provisional Government at the centre though the
rule of the tsar still prevailed. Finally, the
Revolution completed its third and final stage in
October 1917 when the rule of the tsar was
overthrown and a peoples' republic was
established.
The first major assault on the autocracy
occurred in 1905, sparked off by firing on a
peaceful demonstration of workers on 9 January
1905. This day came to be known as Bloody
Sunday. The workers and peasants began to
demand a 'democratic republic'. They also created
the first soviets, grass-root, elected political
organizations of workers, peasants and soldiers,
which Lenin later called the 'embryos of
revolutionary power' and which eventually
formed the basis of the post revolutionary state,
and from which the socialist state derived its
name USSR.
<br>
<br>
The February Revolution of 1917 began with
a demonstration of women workers over shortage
of bread in Petrograd. Later, it spread to other
cities and to the countryside. Strikes by all sections
of society, peasant uprisings, and revolutionary
action by the soldiers sealed the fate of the
autocracy. The Russian autocracy was
overthrown and replaced by a provisional
Government dominated by the liberal bourgeoisie.
The Revolution achieved political freedom for
the first time. Fundamental and civil rights were
created. New post-February revolution regime
could not continue for long. The peasants were
disappointed that they did not get any land, and
the entire working people and soldiers were
disappointed that the war still continued. The
Bolsheviks easily emerged as closest to the popular
mood with their slogans of: Land for the peasant,
immediate end to war, Workers' control over
industries, Right of nationa-lities to selfdetermination, and above all Bread.
Early Changes
The early legislation aimed at destroying the
legal and economic bases of capitalism and in
laying the foundation for socialism. One of earliest
measures was the abolition of private resources
in industry, and the establishment of workers'
control. A second major intervention was in
agriculture. By the Land Decree of November
1917 landlordism was abolished, and the entire
land nationalized and given over to peasants for
hereditary use under individual production. The
land communities, the village gatherings and
peasant soviets acted as autonomous organs of
social and political transformation in the
countryside. Within the space of a few years
millions of acres of land changed hands and was
divided among the peasants.
<br>
<br>
On 28 December 1917 all private banks were
nationalized, and in February 1918 all
shareholders in banks expropriated and all
foreign debts repudiated. Within a few months
of the revolution the government published all
the secret treaties of the old government, and
proclaimed that all treaties and agreements
between Soviet Russia and other countries will
be open and public.
By Decree on Peace, peace was offered
without any annexations, conquests or
indemnities. Govt. withdrew claims over areas;
took a public stand against colonialism, and in
support of all national liberation struggles.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>War Communism</i></strong></div>

Then, this entire process of revolutionary
change was brought to a crisis by mid-1918. The
revolutionary forces were confronted by Civil war
in the form of armed hostility of the forces of the
former landed aristocracy and the bourgeoisie,
which merged with an equally determined armed
intervention by the capitalist countries to dislodge
the new socialist regime. The Bolsheviks
responded in Jun 1918 with a series of economic
and political measures that have subsequently
been designated as War Communism. Loss of
economically rich resource areas during war, and
the emphasis on production for war effort and
machinery to broaden the production base, led
to decline in production of consumer goods.
The Soviet Government responded with
forced requisition of grain surplus from the
peasants in order to feed the urban poor and
soldiers, and state control of all enterprises in
order to revive industry. Nationalization of
industrial enterprises was accelerated for
maximum mobilization of resources. By a March
1918 decision the railways were taken away from
'workers' control and place under semi-military
command. While the failure on the economic front
led to peasant wars and urban disaffection, the
growth of black market encouraged an ethos
inimical to socialist ideals.
<br>
<br>
The spirit of voluntarism came under severe
strain even as the 'world socialist revolution' in
Europe failed to materialize. Recruitment for the
Red Army became a problem. Workers opposition
to the principle of sate control and the uprising
of kronstadt sailors in February 1921 was the
final straw after the wide spread peasant
rebellions. Lenin was forced to announce that
change of policy had become necessary.
NEP
The New Economic Policy (NEP) was a
response to a political and economic crisis, though
at its core were economic changes that marked
a change in the strategy of transition to socialism.
Grain requisition was replaced by a fixed tax. In
1924 the tax in kind was replaced by a money
tax, followed by legalization of private trade. On
17 May 1921 the decree nationalizing small scale
industry was revoked and smaller units were
actually de-nationalized, some of them being
restored to their former owners.
Just as War Communism had enabled the
Bolsheviks to tide over the immediate difficulties
and to consolidate the Revolution, the NEP (New
Economic Policy) changes made possible
economic recovery in the ensuing years and also
won the confidence of the majority of peasants.
However, potential for conflict again between
town and country, the peasant and working class
remained in a long term sense. Reason was that
private sector was predominant in agriculture
throughout NEP, and a lot of industry was still
a state monopoly. NEP changes could not resolve
the problems and social contradictions that
derived not merely from the war situation or
specific polices but from the larger social
contradictions that arise when the revolutionary
working class is called upon to build socialism in
the midst of a vast peasant majority.
The early socialist state heroically
experimented with guaranteeing full employment, free and equal education for all, free
healthcare, equal access to culture and cultural
advance, and equality for women.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Internationalism</i></strong></div>

For the Bolsheviks the Russian revolution was
always inseparable from the world socialist
revolution. This, together with the cardinal
Marxist principle of the unity of the interests of
working classes all over the world, and their
socialist vision of an oppression-free world, was
the basis of their internationalism. This
internationalism was given shape in the form of
the Socialist international.
When the social-democratic parties of
Western Europe refused to oppose their own
ruling classes in the interest of the working classes
in Europe, as the Bolsheviks saw it, the Bolsheviks
broke away from them, changed their name to
communist party, and accordingly formed a new
Communist International. Initially, for the
Bolshevik their revolution had to spread
elsewhere, as, backward Russia did not have the
productive capacity to sustain advanced
socialism. However, it was Russia that gave the
first Socialist State.
<br>
<br>
The Communist International was envisaged
as the vanguard of internationalism of revolution.
As soon as the Bolsheviks proclaimed in
November 1917 the right to secession as part of
self determination, the Allied powers made this
issue a part of their armed intervention. The
Comintern, at this stage modified their right to
be that of the workers and peasants in the
different areas. It developed the idea of a United
Front between national liberation movements and
the Communist Parties in Europe and Soviet Russia.
The strategy of the communists in these areas
was strongly influenced by the Comintern, where
the national-liberation struggles were seen as not
only against the imperialist powers and the feudal
landlords in their own country, but also against
the bourgeoisie in their own country. The agrarian
revolution was seen as the basis of the national
liberation struggles with the workers playing the
leading role.
<br>
<br>
In the 1920s as the Bolshevik's struggle with
their peasantry seemed muted with the NEP
changes, a similar accommodation occurred in
the Comintern policy towards the co-relation of
social forces in the national liberation struggles.
The Comintern recognized and supported the
'positive' role of the bourgeoisie in these countries
against Imperialism. This policy continued well
into the 1920s and Communist Parties were
formed in many Asian countries. The links with
China were particularly strong, and early
strategies of the communist groups in China,
India, Turkey and Afghanistan were strongly
influenced by Comintern polices. Communist
members of these countries were also represented
in Comintern.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Planning for Industrialization</i></strong></div>

Soviet economic development from 1926 to
1941 constitutes the first global attempt at
comprehensive state planning and is therefore
important in the history of world
industrialization. Marxists like the Soviet
Bolsheviks had always believed in 'planning' of
the economy. Marx had argued that a socialist
society would be free of the arbitrary control of
market forces, or the self-interested control of
the capitalist class to maximize profit. Instead
socialist society would control resources directly
and plan production to meet the real needs of
the people.
<br>
<br>
As the dominant Soviet leader Stalin became
more and more impatient with the rates of growth
within the market economy of the NEP, careful
planning gave way to the demands of polities.
Instead of a planned economy running according
to carefully formulated estimates of economically
practicable targets, there appeared a 'command'
economy, running according to the political orders
and priorities of the government.
Stalin nursed certain obsessions that were
detrimental to planning as a process of balanced
and realistic economic growth. Demand to build
gigantic industrial complexes on a scale beyond
the available resources to construct or operate.
This obsession was accompanied by an
unrelenting insistence on haste, captured in the
slogan, "tempos decide the whole thing." The
First Plan had mixed results. Consumer goods,
agriculture and, temporarily, military strength
were sacrificed to a rapid growth in heavy
industry.
<br>
<br>
In the decade after 1928, Soviet industry
developed at a rate and on a scale entirely
without precedent in world economic history.
Industrial production in 1937 reached 446 per
cent of the 1928 level according to official Soviet
figures, and 249 per cent according to the most
conservative Western estimate; the corresponding
annual per cent rates of growth were 18 and 10.5.
While the state had succeeded in extending
and consolidating control over the greater part
of industry by nationalization, the predominance
of private peasant farms meant that production
and marketing decisions in agriculture remained
beyond central planning and therefore state
control. Lenin had argued that the government
would have to gradually persuade peasants to
give up their private farms and join together in
collective farms. This would have to be done by
providing peasants with modern equipment,
credit and agronomic support. During the 1920s
agronomists and land-consolidation experts
occasionally succeeded in persuading the
households involved in the consolidation of
landholdings divided into strips to set themselves
up as collective farms. But such collective farms
tended to be small and few. Peasant farming
methods and technology under NEP had
remained extremely backward. The small size
and fragmentation of farms prevented modern
farming methods and the use of better
implements. One third of land was not sown at
any given time. Although grain production had
recovered to pre-war levels by the mid-1920s,
much less grain was marketed in the 1920s than
before the First World War. This was partly a
consequence of the increase in rural population.
The problem for the state was to attract a greater
share of the marketed harvest to its own
collection agencies rather than to private traders.
Despite a good harvest in the autumn of
1927, peasant marketing and state procurement
of grain fell far below expectation to a level that
was insufficient to feed the towns and the army,
and export grain in order to pay for the import
of machinery. If the state had chosen to raise its
procurement prices for grain, to match private
market prices, funds available for industrial
expansion would have suffered.
<br>
<br>
The rapid rise in industrial investment during
1927-28 was a major factor leading to the grain
crisis from October 1927. Consumer goods
became even more scarce(the "goods famine") as
investment shifted to heavy industry; and, they
cost more to buy as state procurement prices for
grain remained low.
In answer to this goods famine, the peasant
went on what the regime called a "production
strike" by refusing to market at state-determined
prices the quotas of grain set by the state. Instead,
the peasants chose either to sell to private traders
at higher prices or to meet their tax obligations
by selling higher priced industrial crops or
livestock products.
<br>
<br>
Soviet leaders faced two alternatives. They
could continue with the New Economic Policy
balanced industrialization, gradual collectivization, and adjust agricultural delivery prices to
induce the peasants to market more grain; this
was the policy advocated by leaders like
Bukharin. Or they could institute a radical new
policy of accelerated collectivization and forced
industrialization. Stalin opted for the second
alternative.
<br>
<br>
The peasants met forced collectivization with
large-scale passive resistance and sporadic armed
resistance. Rather than hand over their animals,
to the Kolkhoz, many peasants slaughtered them,
the attack on the peasant economy was
accompanied by a fierce campaign against the
Orthodox Church, the centre of traditional
peasant culture. In March 1930, in an article
called "Dizzy with Success", Stalin blamed local
officials for excesses he had authorized. He called
for a temporary halt the collectivization drive
resumed but with clearer guidelines this time.
Tens of thousands of communists and urban
workers were urgently mobilized to work in the
countryside as Kolkhoz organizers and
Chairmen. Villagers were steadily persuaded or
coerced by discriminatory taxation to return to
the collectives. By 1937, 86 per cent of sown
area had been brought within the Kolkhozes and
collective farms accounted for 89 per cent of the
grain harvest and 87 per cent of grain
procurements by the state. Collectivization,
sometimes called the "Second Revolution",
changed the peasant way of life more radically
than did the Bolshevik Revolution. The fact that
it was not carried out by peasants voluntarily,
but by a largely urban and proletarian Party,
and by force, meant that it was authentically a
'revolution from above'. The lynchpin of the
difference between peasant life before and after
collectivization was that the collective farmer had
no control over the grain and cash crops that
were produced on the collectivized land. His
second need was not only to defeat the opposition
but to attack and root out the source of all
potential opposition and criticism in the
democratic traditions of party leadership. Third
need, was to move from a single-party to a
single-ruler state. "Trial of the Sixteen" (August
1936), "Trial of the Seventeen" (January 1937),
the military chiefs, were arrested, accused of
treasonable collaboration with Germany and
Japan, and shot. It was known as "The Trial of
the Twenty-one" (March 1938). This was only
the tip of the iceberg. The Great Purge decimated
between 35 and 50 per cent of the entire officer
corps of the Soviet armed forces. Most estimates
agree that about five per cent of the population
was imprisoned during the period, making a total
of some eight million persons, of whom perhaps
ten per cent were killed. Three crucial aspects of
the Russian economy and polity between the
period 1928 and 1941: indus-trialization through
planning, collectivization of agriculture and the
purges of the 1930s. Planned industrialization
meant setting targets for industrial production
for a period of five years and systematically going
about achieving the targets. Collectivization of
agriculture stood for a transformation of plots of
agricultural land under individual possession into
large collectives which could be exposed to
modernized farming though state initiative. Large
scale opposition to Stalin's policies both within
and outside the party coupled with a desire to
convert Russia from a single party rule to single
ruler state led to the purges of the 1930s. In
these purges a number of trials took place in
which old Bolsheviks, members of Lenin's
politbureau, a number of army officers and many
state officials were executed. Virtually anyone
who did not agree with Stalin's policies was put
to death. All dissent was suppressed. Whereas
the victims of collectivization were invariably
members of the rural population, the purges of
the 1930s targeted mainly the urban population,
the military and the political elites and the
educated sections of the population.
