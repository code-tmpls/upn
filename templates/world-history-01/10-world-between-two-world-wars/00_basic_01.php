<h3>World Between Two World Wars</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Security Threats</i></strong></div>

The League of Nations was Wilson's great
internationalist project for the new era. The
League was to provide the foundations for order
in the post-war scenario, to remake the
international state system which had been
successively undermined by conflicts among
European powers. The league's main project was
'collective security'. But in reality, different
countries in Europe perceived their security needs
differently. For instance, Britain perceived Soviet
Russia to be the main enemy, France saw the
main threat from the neighbouring Germany.
French moved towards a policy of
bilateralism and concluded a series of
independent pacts with states surrounding
Germany. Locarno treaties of 1925 were born
out of a previous German request that France
and Germany conclude a pledge of not resorting
to war between each other, something which
would also involve Britain and Belgium. By 1925
the British agreed to guarantee such a treaty,
which would also include the Belgium-German
frontier. The sum total of the Locarno treaties
was as follows: Britain would guarantee the
frontier of Belgium against future (German)
aggression while France would do the same in
the east-protecting Poland and Czechoslovakia.
Germany would join the League of Nations.
The Locarno treaties were followed up by
the Kellog-Briand pact of 1928 also known as
the Pact of Paris. The pact was universal in scope
and the signatories renounced the use was as an
instrument of international relations. Ultimately
Sixty Five States signed the treaty.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economic Crisis</i></strong></div>

To a great degree, the 'recovery' in Europe in
the years after World War I was built almost
entirely on US loans. The process also ensured a
constant supply of liquidity back to US lenders.
To take an example, the US lent money to
Germany in the 1920s for her recovery. In turn
Germany passed on money to the French and
the British as part of reparation payments. The
French and the British for their part re-routed
money back to the US as part of repayment for
war loans. The world economy was flush with
money supply, most of it US-dominated. The
atmosphere was ripe for speculation.
<br>
<br>
The crisis actually began over the rapid drop
in agricultural prices in North America. With
European recovery the world agricultural surplus
began to rise, and the North American producers
(who had vastly increased production during the
war period) were convulsed by rapid drop in
prices. Bankruptcies began in US agriculture and
saw a rapid drop in expenditure. It was only a matter
of time before the stock market would be affected.
The actual events began to unfold in October
1929. On 24th and 29th of October 1929, thirteen
and sixteen and a half million shares were sold.
In that month US investors lost 40 billion dollars,
a huge sum at that time. The meltdown had
begun. The crash was followed by the worldwide fall in agricultural prices. Given the fairly
advanced integration of the world economy for
agricultural products, millions of primary
producers were affected.
This crisis had earlier been predicted by
writers like Karl Marx who had spoken about
the cyclical nature of capitalism: how its chaotic
and unplanned character would lead to periodic
crises of over-productions. In fact, the tendency
towards over-production in capitalism is blamed
by many writers for its cyclic nature.
 However none of the previous downturns
of the world economy had such serious
consequences as that beginning in 1929. The
downturn of 1871 was significant in that it
undermined British hegemony in the worldeconomy, but in no way did world-wide
depression occur. The only country that was
relatively unaffected by the crisis was the Soviet
Union.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fascism</i></strong></div>

Fascism emerged in Europe as a synthesis of
organic nationalism and anti-Marxist socialism.
Organic nationalism means a belief in the
harmonious collectivity of Nations superseding
all other forms of human identification. Its organic
nationalism accounts for its deep-rooted hostility
to internationalism and organizations and
movements based on internationalism such as
communism, freemasonry, the League of Nations,
finance capital and the multi-national Jewish
community.
<br>
<br>
Fascism emerged as a radical movement based
on the rejection of nations of liberalism,
democracy and Marxism. The Fascist synthesis
symbolized the rejection of a political culture
inherited from the Enlightenment and its ideas
such as rationalist materialism, individualism and
pluralist autonomy.
The other major cultural variables of fascism
were: activism, vitality and social-darwinism.
Sorel's philosophy of action was based on
intuition, energy and elan. Its activism was used
to mobilize the masses. Social Darwinism believed
that people in society compete for survival and
only superior groups and races succeed.
The war did provide sociological and
psychological conditions for the crystallization
of Fascism. It revealed the capacity of nationalism
in the mobilization of masses and economic
resources. It further demonstrated the importance
of unity of command, of authority, of moral
mobilization and of propaganda in the service of
the modern state. Its perfect expression being
the quasi-sacred figure of the leaders like the
Duce (as in Italy) or the Fuehrer (as in Germany).
A party militia was often used to reinforce
the sense of nationalism and constant struggle
as well as to wipe out opposition. The exaltation
of youth and the specific tendency towards an
authoritarian, charismatic, personal style of
command (whether elective or non-elective) were
other features related to this militarization of
politics.
<br>
<br>
The ideas of corporatism (as a community of
people, of producers free from class strife)
emerged in reaction to individualism, social
atomization and new centralizing states. Its two
distinct forms were societal corporatism (based
on autonomy to corporations) and state
corporatism. At the same time it also made use
of anti-semitism and an embryonic militant group
of young activists.
Another trend toward the crystallization of
the fascist right was symbolized by an
instrumental, modernizing radical right which
combined domestic modernization with militant
nationalism. It is important to understand the
ideological range that is covered by the rightwing regimes. All of them are not similar, and
can cover a broad spectrum starting from
conservative regimes to extreme fascist ones.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fascism in Italy</i></strong></div>

Fascism in Italy was created by the
convergence of certain existing trends. The split
in the radical syndicates Confederation of Trade
Unions took place in 1914 over the issue of Italian
participation in the war. The syndicates believed
in the 'self-emancipation' of the 'producers',
which could be achieved through 'regulation at
factory level', and not through 'seizure of state
power'. The state would be replaced at an
appropriate time by worker's syndicates or
associations, which would act as the instruments
of self-government of the producers.
The Syndicate wing which moved towards
fascism embraced extreme nationalism, and
nations were described by it in class terms as
proletarian or plutocratic. The futurists who
rejected traditional norms and existing institutions
and exalted violence, and were fascinated
by speed, power, motors and machines, or all
the modern technological possibilities, were
another major ideological factor. Mussolini's
socialistic views, and ideas on leadership, massmobilization and national revolution contributed
yet another strand.
<br>
<br>
The growth of fascist squads led by ex-military
personnel and supported by the local police and
army especially in northern and central Italythe Po Valley and Tuscany was directly linked
to the actual or perceived threat of the left. The
King appointed Mussolini as the Prime Minister
on 29th October 1922, who temporarily observed
all the constitutional norms after the assumption
of power.
In February 1923, a fusion of Fascist Party
and Nationalist Association of Italy (ANI) took
place. This fusion with a conservative, elitist,
monarchist right-wing was essential to gain
broader support among army officers, academics,
civil servants and businessmen. The traditional
right groups co-operated with fascists in passing
the Acerbo Bill in 1923 which proposed that the
party receiving a quarter of votes in an election,
should be automatically given two-thirds of seats
in the parliament.
<br>
<br>
Using force and fraud, Fascists swept the
1924 election. Mussolini went ahead with his
institutionalization of dictatorship. In October
1926, all opposition parties were banned. The
press was shackled, and the Public Safety Law
(1926) made the security of state take precedence
over personal liberty. The Syndical Laws (1926)
brought labour under the control of state, in the
interest of production. The law confirmed the
fascist unions in their monopoly of negotiations,
set up tribunals for compulsory arbitration and
banned strikes and go-slows.
The 'Corporate State' was formally created
in 1934 with 22 new combined corporations of
employers and employees, Mussolini also tried
to appease the church. Large grants were made
for the repair of war damaged churches. In 1923,
religious education was made compulsory in
secondary schools.
A military type Militia developed out of the
fascist squads. It was trained to use all kinds of
weapons and centered around a core of professional soldiers. Its cadres were indoctrinated and
used against opponents. The semi-military
propaganda-type organization included Balilla,
young vanguards and the young fascists.
However, unlike the Nazi German state,
Fascism in Italy never achieved a day-to-day
institutional control. The state intervention in the
economic life of the nation was marginal in the
early part or regime. The Direct state investment
during the Depression was only an emergency
measure. The Fascist State also introduced certain
welfare schemes for workers in 1930s. e.g. family
allowances were given in 1934.
<br>
<br>
The Italian state also lacked any policy of
racial anti-Semitism, at least, up to 1937. In
November 1938, however, under the influence
of Nazis, racial laws were passed which banned
marriage with Jews, denied jobs to them in public
services, debarred them from joining the Fascist
Party and from owning more than 50 hectares
of land.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Dictatorship in Spain</i></strong></div>

The first phase of authoritarian government
in Spain was established during 1923-30 by
General Miguel Primo de Rivera. It emerged as a
kind of military reaction to the socialist pressure
for democratic reforms and above all the attempt
of Spanish Parliament to fix 'responsibilities' for
disastrous military campaign in Morocco. Initially
the overthrow of the Spanish Cortes or parliament
was intended to be a temporary step. But a
dictatorship was institutionalized gradually.
The demise of Rivera's dictatorship
inaugurated a new phase of mass democracy
and led to the radicalization of Spanish politicsalong both left and right lines. CEDA or the
Confederation of Spanish Right groups was the
main conservative authoritarian party during
1933-36. Its youth movement (JAP) underwent a
certain vertigo of fascistization but remained
ambivalent.
<br>
<br>
The failure of militant nationalistic ideology
in Spain stemmed partially from the influence of
intense regional nationalism (or sub-nationalism)
of Catalans and Basques, directed against the
unified Spanish nation-state. Moreover, Spanish
Civil war (1936-39) produced a polarized
revolutionary-counter revolutionary conflict in
which leadership passed completely in the hands
of the insurgent Nationalist Army which created
the Franco regime.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fascism in Germany</i></strong></div>

The regime that took over in Germany in 1933
represented the most extreme form of fascism.
Crisis of parliamentary democracy in Germany
in the 1920s created conditions for the rise of fascism.
In the realm of ideology, there were strong
precursors to the doctrines of the Nazi era.
Racialism and imperialism were powerful themes
in the aspirations of the Wilhelmine German elite,
for whom the phrase Weltpolitik signified their
search for great-power status and a world
mission. In Vienna, the Christian Socialist mayor
combined social and administrative reform with
virulent scapegoating of the Jews for all social
ills. The repeated attempts by the communist to
bring about a soviet-like seizure of power
sharpened tensions, spread fear among the
middle classes and conservative elements, and
contributed to an atmosphere of extreme
polarization.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>German Politics & Failure of Weimar
Republic</i></strong></div>

The Weimar Republic underwent a crisis in
1922-23. The collapse of the monetary system
resulted in hyperinflation, with one pound
exchanging for 15 million marks in September
1923. In January 1923 the French army occupied
the Ruhr in response of Germany's defaulting on
reparations payments. There was high
unemployment, far too great a dependence on
foreign investment and stagnation in German
agriculture. Political instability was endemic,
with no single party majorities, as many as 15
ministries between 1919 and 1928.
The Weimar Republic refers to the political
system that came into place in Germany after
World War I and continued till the Nazi takeover in 1933. The name comes from the town of
Weimar in Germany were the Republic's
constitution was promulgated. The threat from
revolutionary socialism, which became the
Communist Party, was to be a constant feature
in the Weimar period till the rise of the Nazis.
Stresemann was the most important political
leader in the country. He vigorously opposed the
French occupation of Germany's Ruhr valley. He
got the Dawes plan of 1924 for the economic
reconstruction of Germany ratified in the
Reichstag of Parliament. He gained German
admission to the League of Nations in 1926, and
also encouraged and helped stimulate German
economic recovery by rationalizing German
industry through a series of cartels, and an
aggressive export drive.
<br>
<br>
Despite all efforts, Weimar experiment
collapsed under the weight of the economic crisis
after 1929. The Wall Street Crash of October 1929
had a terrible impact on Germany, with the
withdrawal of American loans, loss of export
markets, and collapse of industrial production.
Unemployment rose to 5.6 million in 1932. A
series of political intrigues in January 1933 led to
an agreement to a conservative coalition to be
led by Hitler as Chancellor.
There were to be only three Nazis in a twelvemember government, and the conservatives
believed that they could use Hitler to suppress
the left. In a series of ruthless political move Hitler
proved them disastrously wrong, as he
consolidated his hold on power, crushed all real
and potential opposition, and created a highly
centralized state.
<br>
<br>
The Enabling Act (Law for Removing the
Distress of People and Reich) was passed on 23
March 1933. This became the legal basis for
Hitler's dictatorship. Legislative power was
transferred to the executive, politically undesirable
and 'non-Aryan' civil servants dismissed. After
the Reichstag fire of 27 February 1933 a state of
emergency was proclaimed the following day.
On 2 August 1934 Hindenburg died and Hitler
assumed the office of President. Henceforth all
armed forces personnel were required to swear
and oath to the Fuehrer and the Chancellor.
Anton Drexler in Munich founded the
German Workers Party in 1919) In 1920-21 Hitler
has emerged as the leader of the party, which
soon after became the German National Socialist
Worker's Party (NSDAP). On 14 July 1934 the
NSDAP was declared the only political party in
Germany, with attempts at forming other parties
punishable under criminal law. After the
Enabling Act was passed, major changes were
introduced which rapidly altered the juridical
basis of the state.
<br>
<br>
Thus, the legal lights of the Third Reich
proudly proclaimed that "Hitler is the Law", and
produced theories transforming the principle of
the legal state into that of the leader state, or
Fuhrerstaat. The extra-legal notion of the Leader,
to whom the civil service and the Army swore
"unconditional obedience" by "sacred oath",
assumed crucial importance in administrative
functioning and signified a decisive break with
constitutionalism.
The fascist bureaucracy in Germany formally
submitted to the "leader-principle", that is, a
single charismatic leader controlled the entire
movement, the party, and the state.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ascendency of Nazism</i></strong></div>

The new regime's attitude to women and the
family was an admixture of ultra-conservative
patriarchal sentiment and the racialist biological
characteristic of Nazi ideology. The slogan
"Kinder, Kirche, Kuche" (kids, church, kitchen),
became the favourite mode of referring to the
social role of women. The production of "racially
pure" babies became the Nazi's obsession, and
various financial and ideological incentives were
offered to females to give birth to more children.
These incentives ranged from marriage loans and
child subsidies to parents with large families,
towards such as the Honour Cross of the German
Mother in bronze, silver and gold, for mothers of
four, six, and eight children.
<br>
<br>
The Nazis were highly antipathetic to liberal
and cosmopolitan culture. Chambers whose
decisions had the validity of law were set up for
every sphere of cultural life, including the fine
arts, music, theatre, literature, press, radio and
films. The Press was completely controlled by
standing directives and oral instructions issued.
All education from primary school curricula to
university instruction was Nazified, Textbooks
were re-written and Mein Kamf was elevated to
the status of unfailing pedagogical guiding star.
Teachers were required to join the Nazi
Teachers League and swear allegiance to Hitler.
Jews were forbidden to teach. "Racial Science"
was introduced in curricula, which required
teaching the racial theories of the Aryan-German
master race and the Jews as the breeders of all
evil. Hitler was nominally a Catholic. However,
his stance toward the churches of various
denominations was hostile, and at best utilitarian.
Nazi party program spoke of the need for a
"positive Christianity", Within the Protestant
tradition too, there was conflict, but Nazism fed
upon the anti-semitic prejudices of the Lutherans.
(Martin Luther was ferociously anti-Jewish and
a staunch believer in absolute obedience to
authority.) On the whole however, the churches
remained loyal to the regime and fulfilled its
needs by ordering all pastors to swear allegiance
to the Fuehrer. During the war the 30 point
program for the national Reich Church of
Germany outlined Nazi church policy, which
included the elimination of Christian teaching,
the cessation of the publication of the Bible and
the placement on altars of nothing except a copy
of Mein Kampf and a sword.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Genocide</i></strong></div>

The most oppressive aspect of Hitler's regime
was a systematic persecution of the Jews. The
Nuremburg Laws of 15 September 1935 deprived
Jew of German citizenship, confining them to
"subject" status. Marital or extra-marital relations
between Jews and 'Aryans' were forbidden.
Three more laws over the next few years outcast
them completely.
<br>
<br>
The first concentration camps came up in
1933 under the SA. After the Roehm purge of
June 1934, the camps were turned over to the
SS, with guard duty being assigned to the
Death's Head units. Thus did the names such
as Dachau, Auschwitz, and Buchenwald
acquire notority. The actual process of
extermination was begun with the so called
euthanasia practiced on 70,000 mentally infirm
Germans between 1938 and 1941. In late 1941
this method was applied to concentration camp
victims unfit to work- camouflaged gas vans were
employed to gas Jews.
Mass extermination in gas chambers began
in Belzec, in Lublin district of Poland in March
1942. Jewish slave labours were also
systematically machine-gunned. The largest camp
was Auschwitz-Birkenau, where between 2 to 3
million Jews, along with gypsies, Poles, and Soviet
prisoner of war were murdered.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conclusion</i></strong></div>

Fascism has been interpreted in multiple
ways. According to the Marxist position, Fascism
is a violent, dictatorial agent of finance capital.
It has been billed as a unique expression of Middle
Class Radicalism or product of a cultural and
moral breakdown. It was the result of Extreme
Neurotic or pathological impulses.
Some theorists have tried to understand
Fascism as product of the rise of amorphous
masses with the breakdown of traditional
identities based on kinship, church, guild and
residence, etc. and a form of Bonapartism or an
autonomous authoritarian government independent of specific class-domination.
