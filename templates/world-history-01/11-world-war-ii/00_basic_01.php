<h3>World War- II</h3>


The Second World War was a ‘total’ war,
unprecedented in its destruction of military and
non-military assets and people, and truly worldwide in its scope. Its outbreak in Europe in
September 1939 was preceded in August 1937
by the Sino-Japanese War and succeeded in
December 1941 by the entry of the US against
both Japan and Germany.
<br>
<br>
The peace treaties of 1919, coupled with the
Russian Revolution of 1917 and a fundamentally
weak League of Nations, did not resolve the basic
problems of security of Europe. Deep seated
ambitions, fears, insecurities, and mistrust there
were bound to clash politically and militarily in
the absence of habits, institutions, and
mechanisms to facilitate the peaceful resolution
of conflict.
<br>
<br>
Nazi Germany in general and Adolf Hitler
in particular was primarily responsible for the
war and deliberately prepared for it, whether or
not he intended the exact timing of its outbreak
or expected its ultimate scope. Britain and France
were equally responsible for the war because
their leaders had appeased Hitler’s ambitious
demands instead of checking them, had neglected
to build an anti-fascist alliance, and had
encouraged an eastward expansion of Germany
so as to draw the Soviet Union into war.
Germany was penalized by the 1919 peace
treaties but not destroyed; it remained potentially
the strongest power in Europe. Germany
harboured many grievances that some people in
Britain and the US considered legitimate and
was the leading proponent of ‘revisionism’ even
while it strove in the 1920s toward acceptability
in world councils and democracy at home under
the Weimar Constitution. That constitution could
not withstand the strain of coping with economic
depression The Nazi Party had eliminated all
opposition, especially of the Communists and the
Socialists. Hitler led a ‘resurgence’ of Germany
on an explicit ideology of ‘Aryan’ racial purity,
virtue and superiority, reunification by ‘selfdetermination’ of the German race, lebensraum
or ‘living space’ for them, and cancellation of
the 1919 peace treaties.
<br>
<br>
The US was at fault for not participating in
the League, for being isolationist and ambivalent
about Germany in the 1920s and 1930s, and then
for encouraging Britain, France and Poland to
resist without clearly warning Hitler. Poland was
at fault for not forming a common front with
the Soviet Union and then for not submitting
‘peacefully’ to German demands. Mussolini was
blamed for support and encouragement of Hitler,
before joining the Western allies in 1943.
The Soviet Union was responsible for
propagating the idea of an ‘inevitable’ conflict
between communism and capitalism/fascism,
but most of all for entering into a non-aggression
pact with Nazi Germany in August 1939 and so
giving it a ‘green light’ for attack on Poland while
simultaneously annexing several territories itself.
This temporary alliance was reversed when Hitler
ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union on 22
June 1941 and his armies advanced towards
Moscow and other cities before being halted at
Stalingrad in the winter of 1942-43.
In East Asia and the Pacific militarist Japan
took on an aggressive role with all its neighbors
to build on Economic Co-Prosperity Zone,
antagonizing the US, another Pacific Ocean
power that tried to deny Japan access to oil and
other raw materials. When Japan destroyed part
of the US fleet anchored at Pearl Harbour in
Hawaii on 6 December 1941, and Hitler declared
war on the US on 11 December 1941, the US
entered a new global war against both Japan
and Germany, which ended only with their
‘unconditional surrender’ in 1945.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Reasons of World War 2</i></strong></div>

The treaties (of Versailles, Riga, Lausanne,
Locarno, etc.) simply, redrew the map of Europe.
Four great empires, the Russian Romanov, the
Hohenzollern, the Habsburg, and the Ottoman
faced defeat and collapsed. Germany became a
republic, suffering from the stigma of defeat and
burdened by allied reparations. The victorious
western democracies gained territories. France,
for instance, gained Alsace-Lorraine which was
with Germany since 1871. Discontent over the
severity of the Allied peace terms and squabbles
over the newly drawn frontiers contained seeds
of future conflicts.
<br>
<br>
The idea of a world organization for
maintaining peace in the globe was proposed by
Woodrow Wilson, the American President. But
it did not generate much hype as the treaty of
Versailles, the cornerstone of this organizationthe League of Nations-was not ratified even by
America. Moreover, the defeated powers were
also not invited to become members. Germany
was allowed to join the League only in 1926.
League sponsored Disarmament Conference in
Geneva (1932-34) failed to reach any agreement.
Cracks began to appear in global peace in the
early 1930s. The League lacked the executive
powers to impose peaceful solutions. Japanese
Militarism, Italian Fascism and German Nazism
became increasingly strident in their demands.
In 1931, Japanese forces seized Manchuria, a
region of China rich in natural resources, and
made in a puppet state called Manchukuo. Italian
forces invaded Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and
conquered it by May 1936. In Germany, Hitler
started a program of military build-up-in
violation of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.
In March 1936, he notified to the western powers
the existence of a German Air Force (Luftwaffe).
In the same year, Germany and Italy formed an
alliance, called the Rome-Berlin Axis, which was
joined in 1940 by Japan.
<br>
<br>
Germany abrogated the disarmament clauses
of the Treaty in December 1933 and proceeded
to build an army, air force and navy machine
oriented to the future that virtually overran
Europe in 1940-41. Germany recovered the Saar
region by plebiscite in January 1935, overturned
the free city status of Danzig between 1934 and
1936, and remilitarized the Rhineland in March 1936.
Months of negotiations and increasing tension
culminated in a four power conference of Britain,
France, Germany and Italy in Munich on 29
September 1938 renouncing war and permitting
German military occupation of most of
Czechoslovakia.
<br>
<br>
In March 1938, German army moved into
Austria to achieve union (Anschluss) with
Germany. In 1938, Hitler sought the control of
Sudetanland, a region of Western Czechoslovakia
dominated by German speaking people. Britain
wished to preserve peace at all costs, by meeting
Hitler's demands and following a policy of
appeasement.
In September 1938, British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain and French Premier
Daladier agreed to turn over the Sudeten-land
to Germany and forced Czechoslovakia to accept
the agreement (which became known as the
Munich Agreement). The failure of appeasement
soon became clear. Hitler violated the Munich
Agreement in March 1939 and seized the rest of
Czechoslovakia. Similar treatment was meted out
to Poland later on.
<br>
<br>
In Spain in 1936, a 'popular front' of
republicans, socialists, anarchists and syndicates
assumed power. The army leaders and right-wing
parties, socialists, anarchists and syndicates
assumed power. The army leaders and right-wing
parties feared the program of this front and
rebelled under General Franco. The situation thus
became ripe for other world military powers to
show their powers. The divisions were quite
apparent. The Fascist and Nazi regimes provided
military support to General Franco while the
Soviet Union helped the Republicans. The
Republican forces also received "volunteers" from
many countries though liberal democracies
desisted from a direct national participation at
this time.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Division Of World In Ideological Camps</i></strong></div>

In the Second World War, division of the
world into two armed camps followed more or
less same pattern as for the First World War.
Only a few states such as Italy, Japan, Turkey,
and Romania switched their sides Germany, Italy
and Japan (Known as the Axis Powers) were
joined by Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Albania,
Finland and Thailand. The Allied armed camp
mainly consisted of Britain, France, Soviet Union,
Belgium, Denmark, Turkey and the United States.
But more important was the ideological camp
formations.
<br>
<br>
After the World War 1, liberal democracies
re-established their control over the Central
European Empires, helped by reformist,
compromising socialist leaders in many cases.
However, using ultra-nationalist slogans, induced
by economic problems, Fascist and right-wing
dictatorships soon gave a stimulus to establish a
powerful right-wing armed front in countries like
Italy, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Spain
and Japan. These dictatorships arose especially
in countries that lacked traditions of democratic
institutions. The central doctrine of these
variegated dictatorships was the supremacy of
state as opposed to the liberal democratic ideal.
Benito Mussolini established a Fascist regime
in Italy in October 1921 when dissatisfaction with
parliamentary democracy was high, and the
peace settlement was unpopular for having
brought only limited gains. Italy’s territorial
ambitions in southeastern Europe were opposed
by France, an uncompromising upholder of the
Treaty settlement, and Italy’s bit to augment its
north African colonies by occupying Ethiopia in
1935 antagonized Britain as well as created a
crisis in the League of Nations, which was
unwilling to enforce meaningful sanctions against
Italy under Article 16. Mussolini had come to
admire the more efficient Adolf Hitler and signed
a pact with him to create a ‘Berlin-Rome Axis’ in
1936. Their fist collaboration was to assist
militarily General Francisco Franco in
overthrowing a newly formed and fragile
Republic in Spain governed by a left-oriented
coalition called the Popular Front.
<br>
<br>
The spectrum of politics had created three
major hands in the 19th century-left, centre
(liberal democratic) and right (counterrevolutionary). The War put the squeeze on
ideological space (hegemonic space) available
within a state. It tended to homogenize citizens,
within territorially organized states, at least in
their attitudes towards war and national defence
and in demonizing enemy states. The left
spectrum of this divide was mainly inspired by
socialist ideology. Similarly liberal democratic
parties represented the centrist politics of
promoting industrial capitalism in their respective
countries.
Britain, France, America, the main allies in
both wars, had well-established liberal democratic
traditions. Germany, Austria, Italy, Japan,
Hungary lacked such democratic traditions.
Although Japan and Italy helped the Allies in
the First World War, both left them during interwar period itself and with their dictatorial,
authoritarian regimes found their natural allies
(the Central Powers) during World War II.
The Russian autocracy under the Romanovs
supported western democracies owing to
economic compulsions as 25% of investments
from abroad came from France (1914) and
Russian banking, railway development and the
Southern Russian Industrial Complex all
depended on French capital.
<br>
<br>
During World War II, ideological compulsions
again compelled Communist Soviet Union to ally
itself with western liberal democracies against
the danger of extreme right-wing dictatorships
despite inter-war recriminations. The Ottoman
Empire supported the Central Powers during
World War I; however, a democratically reformed
Turkey joined the Allies in the Second World War.
German Constitution of 1871 entrusted
formal sovereignty to a Federal Council
(Bundesrat) whose members were nominated by
the executives of member-states. It also
established a Reichstag or Parliament of 400
deputies elected by a direct, secret, adult male
suffrage. However, there was complete lack of
parliamentary responsibility in this system as the
Imperial Chancellor, appointed by the emperor,
and enjoying enormous powers, was not
accountable to the Reichstag. The German empire,
therefore, emerged as a hybrid of Prussian
military hegemony and imperial federation,
combining modern franchise with ancient
monarchical authority. The Emperor retained
control over the three pillars of absolutism in the
dominant Prussian state, the army, the
bureaucracy and the foreign affairs. Similarly,
the Habsburg monarchy of Austria-Hungary and
the Ottoman Empire were also dominated by
medieval social institutions and military methods.
During the Second World War, liberal
democracies of Britain, France and USA, etc. and
Communist Soviet Union allied together to wipe
out right-wing dictatorships. The outcome in 1945
left the two contending armed camps (Western
democratic camp and Communist camp),
antithetical to each other, reviling each other,
but both with the same end in view, that of,
global domination.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Japanese Aspirations</i></strong></div>

Japan’s modernization drive since the late
19th century led it to graft what it considered
the best of America, Britain, and Germany on to
its own homogenous and disciplined society, to
alliance with Britain in 1902, a victory against
Russia in 1904, the annexation of Korea in 1910,
and a self-image of being the leader of Asia.
Though it received the Shantung province of
China (formerly controlled by Germany) in 1919,
Japan’s other ’21 demands’ were not met at
Versailles.
<br>
<br>
Japanese officials felt that they did not receive
equal treatment in the Naval Disarmament
Conferences of 1922 and 1927, or in the Council
of the League of Nations. Japan’s assertiveness
was externally expressed in expanding its
commercial and industrial reach into Western
markets, the Manchurian province of northern
China, through Southeast Asia, and to the
western Pacific basin where it rivaled the US.
Internally, Japan’s civilian and parliamentary
government came under increasing strain,
especially as economic depression deepened, and
soon passed under the control of a militaristic
clique of army and naval officers. Japan
announced its withdrawal from the League in
1933 and joined an Anti-Comintern Pact with
Germany and Italy in November 1937.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Armed Camps</i></strong></div>

The nature of modern warfare was the result
of two simultaneous processes. First was the idea
of 'nation in arm' or conscription in the French
Revolution. This gave men equality in battle
which was denied to them in actual life. This
democratization of war transformed wars into
mass-wars or people's war in which civilians and
civil-life itself became the proper and sometimes
the main target of military strategy. The other
was the growth of industrial economy which
provided the resources, the organizational
techniques and methods of motivation needed
to fight mass-wars, thus remodeling them as
total wars.
<br>
<br>
The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed the
transformation of war from specialized activity
of a professional military group. First into the
total mobilization of industrial resources to
produce weapons, then into total involvement of
entire industrial societies in the process of hurling
concentrated mechanized forces against military
or civilian targets anywhere on the globe, and
finally into a scientific contest to develop
weapons of mass destruction. The armament race
among major powers continued, fuelled by the
profit motives of the private firms such as Krupp
in Germany, Vickers Armstrong in Britain,
Schneider-Cruesot in France, Skoda in Austria
and Putiloff in Russia, collectively known as 'the
merchants of death'.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Massive Mobilization Of Resources</i></strong></div>

The character of industrial mobilization
changed markedly during the World War II.
Instead of the mass production of a few key items,
as in the First World War, the second global
conflict drew on virtually every phase of industry.
The new engines of war, tanks, aircrafts, radar
etc, were highly complex and delicate. It required
an elaborate system of mass production of several
million items according to schedules and priorities
which went on shifting with new technical
developments and the changing emphasis of war
strategy. This could be planned only by states at
a high level of economic development. When the
war came, all major combatants channeled their
production capacities into the manufacture of
goods for sustenance of war.
<br>
<br>
During the World War II, European war
economies also adopted the American system of
mass-production. Standardized interchangeable
parts were produced in bulk and the end product
was put together on the assembly line.
In five war years, USA economy produced
300,000 military aircraft and 86,700 tanks.
Germany produced 44,857 tanks and assault guns
in the same period and also produced 111,767
aircraft during 1934-44. It became necessary to
conscript the entire economy and civilian life to
achieve these military targets.
A high level of armed mobilization, which
hovered around 20% for most powers during
the Second World War, and which lasted for a
few years, produced a kind of social revolution
in the employment of women outside the
household, temporarily in the World War I and
permanently in the World War II. Only Germany
avoided this integration of women in the labour
market for ideological reasons, as the Nazi State
did not consider women worthy of employment
outside their houses.
<br>
<br>
Another important aspect of war was that it
was waged as a zero-sum game, i.e., as a war
which could only be totally won or totally lost.
Unlike the earlier wars which were fought for
specific and limited objectives, world wars were
waged for unlimited ends. In the Second World
War, this found expression in the phrase
"unconditional surrender". The USA removed all
restrictions on Allied armament contracts,
including those of immediate payment through
the lend-lease agreements.
The new military establishments took on
many of the features of great industrial
enterprises; Modern business method, office
organization, system of record keeping. The use
of duplicating, sorting and communication
equipment and all such paraphernalia for
carrying on large industrial operations and
emergence of a kind of corporate leadership in
the management of military strategy gave military
institutions many characteristics of a large
business corporation. The army officers became
"the managers of violence".
<br>
<br>
In most of the belligerent countries, there was
suspension of market mechanism in favour of
controls and direction designed to ensure the
restructuring of national economies according to
the needs and priorities of war production. War
was no longer a matter predominantly of purely
financial costs-but assumed the form of
mobilization of all economic resources.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Technological Innovations</i></strong></div>

After World War I, fully automatic weapons
in the rifle weight class or the Assault Rifles were
developed which combined the burst-fire
capability of the sub-machineguns with the range
and accuracy of the infantry rifle. The better
known were German MP-44, and after World
War II, the Soviet Kalashnikov and AK-47.
In World War II, anti-aircraft guns became
more improved and lethal. The role of field and
naval artillery declined-the tank partly relieving
its field role and the tactical bomber aircraft its
bombardment role. Light and mobile guns were
more in demand during World War II. Some
important anti-aircraft guns used during World
War II were-the Bofors 40 mm gun of US and
UK, Soviet M-1939, 37 mm gun and German 88
mm guns. Arrival of Tanks was countered by
the development of armour-piercing ammunition.
In the World War II, heavier machineguns
were used. The lighter variety of machineguns
such as German MG-34/42, the Soviet Degtyarev,
British Bren and US BAR fired 350-600 rounds
per minute. The sub machineguns such as
German MP-38/40 series, popularly known as
'burp' guns, Soviet PPD and PPsh, American
Thompson and the British Sten were also used
extensively.
<br>
<br>
Submarines were used on a larger scale in
the World War II in the Atlantic by Germany
and in the Pacific by the US. US navy's Agronaut
during Inter-war period and Gato and Balao
submarines during World War II played decisive
role in the naval warfare.
German Zeppelins were early military aircraft
used during World War I. Their use did not prove
very effective. Later, military aircrafts were
improved. The bombers were also improved, with
Boeing Aircraft Company producing B-9 bombers
in 1931-the progenitor of all modern combat
aircrafts.
During the Second World War, chemical
weapons were stockpiled but were not integrated
into military planning. Military ineffectiveness
and fear of retaliation prevented their use. During
the World War II, Germany developed V1 and
V2 missiles (1944-45) nicknamed in German as
'Vergeltungswaffen' (or Vengeance weapons)
which became the precursors of modern ballistic
missiles.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nuclear Weapons</i></strong></div>

US entered the World War II in December
1941 and started the Manhattan Project to make
atom bomb. Colonel Leslie Groves became the
head of the Manhattan Engineer District. In
October 1942, after reorganization, J. Robert
Oppenheimer became the director of Project Y
(group that actually designed the bomb). A
plutonium weapon-Trinity was tested in July 1945
in South Central New Mexico. On 6 August 1945
at 8.15 am, local time, a US B-29 bomber named
Enola Gay flew over Hiroshima. The untested U235 bomb nicknamed Little Boy was air-burst
1900 feet above the city to maximize destruction.
The effects were devastating-about two-thirds
of city was completely destroyed and 140,000
persons died by the end of the year (out of a
population of 350,000). A second weapon, a
duplicate of plutonium-239 implosion assembly
which was tested as Trinity, and nicknamed
Fatman was planned to be dropped at Kokura
on 11 August 1945, but schedule was moved up
two days to avoid bad weather, to 9 August, the
US bomber, unable to sight Kokura, dropped it
on the secondary target of Nagasaki.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Results of War</i></strong></div>

World War 2 involved mass destruction of
physical resources, productive capacities and
human resources of both the victors and
vanquished. The estimated deaths in the World
War II were between 3-5 times the estimated
figures for the World War I. It included about
5.1 million Jews. About 20% of total population
of the USSR, Poland and Yugoslavia was wiped
out in the second war.
The loss of productive capacities was also
enormous. About 20% pre-war capital assets of
USSR 13% pre-war assets in Germany, 8% in
Italy, 7% in France and 3% in Britain were
destroyed during the World War II. The night of
9 November 1938, the night of broke glass
(Kristallnacht in German) inaugurated the
Holocaust (or the mass murder of about 5.1
million European Jews by the Nazis). On the
night of 9 November 1938, a number of Jews
were killed and about 20-30,000 were sent to
concentration camps.
<br>
<br>
In the World War II, the number of stateless,
the uprooted people in Europe were 40.5 million,
excluding non-German forced labourers in
Germany and Germans who fled before the
advancing Soviet armies. About 13 million
Germans were expelled from the parts of
Germany annexed by Poland and the USSR, from
Czechoslovakia and parts of South-Eastern
Europe. Other major byproduct of war, partition
of India and the Korean War produced 15 million
and 5 million displaced persons. The Establishment of Israel-another war-effect, uprooted about
1.3 million Palestinians.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>World: Post World War 2</i></strong></div>

In the decisive phase of the war the forces of
liberal democracy and socialism got together to
defeat and eliminate the third force, fascism. But
sooner, the world was split between a
Communist bloc, an anti-Communist bloc, and a
small number of neutral states. In February 1945,
Churchill (British Prime Minister), Roosevelt
(American President) and Stalin, leader of Soviet
Union met at Yalta in the Crimea. It was easy
for the Allies to agree in their objective of
defeating Germany and Japan. But differences
of interests, opinion and ideas surfaced when
the question of future opened up.
Britain and America disliked communism and
feared its spread in the devastated countries of
Europe. The display of Russian strength during
the war also alarmed them. The allies had agreed
to free elections in the East European Countries
liberated by the Red Army such as Poland,
Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria,
Yugoslavia, and Albania. But Stalin imposed
communist governments of these countries.
Eastern Poland was exchanged with German
Silesia by Stalin, thus moving the Russian frontier
further west. Britain intervened in Greece and
toppled a Communist government there.
Germany was initially divided into four
zones. Berlin, the capital city under Russiancontrolled zone was also similarly divided. In
1948, three western zones introduced a new
currency, without consulting the eastern zone,
resulting in rail and road traffic blockade by
Soviet Union for eight month during which the
British and Americans air-lifted all supplies to
Berlin. The Soviet on the one side and US, Britain
and France on other side, opposed each other in
every sphere. The Eastern European countries
under Soviet hegemony refused to accept
American aid under the Marshall Plan, for
reconstruction of their economies. The Soviet
Union made the atomic bomb in 1949 and the
situation of hostility further intensified which
was called the Cold War. Peace remained elusive
in this open ideological war.
<br>
<br>
Certain non-European forces were of great
significance within European from World War
2-end to until the end of the 1980s. These were,
for example, the preponderance of American
influence in European affairs, the dominance of
the dollar in the global financial system, and the
sustained hostility between the two militarized
politico-economic blocs that emerged after the
war. The West European powers, especially the
United Kingdom, had been financially depleted
by the war and been displaced from their great
power eminence; they now opted, with varying
degrees of reluctance or enthusiasm, for a subordinate relationship with capital-surplus USA.
In Yugoslavia, the situation was complicated
by the presence of two distinct pressure groups,
the communist National Liberation Front led by
Josip Broz Tito on the one hand, and on the
other, the nationalist and royalist Chetniks under
Draza Mihailovich. Yugoslavia was exceptional
for the communists having seized power without
the assistance of the Red Army; it was therefore
able to join the Soviet Bloc and leave it
subsequently of its own volition.
Poland had been bifurcated during the war
and occupied by both Germany and the Soviet
Union: The nationalist Home Army worked in
co-operation with the exiled government in
London. But it was decimated by the Germans
after the failure of the Warsaw Uprising in 1944.
In Soviet occupied Poland, the communist-led
Polish Committee of National Liberation managed
to seize the initiative with the help of the
advancing Soviet Red army. Given the
destruction of the home Army, it was able to
dominate the Provisional Government of National
Unity that was formed by the merger of the two
rival provisional governments based in London
and Soviet-held Poland.
<br>
<br>
However, not all of Europe followed this
pattern. Unlike so many other cases, the resistance
movements in Denmark, the Netherlands, and
Norway were relatively unified. They posed little
difficulty for post-War national political revival.
Of the major European countries outside the Soviet
bloc, Spain, Portugal, and Greece witnessed
prolonged dictatorships: it was not until the
1970s that electoral democracy was restored.
Stable multi-party coalition arrangements
emerged the most significant and perhaps the
most peculiar of such supra-national projects was
the making of the two Germanies. "Race for
Berlin" led to the partition of Germany into four
zones, one under each occupying power. The
initial Franco-US agenda, overriding British
objections, proposed to de-industrialize Germany.
But later, US shifted perspective from the
relatively isolationist "America First" stance to
the pursuit of an unambiguously interventionist
one described as the "leadership of the Free World."
From this now flowed the Truman Doctrine
and the Marshall Plan. The Truman Doctrine
announced its support for "free people who are
resisting attempted subjugation by armed
minorities or by outside pressure"; and the
Marshall Plan, known officially as the European
Recovery Programme, set out to revive and
reconstruct Europe, including West Germany, The
Marshall plan was set within the framework of
the new monetary and trading system based on
the supremacy of the US dollar and the
dismantling of trade barriers. The latter were
envisaged by the Bretton Woods institutions
(World Bank and International Monetary Fund
or IMF) and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade (GATT).
<br>
<br>
The French, British, and American zones were
merged in 1949 to create the Federal Republic of
Germany (West Germany). However, sovereignty
was granted to the Federal Republic only in 1955
after its defences were secured by a limited
remilitarization and its induction into NATO. The
zone of Soviet occupation, or East Germany, went
through the same process of being restructured
to ensure integration with the Soviet power
structure. The new state was established in 1949;
Berlin, the capital of undivided Germany, having
been likewise divided, continued to remain the
focus of hostilities, from the Blockade of 1948 to
the building of the wall in 1961.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economic Recovery Continues</i></strong></div>

The Council of Mutual Economic Assistance
(COMECON) was established in 1949 as a transcontinental military body, and the European Coal
and Steel Community appeared in 1951 with
the specific economic concerns. The European
Economic Community of 1957 and the European
Community of 1957 had larger objectives that
prompted apprehensions of loss of national
sovereignty, notably in Britain. In response,
Britain initiated in 1959 the European Free Trade
Association (EFTA).
<br>
<br>
The first phase of economic recovery, from
1945 to 1947, was effected though bilaterally
negotiated US loans and grants and the food aid
disbursed through the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Agency (UNRRA). These sufficed
to avert the general collapse of the economy that
industrial dislocation and poor harvest
threatened; they were adequate even to raise
industrial output to pre-war levels.
During the next phase of recovery, 1948-1951,
European countries willing to participate in the
US-sponsored recovery program received 13
billion dollars. This was supplemented by a 1
billion dollar loan from the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (World
Bank). The largest beneficiaries of this program
were Britain, France, Italy, and West Germany.
It established an international body of
recipient nations, the organization for European
Economic Co-operation, to which each nation
submitted a national plan every four years. These
aid-receiving nations were required, under the
"counterpart" clause, to make available a fund
of domestic currency equal to the aid received
and to be spent in ways approved by the US.
They had to agree to use the aid to finance food
imports only from the US whether or not
cheaper alternative sources were available. They
had to also employ the service of US shipping
and insurance for 50% of aid financed purchases,
besides also ensuring preferential treatment to
American oil interests.
<br>
<br>
It led on to a long economic boom that lasted
until the mid-1970s. Although the deflationary
policies created some employment, they also led
to the economic boom. As a result the period
after the 1970s witnessed a near full employment.
It yielded a "new capitalism" of near full
employment, high productivity, high wages, and
extensive social welfare. All these combined to
blunt class antagonism and to generate
consensual politics.
However, the results were uneven across
West Europe. Less developed countries like
Ireland, Spain, and Portugal were less affected
by the quantitative and qualitative transformations achieved by the more advanced
economies. However, the long boom came to an
end in 1973 with the first oil shock, when oilproducing countries unilaterally and dramatically
raised the prices of oil. European economies
suffered inflationary pressures, output decelerated,
and unemployment rose. They immediately led
to restrictive policies within the parameters of
the existing system of economic management,
and more gradually, to a change of economic
perspective.
<br>
<br>
From the late 1970s, in country after country,
the social democratic consensus broke down.
New political program proposed to restrict social
welfare to the minimum necessary. They
repudiated government intervention and demand
management. All these led to the privatization
of nationalized industries, extensive deregulation,
and the adoption of monetarist and supply side
policies.
The idea of the "social democratic consensus"
itself is valid only in post-war terms. It was based
on a substantial and pragmatic dilution of the
pre-war program of social democracy to
accommodate fundamental tenets of conservatism
(the sanctity of private property) and of liberalism
(the limited state). Social Democracy thus
conceded the possibility of the gradualist reform
of capitalism.
This consensus allowed stable coalitions of
right-centre and left-centre groupings:
occasionally, in the immediate aftermath of bitter
electoral conflict, even "grand coalitions" of the
left and the right were possible. Except for Britain
in West Europe, the predominant tendency was
towards the formation of coalition governments
even where the electoral system was not based
on proportional representation.
Economic Recovery in Soviet Block
In the Soviet bloc, reconstruction was
hindered by the relatively lower capacity of the
leading power, the Soviet Union. External capital
was in short supply, except on terms that were
unacceptable to the Soviet system. Capital for
the industrialization program therefore had to
be internally generated. In the newly Soviet
countries, nationalization permitted rapid
expansion in heavy industrial capacity. Radical
agrarian programs of farm collectivization and
nationalization on the Soviet model soon plunged
the agricultural sector into turmoil and led to
food shortages.
<br>
<br>
East Europe was thus preoccupied with the
problem of adjusting to a new system of
production and stagnation in the very sectors
whose boom was the basis of West European
prosperity. The plan-driven economies of the
eastern bloc, with the exception of the USSR, began
with a very low industrial base. Since investment
priorities were largely determined by the state,
national plans focused excessively on developing
heavy industry. The resulting imbalance led to
chronic shortages of consumer goods.
In the initial stages, trade and economic
relations were confined to the region, that is, the
eastern bloc. However, the shortage of capital
and of agricultural products, especially wheat,
led to a parallel dependence on western countries.
Poland and Romania borrowed extensively from
the West in the 1970s to finance their
industrialization programs; By the early 1970s,
the USSR was compelled to import grain from
the USA.
<br>
<br>
Imports of food grain and light industrial
from the hard currency areas (West), without
corresponding exports resulted in a combined
balance of payments deficit of 10 billion dollars
by 1975. These were financed by borrowings from
western banks. Imports were cut back and the
deficit was eliminated; but, by 1982, East bloc
debts stood at 81 billion dollars and its debt
service ratio stood at 100 percent, that is it was
borrowing money solely in order to pay back
debts. Soviet export earnings deteriorated with
the collapse of world oil prices in the mid 1980s.
