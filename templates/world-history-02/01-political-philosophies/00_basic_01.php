<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CAPITALISM</i></strong></div>

Industrial capitalism implies the investment
of capital in manufacturing industry, with a
subordination of labour to such investment and
a focus on the maximum extraction of profits as
returns on investment. It may be distinguished
from trading capitalism or finance capitalism
which has commercial and financial transactions
respectively as their focus.
Dictionary of Social Sciences explained
capitalism as denoting an economic system in
which the greater proportion of economic life,
particularly ownership of and investment in
production goods, is carried on under private
(i.e. non-governmental) auspices through the
process of economic competition with an avowed
incentive of profit.
<br>
<br>
Wealth amassed by capitalism differs in
quality as well as quantity from that
accumulated in pre-capitalist societies. Wealth
under capitalism is typically accumulated as
commodities or objects produced for sale rather
than for direct use by its owners.
Rise of capitalism is associated with three
main features: (1) the growth of the capitalist
spirit i.e. the desire for profits, (2) the
accumulation of capital, and (3) the development
of capitalist techniques.
<br>
<br>
<b>Capitalism:</b> Birth to Bloom
In the middle ages, the form assumed by
commercial capitalism was entirely different. In
England, and in Holland, the birth of capitalism
can be dated from the late 16th and early 17th
centuries. The capital amassed was available to
fund the famous chartered companies (Dutch
East India Company 1602; West India Company
1621). It also provided the circulating capital for
merchants engaged in the ‘putting-out system’
whereby they supplied raw materials to domestic
handicrafts workers and marketed the product.
This stage of capitalism based upon riches
amassed from commerce is known as commercial
capitalism. Early capitalism is the combination
of commercial and financial activities, of trade
and banking. Under the ‘putting-out’ system, or
Verlagssystem, (as it was called in Holland), a
wealthy merchant (capitalist) buys the raw
material, pays a variety of labourers to work it
up into a finished product at home or in shops,
and sells the finished product.
<br>
<br>
The whole industry became merchantdominated and craftsmen became mere wage
earners. It was also known as the domestic
system as the work was done in the homes of
individual workers instead of in the shop of
master craftsman. Capitalism did exist in ancient
world in the form of commerce as well as guild
system and merchant dominated putting-out
system in the medieval world.
One can also distinguish the periods of early
capitalism, full capitalism (Hochkapitalismus)
and late capitalism. In the period of early
capitalism, which lasted from the 13th century
to the middle of the 18th century, economic
agents, i.e. the entrepreneurs and the workers
operated within the old feudal framework and
retained all the features of their handicraft
origin and pre-capitalist mentality. The output
of factories and manufactories was still not very
significant. In the period of full capitalism,
which closed with the outbreak of the World
War, the scope of economic activity was
expanded enormously, and scientific and
technological application was also remarkably
broadened. The period of late capitalism can be
best characterized by describing the changes
which capitalism has been undergoing since the
World War I.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Evolution and Types Of Capitalism</i></strong></div>

Marxist historians have identified a series
of stages in the evolution of capitalism; merchant
or commercial capitalism, agrarian capitalism,
industrial capitalism and state capitalism. The
first stage, i.e. mercantile or commercial
capitalism provided the initial thrust and impetus
for capitalism in the sense that merchants started
becoming entrepreneurs to cater to market
demands by employing wages labourers as well
as by exploiting the existing craft guilds.
Commercial Capitalism metamorphosed into
industrial capitalism, which again, according to
Marxist economists, gave way to socialism.
<br>
<br>
Commercial Capitalism and agrarian
capitalism were, therefore, two forms of
capitalism that overlapped with each other, the
difference between them being that one emerged
out of commercial surplus while the other out
of agricultural surplus. Agrarian capitalism
sometimes metamorphosed fully into commercial
capitalism i.e. invested the entire surplus
accumulated from agriculture into commerce
and sometimes transformed directly into
industrial capitalism by investing in industrial
development alone.
<br>
<br>
Sometimes capital was accumulated from
both these sources, i.e. commerce’s and
agriculture, and paved the path for the rise of
industrial capitalism. Agrarian capitalism was
emphasized by Immanuel Wallerstein who
adopted a world-economy perspective, and
considered its origin to be rooted in the agrarian
capitalism.
According to Wallerstein, in world
economy, there existed certain zones—like the
periphery, the semi-periphery and the core. The
strong states imposed unequal exchange upon
the weak states. Therefore, the strong states or
the core dominated the entire world economy
in agrarian capitalism which was the essence of
a national economy where production is
separated from consumption, and is made a
source of profit after being utilized in profitmaking enterprises. Agricultural revolution,
therefore, played a very significant role in the
growth of capitalism by feeding a growing
population and by creating a surplus to meet
the demand for industrial raw materials.
A fourth form of Capitalism is —state
capitalism—defined by Lenin as a system under
which state takes over and exploits means of
production in the interest of the class which
controls the state; but the phrase, ‘state
capitalism’, is also used to describe any system
of state collectivization, without reference to its
use for the benefit of any particular class. There
is a fifth form in which there is an increased
element of state intervention either in terms of
welfare programmes of lessening the impact of
business cycle. This is welfare capitalism or
protected capitalism. Precisely, capital
accumulation out of the profits of merchants to
be invested in various economic activities was
what is called commercial capitalism. It tools
different forms in different stages. For example,
it existed in some of its elements in ancient
Egypt and in ancient Rome. The ancient times
were the age of capitalist accumulation, rather
than capitalist production.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>History of Capitalism</i></strong></div>

From 1100 on, real accumulation of wealth
were made, frequently in the first instance in the
form of coin, which might later be invested in
land, building, or ships, in some instances these
accumulations sprang from agricultural surplus.
Under Commercial Capitalism capital
accumulation took place out of the profits of
merchants, quite independent of the employment
of workers for wages. This was the point which
distinguished commercial capitalism from other
forms of capitalism. The ancient period,
therefore, was the age more of commercial
accumulation rather than of commercial
capitalism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Commercial Capitalism: Features, Evolution
and Results</i></strong></div>

According to Sombart, Commercial
Capitalism or ‘early capitalism’ operated within
the feudal framework. Main feudal features of
this phase were as follows. Work was generally
done in the homes of the producers and not
under the factory shades of modern industries.
Not full-scale machines, but simple tools were
used for manufacturing. And many a times
these factors of production were owned by the
workers themselves. Since factors of production
were limited, manufacturing was also on a
much smaller scale as compared to goods
produced in factories. One man, i.e., the
merchant entrepreneur, controlled the whole
process from start to finish. At the same time
certain capitalist features were also visible. e.g.
Incentive of profit was the main driving force
behind the entire process. With increasing desire
for profits, the demand for labour was rising
tremendously with the result that the merchant
capitalists were hiring more and more workers.
Financial advances were provided to the
producers by the capitalists. These could be
equated to wages under industrial capitalism.
The final product as well as the entire profit was
appropriated by the capitalists.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Evolution of Commercial Capitalism</i></strong></div>

Three major themes can be identified in
evolution of Commercial Capitalism. The first is
the transfer of organization and control of
production from the imperial and aristocratic
strata of pre-capitalist states into the hands of
mercantile elements. Second theme deals with
how Feudal social relationships were replaced
by market relationships based upon exchange
and this in turn steadily improved the wealth
and social importance of the merchants against
the aristocracy. Economic organization of
production and distribution through purchase
and sale dominated the entire scene. It resulted
in the separation of a traditionally seamless web
of rulership into two realms. One of them
involved the exercise of the traditional political
tasks of rulership, and the other realm was
limited to the production and distribution of
goods and services. Third theme is related to the
presence of an ideological framework based
upon profit which contrasts sharply with that
of pre-capitalist formations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Changes: Guilds – Putting Out - Commercial
Capitalism</i></strong></div>

With the decomposition of the feudal order
formation of mercantile capitalism or commercial
capitalism took root. The system of manufacture
at this time was widely through guilds, that is,
economic and social association of merchants or
craftspeople in the same trade of craft to protect
the interests of its members. The guild system
declined from the 16th century because of
changing trade and work conditions which led
to the emergence of the putting-out system
which developed in the woollen industry.
Although the scale of production was
insignificant, the organization was basically
capitalist.
<br>
<br>
One can date the capitalist era as beginning
in the 16th century. However, historians and
economists have referred to this early stage as
mercantile or commercial capitalism. Significant
progress in the field of trade and commercial
capitalism led to immense accumulation of
capital and is referred to as the Commercial
Revolution.
In the paper and textile industry, one of the
main reasons for European success was the
mechanization of the productive process by the
adoption of the water mill. The most spectacular
consequences of the supremacy acquired by
Europe in the technical field were the geographic
explorations and the subsequent economic,
political and military expansion of Europe.
Discovery in Mexico and Peru led to rich deposits
of gold and especially silver. In 1503 precious
metals also arrived from the Antilles. Precious
metals became more abundant; prices rose
because demand for goods had risen because
the abundance of precious metals had made
people richer and production could not expand
proportionately. As a result, the rise in demand
resulted in a rise in price.
<br>
<br>
The period 1500 to 1620 was the ‘Price
Revolution’. Between 1500 and 1620, the average
level of prices in the various European countries
increased by 300 to 400 per cent. The net result
was that the merchant and banking bourgeoisie
gathered strength. With banking and merchant
bourgeoisies having acquiring immense fortunes
and national states having mastered the means
of conquest and domination, the conditions
were ready in the 16th century for the future
development of capitalism.
Transformation of the European trade
occurred as a result of the overseas expansion
and the influx of bullion. Most significant
changes were: growth in international trade,
ending of regionalism, trans-oceanic trade,
growth of markets, and new kinds of commercial
organizations.
<br>
<br>
Banking was very limited in the Middle
Ages due to moral disapproval and was carried
on mostly by the Jew. Usury was common
among the Jews since the 11th century because
they were the real moneylenders. The prohibitions
against usury issued by the church could mean
nothing to them since they were not Christians.
By the 15th century, however, the banking
business had spread to southern Germany and
France. The first important Bank was the Bank
of Sweden (1657). The most important one the
Bank of England was founded in 1694.
Formation of regulated companies, i.e. an
association of merchants grouped together for
a common venture, was another feature of the
Commercial Revolution. A standard system of
money was adopted by every important state to
be used for all transaction within its borders.
The creation of national currencies was therefore
really an important achievement of the
Commercial Revolution.
<br>
<br>
In the 16th century, the flow of spices from
the East and the bullion from the West were
important. But gradually new overseas products
became staples of consumption in Europe and
grew in commercial importance—indigo from
the East, porcelain from China, cocoa from
America, tea and coffee from the Far East and
the Near East, etc. till the end of the 17th
century, capitalism can be called commercial
capitalism, as it was capital dominated by
commercial activity.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mercantilism</i></strong></div>

Mercantilism, a term coined by Adam
Smith, played an important role in the evolution
of Commercial Capitalism. Maurice Dobb refers
to it as ‘a system of state regulated exploitation
through trade—essential the economic policy in
age of primitive accumulation. Mercantilism
can be said to be a state controlled economic
policy which aimed at regulating the trade and
commerce of the nation, as well as its factories
and manufacturers with the primary purpose of
ultimately to concentrate and wield political
power.
<br>
<br>
It had certain common characteristic
features like bullionism, paternalism, imperialism,
economic nationalism, etc. Bullionism meant
that the prosperity of a nation was determined
by the quantity of precious metals within its
borders, became an essential element of
mercantilism. Mercantilism is closely interlinked
with Commercial Capitalism as growth of the
latter attracted the attention of the state and
although the activities of the merchants were
sometimes obstructed and hampered by the
policy of mercantilism and therefore the
merchants were forced to oppose mercantilist
policies on those occasions. On the whole the
merchants were positively benefited by the state
policies like creating markets by acquiring
colonies and thereby expanding exports by
building fleets, by providing protection against
foreign goods by raising the tariff, by maintaining
banks, by giving subsidies, etc.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Feudalism To Capitalism</i></strong></div>

Two main points of views are available for
explaining the demolition of feudal model of
production. One view believes that the exchange
relations or external trade demolished it. Another
view postulates that inner contradictions like
exploitation of the peasant by the nobility and
unproductive use of economic surplus like
expenditure on war and luxury were responsible
for the break-down of feudalism.
Dobb raised a point regarding the emergence
of capitalism: supersession of serfdom by
contractual relations, relation or rise of peasant
property. This was the result of the inner
contradictions in the feudal relation between
the nobility and the peasantry. The very misery
of the peasantry created the danger of
depopulation of manors. The effects of the
nobility’s expenditure on unproductive activities
like were equally disastrous. Overexploitation of
labour, unproductive use of economic surplus
and exhaustion of power and opportunities to
increase lord’s revenue made the feudal mode
increasingly untenable. Dobb attached producers
released from feudal constraints and engaged in
the petty mode of production. Le Roy Ladurie
stressed the importance of the demographic
model implying that the long-term trends of the
feudal economy conformed to the Malthusian
sequence of population growth outstripping
food supply and then demographic decline due
to calamities like famine; starvation, etc.
Abundance of labour in the 16th century, due
to population growth gave a boost to feudalism.
Conversely, feudalism received a blow in the
17th century with a sharp fall in population.
This was, in the view of Ladurie, the decisive
role of the demographic factor in shaping the
nature and sequence of transition.
<br>
<br>
According to Brenner, the two fundamental
problems regarding the transition related to:
(i) the decline versus persistence of serfdom and
its effects, and (ii) the emergence and
predominance of secure small peasant property
versus the rise to landlord-large tenant farmer
relations on the land. In the 14th and 15
centuries the perpetual class conflict between
the second and third social groups resulted in
the triumph of the peasantry and serfdom came
to an end. In England, however, since the
monarchy was dependent on the gentry for
taxes, it could not protect the peasantry against
the oppression of the gentry and the feudal
lords. As a result, the peasantry was ultimately
again suppressed by feudalism, leading to the
deprivation of land which was subsequently
enclosed by the landlords. The successful
enclosure movement in England laid the
foundation of agrarian capitalism in the 16th
century and this facilitated the process of early
industrialization. In France, however, the
monarchy was directly dependent upon the
peasants for taxes. So the landlords could not
enclose the lands successfully as the peasants
resisted the move. As a result, agrarian capitalism
could not develop in France. It was all the more
delayed in Eastern Europe where monarchy
was extremely weak, feudal were powerful and
consequently feudalism continued in its strongest
form.
<br>
<br>
Anderson stressed the importance of town
and international trade to the process of capitalist
development. His theory is also known as ‘electric
Marxism.’ The putting-out system was much
more elaborately developed and manufactories
were created when merchant capital was
invested in industrial mode of production. The
change of investment from commercial to
industrial production was accentuated by the
shift in the economic centre from the
Mediterranean to the Atlantic. The metamorphosis of commercial capital into industrial
capital was completed basically by two primary
factors—the deployment of commercial capital
increasingly into industries, thereby transforming it into industrial capital and a significant
increase in the number of factories and
manufactories. Commercial Capitalism, as
mentioned earlier, took different form in different
countries.
<br>
<br>
Another effect of commercial capitalism
was a rise in demand for consumer and capital
goods—textiles, wine, weapons, equipment of
various kinds, etc. and also for commercial and
transport services for the transportation of
finished goods as well as raw materials from
one place to another. The slave trade resulted
in transportation of black population to America.
Rise in demand resulted in increased production.
The ‘Price Revolution’ was therefore an inevitable
consequence of Commercial Capitalism.
Commercial Capitalism resulted in the growth
of markets that again had a very important
outcome—the rise of towns. From the nucleus
of small trading centres, they slowly and
gradually evolved into flourishing, prosperous
towns will all characteristics of urban civilization.
The Price Revolution, on the other hand, led to
the rise of the bourgeoisie class. Nobles, who
could not cope, became heavily in debt.
Merchants, Businessmen, traders, Lawyers, i.e.
the bourgeoisie, made fortunes and thereby
emerged as a powerful force in society.
It was in the phase of industrial
capitalization that capitalism is said to have
achieved its classical form. Capitalism grew
over a long period of time. Consequently,
historians differ as to the point in time where
the phenomenon may be reasonably said to
exist. A capitalist system implies, in the first
place, that property is predominantly in private
hands and the allocation of goods, services, and
factors of production (land, labour and capital)
is made mainly through market mechanisms
with capitalist responding to profit signals,
workers to wage incentives, and consumers to
prices. Most striking characteristic of capitalist
performance has been a sustained (although not
continuous) upward thrust in productivity and
real income per head, which was achieved by
a combination of innovation and accumulation.
The development of capitalism entailed a
revolution in economic relations, institutions,
and attitudes; on occasions it involved violence
on the part of proponents and opponents alike;
and it gave birth to new social classes. The
expanding market economies of medieval
Europe, with various institutional accompaniments (such as the development) of cities,
merchant houses, and guilds) were the
foundation on which later capitalism developed.
Somewhere in the late Middle Age the economic
centre of Europe shifted from the Mediterranean
littoral of Northern Europe. Modern capitalism
first became stabilized between the sixteenth
and eighteenth centuries. But a decisive leap
came forward in the nineteenth century, first in
England, with the merging of a capitalist
economy with the immense technological power
released by the industrial Revolution.
Capitalism is a term denoting a mode of
production in which capital in its various forms
is the principal means of production. The term
‘capital’ (capital, from the Latin word caput of
‘head) first emerged in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, denoting stocks of merchandise, sums
of money, and money carrying interest. In
everyday speech now, the word ‘capital’ is
generally used to describe an asset owned by an
individual as wealth. Capital might then denote
a sum of money to be invested in order to secure
a rate of return, or it might denote the investment
itself: Capital is an asset which generates an
income flow for its owner. The Marxist concept
of capital first, capital is something which in its
generality is quite specific to capitalism. While
capital predates capitalism, in capitalist society
the production of capital predominates, and
dominates every other sort of production. Capital
cannot be understood apart from capitalist
relation of production. Indeed, capital is not a
thing at all, but a social relation which appears
in the form of a thing. Although capital is
undoubtedly about making money, the assets
which ‘make’ money embody a particular
relation between those who have money and
those who do not, such that not only is money
‘made’ but also the private property relations
which engender such a process are themselves
continually reproduced.
<br>
<br>
It is the private ownership of capital in the
hands of a class—the class of capitalists to the
exclusion of the mass of the population—which
is a central feature of capitalism as a mode of
production. Only Marxists have consistently
sought to integrate in a single theoretical
construction the economic, social, political and
cultural dimension of the capitalist phenomenon.
Neither Max Weber nor Joseph Schumpeter, nor
Friedrich von Hayek, all of whom attempted to
construct on-Marxist frameworks to understand
capitalism, succeeded in supplying a satisfactory
framework. Weber’s intellectual enterprise was
essentially one of comparative history, designed
to uncover the roots of the unique Western
development of what he called ‘modern
rationally’, which was intrinsic to the capitalist
system. Schumpeter remained essentially an
economist and his most durable contributions
have remained in economics, for example, his
theory of the economic role of entrepreneurship.
Hayek made some highly astute observations
about the relation of capitalism to various other
phenomena in modern society, such as
democracy and the rule of law, but he never set
out to construct a comprehensive theory
embracing all these relationships. The term
‘capitalism’ is more recent than ‘capitalist. Adam
Smith, commonly regarded as the classical
theorist, did not use the term at all. Capitalism
can be said to be characterized by, production
for sale rather than own use by numerous
producers. A market where labour power too is
a commodity and is bought and sold, the mode
of exchange being money wages for a period of
time (time rate) or for a specified task (piece
rate). The existence of a market for labour
contracts with its absence in either slavery or
serfdom. The predominance is not universal
mediation of exchange by the use of money.
This aspect accentuates the importance of banks
and other financial intermediary institution.
Capitalism or the managerial agent controls the
production (labour) process, choice of techniques,
the output mix, the work environment, and the
arrangement for selling the output control by
the capitalist or the manager of financial
decisions. It is the power of the capitalist
entrepreneur to incur debts or float shares or
mortgage capital assets to raise finance.
There is a competition between capitals.
<br>
<br>
This increasing competition forces the capitalist
to adopt new techniques and practices which
will cut costs, and accumulate to make possible
the purchase of improved machinery. This
competition strengthens the tendency towards
concentration of capital in large firms. It is to
neutralize competition that monopolies and
cartels emerge. A major driving force of capitalist
industrialization is the strong propensity to risk
capital on new techniques that hold promise of
improved profits, in strong contract to the
defensive wariness of the pre-capitalist approach
to technology. Some scholars regard the
application of science to industry as the
distinguishing characteristic of modern industry.
Nor were such efforts limited to men of scientific
training. Indeed one of the most remarkable
features of technical advance in the eighteenth
and early nineteenth centuries was the large
proportion of major inventions made by
ingenious tinkerers, self-taught mechanics and
engineers. The most significant improvements
in technology involve the use of machinery and
mechanical power to transform tasks that had
been done far more slowly and laboriously by
human or animal power. During the eighteenth
century, a notable increase in the use of
waterpower occurred in industries such as grain
milling, textiles, and metallurgy. It involved the
substitution of coal for wood and charcoal as
fuel, and the introduction of the steam engine
for use in mining, manufacturing and
transportation. The use of coal and coke in the
smelting process greatly reduced the cost of
metals and multiplied their uses, whereas the
application of chemical science created a host of
new, ‘artificial’ or synthetic materials.
Though the term ‘industrialization’ is absent
from the work of Marx and Engels, the concept
is clearly present. Marx distinguishes ‘Modern
Industry’ or ‘The Factory System’ or “The
Machinery System’ from earlier forms of
capitalist production, co-operation and
‘Manufacture’. Modern industry is distinguished
from manufacture by the central role of
machinery. Marx distinguishes two stages in the
development of the machinery system. In the
first stage, ‘simple co-operation, ‘ there is only
a ‘conglomeration in the factory of similar and
simultaneously acting machines’ using a single
power source’. In the second stage, a ‘complex
system of machinery’, the product goes through
connected series of detailed processes carried
out by an interlinked chain of machines. David
Landes placed technology at the centre of the
Industry Revolution. Industrialization has come
to be used as a synonym for sustained economic
growth. Expansion of total output alone,
however, is not a sufficient criterion of
industrialization since if population is rising
more rapidly than output, it is compatible with
declining real incomes per head. A country
which retains a large, even predominant,
agricultural sector may be described as
industrialized if real incomes rise and technology
changes. The expression revolution industrielle
was first used in the 1820s by French writers
who, wishing to emphasize the importance of
the mechanization of the French cotton industry
then taking place in Normandy and the Nord,
compared it with the great political revolution
of 1789. It acquired general currency only after
the publication in 1884 of Arnold Toynbee’s
Lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England:
Popular Addresses, Notes and Other Fragments.
Toynbee dated the British Industries Revolution
from 1760. Professor J.U. Nef stressed the
essential continuity of history and traced its
beginning to 1540-1660, with the new capitalistic
industries of Elizabethan England.
<br>
<br>
In the model put forward by Adam Smith
(1723-90) in An Enquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Book 1, the
development of a society’s wealth-equated with
the development of the productivity of labour—
is a function of the degree of the division of
labour. Specialization of productive tasks—
classically achieved through the separation of
agriculture and manufacturing, and their
assignment to country and town respectively.
The division of labour in industrial production
made possible an unprecedented growth in
output and productivity. Smith’s famous
principles that the division of labour is limited
by the extent of the market—literally, the size
of the area and population linked up via trade
relation. For Adam Smith the development of
trade and the division of labour unfailingly
brought about economic development. The
growth of commerce and the growth of liberty
mutually determine each other. Smith and his
fellow ‘political economists’ traced the advance
of capitalism to the onset of conditions that
liberated purportedly inherent human qualities
and to the beneficent operation, in market
transactions, of an ‘invisible hand’ that brought
the common good out of the conflicting selfinterest of all individuals. Commerce could be
seen as a key to prosperity, but only its
unhindered pursuit would secure the maximum
prosperity.
<br>
<br>
To Marx, capitalism was powerful and
dynamic, a superior form of production that
promoted economic growth far above anything
possible in feudalism. He attributed its
appearance not to the release of natural,
unchanging human predisposition but to specific
economic, political, and legal measures. In Marx’s
interpretation of the emergence of capitalism
two broad perspectives are offered. He first
emphasizes the corrosive effect upon the feudal
system of mercantile activity, the growth of a
world market and new expanding cities. The
second variant, evident especially in Capital,
centres on the ‘producer’ and the process
whereby the producer (agricultural or in the
crafts sector) becomes merchant and capitalist.
Marx regards the latter as ‘the really
revolutionary path’ to capitalism since this
transforms the organization and techniques of
production. The primitive (or original)
accumulation of capital is a concept developed
in Marx’s Capital and Grundisse to designate
the process which generates the preconditions
of the ongoing accumulation of capital. In
Marx’s word, ‘primitive accumulation is nothing
else that the historical process of divorcing the
producer from the means of production’. A
property-less class of wage-labourers, the
proletariat, becomes confronted by a class of
capitalists who monopolize the means of
production.
<br>
<br>
Many of Marx’s contemporaries saw capital
as the result of abstinence and saving, as the
original source for accumulation. Marx’s point
is that primitive accumulation is not an
accumulation in this sense at all. Abstinence can
only lead to accumulation if capitalist relations
of production, or the polarization between a
class of capitalists and a class of wage-laboures,
are already in existence. Marx argued that since
pre-capitalist relations of production are
predominantly agricultural, the peasantry
having possession of the principal means of
production, land, capitalism can only be created
by dispossessing the peasantry of the land.
Accordingly, the origins of capitalism are to be
found in the transformation of relations of
production on the land. For Marx the first and
foremost effect of the ‘agricultural revolution’ in
England was to expropriate the peasant from
the soil and establish capitalist agriculture.
Enclosures converted property characterized by
shared rights into private property.
For Marx, merchants could foster primitive
accumulation by usury, crushing artisan guilds,
expanding markets, providing employment or
by investing profits. While Marx emphasized
domestic cause of proletarianization, he focuses
primarily on international commerce in
accounting for the genesis of the industrial
capitalist. This interpretation stresses the
forcefulness, often genocidal, and the unevenness
of primitive accumulation. The theory of ‘protoindustrialization’ (henceforth PI) actually started
with Franklin Mendel’s,’ 1969 dissertation at
the University of Wisconsin, ‘Industrialization
and Population Pressure in Eighteenth-Century
Flanders.’ This was study of the relatively rapid
population growth experienced in the internal
region of Flanders, where a peasant population
combined agriculture with part-time linen
manufacture.
<br>
<br>
PI had distinctive pattern of development.
It generally originated in pastoral regions and
declining or large-scale agricultural areas.
Scholarship on PI emphasizes interconnections
among widening markets, rising populations
(especially rural) seeking wage-earning
employment, and the search for cheap labour
by entrepreneurs. PI is credited with creating
the key changes in the generation of supplementary handicraft incomes which will lead to
an expansion of population. Accordingly,
handicrafts generated the labour supply of the
Industrial Revolution. PI will soon begin to
encounter diminishing returns as dispersed
industry creates difficulties in the collection of
output and the control of quality. PI created
pressures leading to the factory system and to
new technology. PI also is supposed to have led
to the accumulation of capital. PI will lead to
accumulation of technical knowledge by
merchants as a result of their experience with
inter-regional and international trade. PI also
leads to agricultural surplus and reduces the
price of food.
<br>
<br>
Capitalism was from the beginning,
Wallenstein argues, a matter of the worldeconomy and not of nation sates. One with a
common political system and one without. These
he called, respectively, world-empires and worldeconomies. North more elements, Wallerstein
placed Eastern Europe (but not Russia) and
Spanish America at the ‘periphery’, while the
Mediterranean littoral (Spain and the Northern
Italian city-states) became a ‘semi-periphery’.
The core areas had mass market industries,
international and local commerce in the hands
of an indigenous bourgeoisie, and, relatively
advanced and complex forms of agriculture.
The peripheral areas were mono-culture, with
the cash crops produced on large estates by
coerced labour. The semi-peripheral areas were
in the process of de-industrializing. In the core
states relatively strong state systems emerged.
By contrast, the critical feature of the periphery
was the absence of a strong state. The semiperiphery was, once again, in between in its
polity.
<br>
<br>
Wallerstein's identified three stages in the
development of the world-economy. The first
was one of agricultural capitalism, from the
sixteenth to the eighteenth century. In this stage
England first ousted the Netherlands from her
commercial primacy and then successfully
resisted France’s attempt to catch up. It was
only in the third stage from the mid-eighteenth
century, that capitalism became primarily
industrial (rather than agricultural or mercantile).
“Industrial revolution’ was not merely economic,
but social, intellectual and political too.
Agriculture’s contribution in this respect has
been broadly assessed on four counts, namely
whether it created a food surplus for the nonrural population; whether it helped to widen
home and foreign markets; whether it generated
capital for industrial investment; and whether
it supplied a labour force for industrial
employment.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect on society</i></strong></div>

The pre-capitalist social system that of the
ancient regime was one of ‘estates.’ An estate
was a stratum in which all the three major
benefits—privilege, power, and prestige—were
largely determined at birth and, also were fixed
as legal inequalities. The modern bourgeoisie
grew out of the Third Estate first demands of
this new class was legal equality of all-or at least
of those above a certain minimal level of wealth.
Max Weber placed the contrast between estates
and classes at the core of his theory of social
stratification and Marx made this a key criterion
in his analysis of what constituted a class. When
Marx used the concept of class in political
analysis, he held that a class must have a certain
degree of cohesion and sense of common purpose,
as well as common relationship to the means of
production. Feudal estates were too internally
stratified to possess this attribute. One very
significant change with capitalist industrialization has been the enormous expansion of the
middle strata. 
<br>
<br>
The basic cause of this development
was undoubtedly technological. An ever-smaller
portion of the labour force was required for the
actual tasks of material production, allowing
the diversion of ever larger numbers of workers
into administrative activities. There was also a
vast expansion of the state bureaucracies.
Effective control over economic resources
rather than legal ownership of them is the
defining criterion for the top capitalist class.
Thus Nicos Poulantzas, in Classes in
Contemporary Capitalism begins by defining
the bourgeoisie not in terms of a legal category
of property ownership but in terms of ‘economic
ownership’ (that is, real economic control of the
means of production and of the products) and
‘possession’ (that is, the capacity to put the
means of production into operation. In The
Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism,
Marx Weber makes it clear that a capitalist
enterprise and the pursuit of gain are not at all
the same thing, it called for a new type of
economic agent, the capitalist entrepreneur.
One of Weber’s insights that has remained
widely accepted is that the capitalist entrepreneur
is a very distinctive type of human being. Weber
was fascinated by that, he thought to begin with
what was a puzzling paradox. In many cases,
men—and a few women—evinced a drive
towards the accumulation of wealth but at the
same time showed a ‘ferocious asceticism,’ a
singular absence of interest in the worldly
pleasures that such wealth could buy. Many
entrepreneurs actually pursued a lifestyle that
was ‘decidedly frugal’.
<br>
<br>
For Weber, capitalism was originally
sparked by religious fervor. Without that fervor
the organization of labour that made capitalism
so different from what had gone before would
not have been possible. In India, Hinduism was
associated with great wealth in history, but its
tenets about the afterlife prevented the same
sort of energy that built up under Protestantism,
and capitalism properly never developed. For
Max Weber, ‘rational restlessness’ was the
psychological make-up of Europe, the opposite
of what he found in the main religions of Asia:
rational acceptance of social order by
Confucianism and its irrational antithesis in
Taoism; mystical acceptance of social order by
Hinduism; the worldly retreat in Buddhism.
Weber located rational restlessness especially in
Puritanism. Such persons are ‘enterprising’
because they are liberated from strong communal
ties, which enable them to seek new opportunities
without the constraints of collective tradition,
customs and taboos. This clearly involves a
certain ‘ego ideal’, a strong discipline, traits that
Weber called ‘inner-worldly asceticism. Joseph
Schumpeter stressed the central role of the
capitalist entrepreneur, rather than the stock of
capital, as the incarnation of technical progress.
First, capitalist themselves are not the motivating
force of capitalism, but instead entrepreneurs
who invent new techniques or machinery by
means of which goods are produced more
cheaply. In any urban environment, people
would have ideas for innovation, but who had
those ideas, when and where they had them,
and what they did with them were unpredictable. The second element of Schumpeter’s
outlook was, that profit, as generated by
entrepreneurs, was temporary.
<br>
<br>
R.H. Tawney in 1921 argued that capitalism
had created The Aquisitive Society. He thought
that capitalism misjudged human nature,
elevating production and the making of profit,
which ought to be a means to certain ends, into
ends in them. In particular, it sabotages ‘the
instinct for service and solidarity’ that is the
basis for traditional civil society. He thought
that in the long run capitalism was incompatible
with culture. Soviet experiment in application
of the socialist model underwent various phases
in accordance with the demand of the time.
There were contradictions from within and
outside which eventually led to its disintegration.
At the same time, the same model was applied
differently even in the countries under the
Soviet influence, which gradually gave way to
the dominant capitalist system. Yet, it would be
immature to argue that this model was a
complete failure as it was this model which
forced the so called capitalist economies of the
Western Europe to integrate welfare economic
principles and strengthen social distribution
networks albeit with a limited role for the state.
On the other hand, the criticisms of the capitalist
economic system and visions of alternative
models have continued to drive the thinkers and
activists alike.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>LIBERALISM</i></strong></div>

In the early modern age of the Western
world (beginning roughly in the early 1500s and
running for about 200 years), a number of
changes occurred that led to new ideologies:
The European discovery of the Americas, the
rise of Protestantism, the beginnings of the freemarket economy, and the early stages of the
scientific revolution fundamentally altered
Europe. People began developing different ways
of thinking to take account of these changes.
Perhaps the most important of the new
ideas is liberalism (also known as classical
liberalism). This type of liberalism, which began
in England in the 1600s, differs from American
liberalism. Classical liberalism developed when
thinkers as John Locke (in his Second Treatise of
Government in 1690) rethought the relationship
between the individual and society, as well
theorized about the rights and responsibilities of
the individual. These ideas formed the foundation
for many political systems still operating today.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Liberalism in Action</i></strong></div>

During the French Revolution (1789–1799),
the monarchy and much of the church were
destroyed, as were traditional laws and habits
in different parts of the country. The
revolutionaries exalted reason, to the point of
literally creating a temple to it (the revolutionaries
renamed the Church of Notre Dame in Paris
“the Temple of Reason”) in 1793. But as a result
of the revolution, France plunged into years of
civil war and violence. Only the emergence of
Napoleon—an authoritarian ruler—brought
stability back to the country.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Liberal Beliefs</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Liberalism emphasizes:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <li>Individualism: The individual takes priority
over society.</li>
        <li>Freedom: Individuals have the right to make
choices for themselves. This freedom is not
absolute, and some behaviours, such as
murder, are prohibited. Freedom of religion
is a particularly important freedom to come
out of liberalism because so many governments at the time were very closely tied to
a particular religious creed.</li>
        <li>Equality: No person is morally or politically
superior to others. Hierarchies are rejected.</li>
        <li>Rationalism: Humans are capable of thinking
logically and rationally. Logic and reason
help us solve problems.</li>
        <li>Progress: Traditions should not be kept
unless they have value. New ideas are helpful
because they can lead to progress in the
sciences, the economy, and society.</li>
        <li>The free market: Liberalism and capitalism
go hand in hand. Liberals like the free market
because it more easily creates wealth, as
opposed to traditional economies, which
often have extensive regulations and limits
on which occupations of people can hold.
These basic characteristics of liberalism
have led liberals to argue in favour of a limited
government, which draws its power from the
people. In practice, this has meant favouring a
democratic government.</li>
        </li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mill’s Good Government</i></strong></div>

In his books On Liberty (1859) and
Considerations of Representative Government
(1861), English philosopher J. S. Mill argued
that good governments should be unrestricting
enough to allow people—both men and womento pursue their own interests and achieve their
own potential as they see fit. Fostering
individuality would, in turn, benefit society as
a whole, because fewer people would feel
restricted or marginalized. Mill also believed
that representative democracy was the best
form of government because it allowed people
to express their individuality and provided them
the opportunity to take a more active role in the
political process. The more active the people are,
Mill thought, the more satisfied they are with
their government.
<br>
<br>
Classical liberalism has profoundly
influenced the modern world, so much so that
we do not even realize how controversial its
ideas were in early modern Europe. Back then,
liberal ideas were considered dangerous and
inflammatory by traditional European
governments, and liberals were frequently
persecuted. Even after liberalism took hold in
England, the rest of Europe was hostile to liberal
ideas for another century (and even longer in
some cases).
<br>
<br>
<b>Example:</b> For centuries, Eastern Europe
suffered greatly from authoritarian rule, in which
one person or a small group holds all the
political power and oppresses everybody else.
As recently as 1989, open discussion of liberal
ideas (such as the free market) or publicly
complaining that the communist governments
did not speak for the people could get a person
arrested. The writer Vaclav Havel, for example,
was jailed by the Czechoslovakian government.
But after the 1989 end of the communist
government in Czechoslovakia, Havel served as
the newly democratic government’s first
President.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Controversial Case of John Locke</i></strong></div>

In the seventeenth century, liberals were
not held in high esteem, as evidenced by the life
of John Locke. Locke was forced to flee into exile
to avoid arrest by the British monarchy. He
returned to England only after the Stuart
monarchs were overthrown in 1688 and a
government friendlier to liberalism took power.
But even then, Locke refused to acknowledge
that he had written Second Treatise of
Government, his main political text, because of
its controversial nature. Other liberals, in
England and elsewhere, were arrested or even
killed by traditional governments.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>CONSERVATISM</i></strong></div>

Conservatism (also known as classical
conservatism) began as a reaction against the
liberal ideas taking hold of Europe during the
French Revolution in the late eighteenth century.
This type of conservatism differs from American
conservatism. Edmund Burke, a British member
of Parliament, observed the early stages of the
French Revolution with great distress and
predicted the violence and terror that would
ensue. His book, Reflections on the Revolution
in France(1790), is one of the founding texts of
classical conservatism.
<br>
<br>
Burke and other conservatives attacked
liberalism for many reasons. They argued that
liberalism destroyed tradition. In its rush to
overturn the old and bring in the new, liberalism
and capitalism ruthlessly attacked traditional
institutions and beliefs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conservative Beliefs</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Conservatism emphasizes:</i></strong></div>
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Stability: Stability is a precious thing, and
change must be made gradually in order to
preserve it. Undermining stability is very
dangerous because societies can easily fall
into chaos and violence. Classical liberals
frequently called for revolution, which opens
the door to great turbulence, according to
the classical conservative view.</li>
        <li>Concreteness: Liberalism is too abstract. It
focuses on freedom and equality, not on the
concrete way people live every day.</li>
        <li>Human fallibility: Liberalism overestimates
human beings. Humans are frequently
ignorant, prejudiced, and irrational. By
ignoring these defects, liberalism becomes
unrealistic.</li>
        <li>Unique circumstances: There is no universal
answer to the problems of society; the circumstances are unique in each country.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Classical Conservatism and Democracy</i></strong></div>

Many early conservatives favoured
authoritarian government. In the aftermath of
the Napoleonic Wars (roughly 1792–1815), for
example, most European governments actively
worked to stop the spread of liberalism and
democracy. Nevertheless, conservatives were
not necessarily hostile to democracy. Generally
these conservatives argued that some sort of
monarchy was necessary, but some were more
open to popular government. Burke, in
particular, thought that limited democracy was
a good form of government for England, as long
as it maintained the customs.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Classical Conservatism Today</i></strong></div>

For the most part, classical conservatism
has faded. Most people who label themselves
conservatives are more like American
conservatives than classical ones. But there are
still some classical conservatives. Many of them
in Europe have ties to old noble families, and
some advocate monarchism. Classical
conservatives can also be found in other parts
of the world.
<br>
<br>
The chart below compares classical liberal
views with classical conservative views on several
issues.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>COMMUNISM</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Socialist Movement</i></strong></div>
With the emergence of a social and economic
system of capitalism, the means of production
such as factories and the things produced by
factories were owned and controlled by a few
people. The vast majority of the people who
worked in the factories had no rights. Their
conditions of work and living were miserable.
They were frequently without jobs. The workers
gradually began to organize themselves into
trade unions to protect their common rights
though for a long time there were laws against
workers combining themselves into unions. The
governments were also forced to pass laws
against some of the worse features of capitalism.
For example Laws to protect workers from
unsafe conditions of work were passed in many
countries. Some progress was also made in
regulating hours of work.
<br>
<br>
Some workers had begun to think that
machines were the cause of their misery. In
England, there was a movement to machines
led the Luddites so named after their leader Ned
Ludd. However, they soon realized that the
destruction of machines would not put an end
to their misery. In England, a new political
movement started which aimed at winning
political rights for workers.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Early Socialists</i></strong></div>

The greatest challenge to capitalism came
from the ideas of socialism and the movements
based on those ideas. The idea grew that
capitalism itself is evil and that it needs to be
replaced by a different kind and economic
system in which the means of production would
be owned by the society as a whole and not by
a few individuals.Many philosophers and
reformers in the past had expressed their
revulsion against inequalities in society and in
favour of a system in which everyone would be
equal. However these ideas had remained as
mere dreams. The French Revolution of 1789
with its promise of equality had given a new
impetus to these ideas. But the French Revolution,

The-wide gap between the aims of the French
Revolution and the actual conditions in France
after the revolution created serious discontent
among the people. It led to an attempt to
overthrow the existing government in France
with a view to building a society based on
socialist ideas. This attempt, known as Babeufs
Conspiracy, is an an important event in the
history of socialism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Babeuf Conspiracy</i></strong></div>

The Conspiracy, as the name indicates,
was the work of Babeuf. He was born in 1760
and had participated in the French Revolution.
He organized a secret society called the Society
of the Equals. Babeuf, in a manifesto, had
declared, “Nature gave everyone an equal right
to the enjoyment of all goods…..In a true society,
there is no room for either rich or poor”. He said
that it was necessary to make another revolution
which would do away “with the terrible
contrasts between rich and poor, masters and
servants. The time has come to set up the
republic of equals, whose welcoming doors will
be open to all mankind.” The society planned
an uprising but the government came to know
of the plan and in May 1796, a large number
of leaders, including Babeuf were arrested.
Babeuf was executed in 1797. Though Babeuf’s
attempt at overthrowing the government had
failed, his ideas exercised an important influence
on the growth of socialist movement.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Utopian Socialists</i></strong></div>

There was another group of socialists in the
early history of socialism which included:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Saint-Simon (1760-1825)</li>
        <li>Charles Fourier (1772-1837)</li>
        <li>Robert Owen (1771-1858)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


They viewed property in relation to its
usefulness to society. They recognized the evils
of capitalism and proposed the establishment of
a new and better system of society in its place.
Saint-Simon coined the slogan, ‘from each
according to his capacity, to each according to
his work‘. They visualized a society free from
exploitation of any kind and one in which all
would contribute their best and would share the
fruits of their labour. However, the methods
they advocated for the establishment of such a
society were impracticable and ineffective. Hence
they came to be called utopian socialists.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Communist League</i></strong></div>

Many groups and organisations were also
formed to spread socialist ideas and organise
workers. One of these was the League of the Just
which had members in many countries of
Europe. Its slogan was ‘All men are brothers’.
Thus internationalism was one of its important
features. In 1847, its name was changed to the
Communist League and it declared as its aim,
“the downfall of the bourgeoisie, the rule of the
proletariat, the overthrow of the old society of
middle class, based on class distinction, and the
establishment of a new society without classes
and without private property.” Its journal
carried the slogan, “Proletarians of all lands,
unite!” It instructed Karl Marx and Friedrich
Engels to draft a manifesto.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Marxian Socialism</i></strong></div>

The Communist Manifesto first appeared
in German in February 1848. The influence of
this document in the history of the socialist
movement is without a rival. It was the work
of Karl Marx (1818-83) and his lifelong associate
Friedrich Engels (1820-M). Both Marx and Engels
were born in Germany, but spent much of their
life outside Germany, mostly in England.
Through their work in the socialist movement
and through their numerous writings, they gave
a new direction to socialist ideology and
movement. Their philosophy is known as
Marxism and it has influenced almost every
field of knowledge. Their view of socialism is
called scientific socialism.
<br>
<br>
The Communist Manifesto stated that the
aim of workers all over the world was the
overthrow of capitalism and the establishment
of socialism. “In place of the old bourgeois
society, with its classes and class differences”,
it said “appears an association in which the free
development of each is the condition for the free
development of all”. It pointed out that socialism
was not merely desirable, but also inevitable.
Capitalism, it said, does not serve the needs of
man and, like other social and economic systems
in history, it would be replaced by a system,
better suited to human needs. Marx analysed
the working of capitalism in his famous work Das
Kapital (Capital) and pointed out the
characteristics that would lead to its destruction.
According to him,
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Workers produce more ‘value’ than they get
in the form of wages, the difference being
appropriated by the capitalists in the form
of profits.</li>
        <li>This constitutes the basis of conflict in
capitalist society. Profits can be increased at
the cost of workers’ wages and, therefore,
the interests of workers and capitalists are
irreconcilable.</li>
        <li>Economic crises were inevitable under
capitalism because of the discrepancy
between the purchasing power of workers
and total production. These crises would be
resolved only if the private ownership of the
means of production is abolished and the
profit motive eliminated from the system of
production. With this, production would be
carried on for social good rather than for
profits for a few.</li>
        <li>The exploiting classes would disappear and
a classless society would emerge in which
there would be no difference between what
was good for the individual and for society
as a whole.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


Marx and Engels believed that this would
be accomplished by the working class which
was the most revolutionary class in capitalist
society. They advocated that the emancipation
of the working class would emancipate the
whole human race from all traces of social
injustice.
<br>
<br>
Around the time the Communist Manifesto
was published, revolutions broke out in almost
every country in Europe. These revolts aimed at
the overthrow of autocratic governments,
establishment of democracy and also, in countries
such as Italy and Germany, at national
unification. One of the major forces in these
revolutions were the workers who had been
inspired by ideas of socialism. The Communist
League participated in these revolutions in many
countries. However, all these revolutions were
suppressed.
Writings of Karl Marx showed that capitalist
mode of production generates four types of
alienation: alienation of man in the workplace;
alienation of man from his product; alienation
of man from his species life; and, alienation of
man from man. For human beings, work is a
means of self-expression and development of
one’s potential. However, in capitalism work
ceases to fulfil this requirement. The industrial
unit divides the work of production into small
fragments; it compartmentalizes jobs such that
each individual repeatedly performs the same
differentiated and narrowly specialized task.
Under these circumstances, work becomes a
routine, if not a drudgery. The instrumental
rationality that governs the workplace also
extends to the social space.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect of Communism (Socialist Movement) on
Society:</i></strong></div>

Soviet Union constituted a unique culture,
talked in terms of the "Soviet people", and
proclaimed the birth of a new community,
recognizable as a Soviet nationalism. Despite
the fact, that it was carried out in the name of
internationalism and denouncing nationalism,
which meant no more than suppressing certain
non-socialist ideological brands of nationalism.
Sayer provides a perspective on the broader
implications of the economic analyses by Karl
Marx of capitalism and the social analysis by
Max Weber of the same phenomenon. Sayer’s
essay indicates how industrial capitalism and
capitalism generally (in the way Braudel deals
with it), has generated “modernity” and a
preoccupation with “modernity”; industrial
capitalism cannot be associated purely with
economic transitions and its limited social
consequences, even over the long term. It is part
of much broader developments.
<br>
<br>
Sayer points out that Marx did not
associated capitalism with specifically economic
features. Rather, Marx thought of it as a stage
of development. Asserting the importance of
wage labour and general “commoditization” as
crucial features of capitalism, Marx stressed,
though, that what was most significant to such
capitalism was that it affects almost all social
relations. Once the process is set in motion, it
“revolutionizes both the material production
processes and the social relation on which it
rests”.
Craft workers are brought into a single
workshop and subordinated to a single capitalist,
enabling greater labour discipline. Production
also is co-operative, in the sense that there now
appears a detailed division of labour in the
workshop and in society; and it is competitive.
During this phase, such processes are “more or
less accidental.” But, during the next phase,
that of Modern Industry, these processes “are
the rule,” and there is a transformation to the
extent to which labour is subordinate to capital.
“Things” (or “commodities”) become crucial to
all relationships; all “use value” is an aspect of
“exchange value”.
<br>
<br>
Later writers, Sayer points out, such as
Max Weber, Michel Foucault or Norbert Elias,
have disputed the factors on which this broad
socio-economic and cultural transformation
rests. If, for Marx, it is the product of a complex
economic process, for Weber it is the consequence
of a cultural process which does not exclude
economic implications, but was fundamental to
it. For Michel Foucault, it is the change in the
discursive paradigm of society that is crucial to
capitalism and modernity, while, for Norbert,
Elias, it is the very personal discipline of
individuals in society.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Class Struggle</i></strong></div>

In Middle Ages, three most basic social
groups were: those who fought as mounted
knights (the landed nobility), those who prayed
and 'looked after' the spiritual welfare of society
(the clergy) and those who laboured in fields
and shops (the peasantry and village artisans).
After the revival of towns there emerged a
fourth social group, the distance traders and
merchants. The central axis of the medieval
economy was the relationship between the
landed aristocracy and the peasantry, as much
rooted in the specific relations of production as
modern class relationships are. The landed
aristocracy derived its income from the
ownership of land, on which it did not perform
any economic function.
<br>
<br>
The clergy derived their special place as
first estate through their self-proclaimed role as
mediator between God and humanity, and by
virtue of this role enjoyed a number of privileges,
chief among them the exemption of taxation for
themselves and the Church as an institution.
There was transition to a modern class society
which had no place for privilege based on birth,
status and legal shackles
The challenge to the feudal social structures
came from the class struggles of the peasantry
and the bourgeoisie, and the Nation-State as a
political formation. In the new nation states
there was a natural alliance between the
bourgeoisie and the monarchies. They opposed
tolls, tariffs and other petty regulations that
restricted trade and other commercial activity.
The towns and the bourgeoisie became major
forces in the transition from feudal societies to
modern class societies organized as nation states.
The estate system was modified, and not
completely undermined, once the economic
relationships that sustained them were eroded.
These two new classes- a bourgeoisie spread
out into the commercial, financial and industrial
sectors; and a proletariat in agriculture and
industry, initiated a transformation of the social
spectrum by the 18th century. However, the
18th century continued to be the age of the
dominance of the landed aristocracy, though
this aristocracy itself was now rooted in the
emerging capitalism.
<br>
<br>
The emergence and development of modern
class society parallels the birth of the nationsstate and emergence of the nation as an
organizing principle. In fact the political form
given to the modern society was that of a
nation. The French Revolution in democratizing
the concept of the nation to guarantee the
fundamental rights of all people also legitimized
the link between the two. The transition to
citizenship from being subjects of kings and
queens was inseparably linked to equality before
law as well as private property and a unified
market.
<br>
<br>
During the course of the 19th century the
press, the educational system, the religious
movements, and the inter-imperialist rivalries
contributed to the strengthening of national
identities and the growth of self-conscious
nationalist movements. In Italy, Germany and
Central Europe, they represented powerful
forces, and incorporated the class interests of
the lesser gentry and the emerging middle class.
Yet, it is worthwhile remembering that national
identity did not really diminish class affiliations.
The struggle for vote, equal wages for equal
work, inheritance rights and various
manifestations of patriarchy contributed to
awareness of gender issues. This is a view that
does not remain uncontested. Perceptions apart,
classes remain a basic reality of contemporary
society, and class solidarities still retain
considerable significance. The reality of all wage
labour under capitalism today is that it is still
necessarily exploitative and organized in the
interest of Capital. Class relations may have
become mystified or hidden under the force of
media, and more sophisticated forms of
production and consumption, but the
relationship between Capital and labour retains
its essential contradiction in the post-industrial
capitalist social order.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Communism Today</i></strong></div>

With the fall of communist regimes in
Russia and Eastern Europe, communism has
been in retreat for most of the 1990s and 2000s.
There are, for example, fewer communist
movements around the world than during the
Cold War. But there are still several major
communist regimes, including the governments
of North Korea and Cuba.
<br>
<br>
<b>Democratic socialism:</b> A peaceful and
democratic approach to achieving socialism. As
an ideology, democratic socialism also
emphasizes a classless society in which all
members jointly share the means and output of
production. But unlike communism, democratic
socialism attempts to achieve its goals peacefully
via the democratic processes. Democratic
socialists reject the need for immediate transition
to socialism in favour of a gradualist approach,
achieved by working within a democratic
government. Economic inequalities should be
remedied through a welfare state, a system that
provides aid to the poor and help to the
unemployed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Democratic Socialism Today</i></strong></div>

Democratic socialism has been quite
successful in western Europe and Scandinavia.
Many governments there have extensive welfare
systems that have remained largely intact even
when democratic socialists are voted out of
office. Democratic socialist parties exist in many
democracies around the world. Germany’s Social
Democratic Party and Britain’s Labour Party
are contemporary examples of successful political
parties heavily influenced by democratic
socialism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DEMOCRACY</i></strong></div>

20th century saw an unparalleled extension
of democracy in terms of both its inclusiveness
as well as its spatial expansion. Beginning with
the extension of the suffrage to women in the
older western democracies, and ending with the
dismantling of apartheid in South Africa,
democracy in the 20th century surely became
more inclusive. 21st century is witnessing the
same expansion both vertically and horizontally.
Horizontal expansion evident in the fact that
new areas as in Arab States and North Africa
are experimenting with one of the most
revolutionary and addictive political thought
i.e. Democracy. At the same time vertical
expansion can be noticed in increasing emphasis
on inclusion of local communities in governance
model across the States. In India same is visible
in enhanced efforts to empower the 3rd tier of
democracy i.e. PRIs and ULBs. (Panchayati Raj
Institutions and Urban Local Bodies).
An understanding of modern democracy is
not possible without an account of the social
and political ideas, as well as of the patterns of
material development in the economic and
productive spheres of the societies in which
modern democracy took birth. But describing
each and every change at the same time will
lead to problem like lack of coherence and
repetitions of ideas and changes. Students must
note that changes that led to emergence of
industrialization, capitalism, communism,
nationalism, colonialism and de-colonialism were
not compartmentalized but rather were acting
simultaneously and effectively on society and
modern man. Now a brief history and analysis
of the philosophy of Democracy follows and it
is suggested to students to follow the above
mentioned advice of referring cross cutting
themes while understanding History of World
in modern times.
<br>
<br>
Democracy in the city-state of Athens is
considered to be the most stable, enduring and
model form of democracy in Greece in ancient
times. But this had its own exclusivist
weaknesses.
Modern Democracies Flourished in West
Britain is regarded as the first modern
democracy because after Civil War (1640-1649),
royal absolutism was brought to an end, and
powers were transferred from the Crown to the
two Houses of Parliament. Though, universal
adult suffrage was only fully achieved in 1948,
when plural voting was abolished in favour of
the principle of one-person one-vote.
More radical tradition of democracy in
France was inaugurated by the French
Revolution of 1789, with its stirring call of
Liberty-Equality Fraternity. In the United States
of America, too, the advance of democracy in
the aftermath of the Civil War was restricted to
white men, and the enfranchisement of women,
as also of indigenous and black people was not
achieved until the twentieth century.
Nationalism and democracy are two ideas
that fundamentally differentiate modern state
from earlier states. Modern state differs from the
pre-modern state in, how it exercises vast,
centralized and bureaucratic power, and also
how it legitimizes its rule through the doctrine
of the sovereignty of the people. It thus mobilizes
support for the state, especially through
nationalism, which is a form of imposing a
uniform culture over a political territory.
<br>
<br>
It mobilizes support through the modern
political party, which is an invention of the
nineteenth century; and modern politics could
be conducted through either the multi-party
system called pluralist or the single-party system,
often called totalitarian or dictatorial. But
citizen’s function in modern politics by the
exercise of rights which they possess at birth
and which cannot be denied to them subsequently; they thus organize themselves into all
types of groups independent of the state. This
is often called democratic; but it is more
important to realize that modern citizens are
capable of being more active politically than
ever before, whether the state be democratic or
not; and that complements the state’s capacity
to mobilize them to action on a scale unknown
in history. These two tendencies combine to
produce modern politics, the active citizen and
the mobilizing bureaucratic state.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Initial Democracies: Liberty Rather Than
Equality</i></strong></div>

Beginning of democratic theory is
distinguished by a strong emphasis on the
concept of liberty, rather than the concept of
equality with which it later came to be identified.
The idea that God spoke directly to individuals,
without the mediation of priests, also made
possible and legitimate the questioning of
political authority. In modern world, struggle
for democracy everywhere and throughout
history, has been a struggle against political
inequality based on, and often justified by,
inequalities of birth and wealth.
Industrial capitalism created new social
classes which questioned the stranglehold of the
older elites, whose power was based entirely in
the ownership of land, and demanded a share
in political power. Gradually, the middle and
working classes also became more vocal and
assertive in claiming rights of political
participation.
<br>
<br>
Centrality of the state naturally resulted in
greater pressures for controlling the state and
sharing in the power and the resources that it
commanded. In Western societies, capitalist
industrialization is widely believed to have been
a powerful impetus to democratization. Patterns
of economic development effected significant
changes in the nature of class forces and class
divisions, and both these interacted with the
state and political institutions to redefine society
and politics.
<br>
<br>
However, outside of the west, social theorists
have many different explanations for the varied
routes through which democratization occurs.
The 'real world of democracy', as said by C.B.
MacPherson, has been populated by many
variants of democracy: from bourgeois
democracy to socialist and even communist
versions, each of which has insisted that its form
of democracy is the truest and most genuine.
For societies which attach greater significance
to the community that to the individual, the
democratic part of liberal-democracy (such as
free elections and freedom of speech) is more
universalizable than its liberal component.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau is the premier
philosopher of democracy, with his faith in the
direct participation of the citizens in the making
of laws. John Stuart Mill expressed his fear of
the tyranny of the majority. Karl Marx’s attitude
to democracy was somewhat ambivalent. Even
as he viewed bourgeois democracy as inherently
flawed, on account of its class character, Marx
nevertheless endorsed the battle for democracy
as an important stepping-stone on the journey
of the proletariat towards revolutionary change.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Democracy and Feudalism</i></strong></div>

Even as ideas of the French Revolutionliberty, equality and fraternity, popular
sovereignty and nation as constituted of the
entire people, led to the birth of modern politics
and modern public opinion, representative
institutions throughout Europe continued to
exclude people as representatives. Democracy
continued to be interpreted in the light of the
interests of the propertied classes. The House of
Lords in Parliament represented by the richest
four hundred families in Britain continued the
tradition of the 'estate' of the nobility, even after
the composition of the House of Commons
changed in favour of the 'commoners' through
a series of Reform Acts of Parliament.
These political institutional arrangements
hampered constitutionalism and handicapped
the class struggles for greater political democracy.
Destruction of Feudalism (which was one
of the biggest danger to Democratic Spirit) was
a slow process. The first artisans destroyed
machinery which they saw as destroying their
livelihood and way of life, subsequently evolving
into the first trade-unionists. The emergence of
a factory proletariat finally led to the dichotomy
of capital and labour as the primary
contradiction in the modern class society. With
the emergence of capital as the dominant element
in economic production, the bourgeoisie became
the representative of status quo, and the class
struggles of the working class the moving forces
of history. As Marx pointed out, a class had
been created whose emancipation could result
in the end of class exploitation itself. The birth
of modern politics, as expressed through the
ideals of the French Revolution and the following
revolutions of 1830 and 1848 meant primarily
that no privilege could any more remain
unquestioned. The forces of democracy
unleashed by these revolutions ended all
legitimacy of estates.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Challenges to Democracy in Contemporary
Times</i></strong></div>

In the 'realist' account of Joseph Schumpeter
who said that the classical, 18th century definition
of democracy (as an institutional arrangement
for arriving at political decisions by making the
people decide issues through the election of
legislators to carry out their will) was flawed
because the people were ignorant, irrational
and apathetic, and therefore the principle of
popular sovereignty was meaningless. Among
the important challenges to democracy at the
beginning of the 21st century, the following
may be identified:
    <ol>
        <ul>
            <li>Development or rather 'Lack of Development'.</li>
            <li>Disrespect for Diversity by Democratic
Neutrality.</li>
            <li>Gender and Democracy in Patriarchal State.</li>
            <li>Globalization and Loss of Democratic
Credentials.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>

Democracy is potentially a powerful
weapon against poverty and deprivation. But
slow pace of development in many countries,
including India is often attributed to adoption
of Democracy. The neutrality of democratic
theory becomes a problem, as it prevents special
consideration from being given to those citizens
whose formal equality is undermined by the
disadvantage and prejudices that they are
subject to by virtue of their cultural identity.
Communitarian critics of liberalism have argued
that individuals are not the autonomous presocial creatures that liberal theory makes them
out to be. Rather, they are formed and constituted
by the traditions and communities in which
they are formed and constituted by the traditions
and communities in which they are located.
Feminists argue that the customary division
between the private and the public realm tends
to relegate women to the private sphere
characterized by subordination to patriarchal
power and lack of freedom, while democracy is
restricted to the essentially male-oriented public
sphere. Globalization, as we know, increases
the intensity of transnational flows of trade,
finance, capital, technology, information and
culture. Thus, it makes it difficult for democratic
governments-particularly in the countries of the
South-to control their own affairs internally and
in a self-contained way.
<br>
<br>
The new institutions of global governance,
such as the International Monetary Fund or the
World Trade Organization, perform regulatory
functions but themselves are organised in ways
that are not democratic or accountable. On the
contrary, they reflect and reinforce the
asymmetries of global power relations.
Despite the shortcomings, the fact that all
manner of political regimes have sought to
appropriate the label 'democracy' to legitimize
themselves, clearly shows that it carries a positive
normative connotation. And democracy is here
to stay for long. Recent Arab spring clearly
shows the desire and temptation of human
nature towards democratic principles.
Democracy goes far beyond the formal,
constitutional, and ideological restriction of that
label to one type of regime, whether it be liberal,
counter-revolutionary, or communist. However,
limited, coerced, "unfair", or "distorted" the
electoral process, no regime could do in past
and can do in present without it.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Effect of Democracy on Society</i></strong></div>

Throughout history, democracy has been
called many things. Merriam-Webster defines
"democracy" as "government by the people; a
form of government in which the supreme
power is vested in the people and exercised
directly by them or by their elected agents under
a free electoral system." Former American
President Abraham Lincoln called democracy,
"... the government of the people, by the people
and for the people." However, former United
Kingdom Prime Minister Winston Churchill
said, "The strongest argument against democracy
is a five minute discussion with the average
voter." Regardless of how we praise and criticize
democracy, it is evident that democracy has
played a major card in the shaping of modern
society. We will explore why and how democracy
has accomplished this.
<br>
<br>
Before one can know the impact democracy
has had on the world, one must take a look at
its history. While its birth can't exactly be
pinpointed, historians do know that ancient
civilizations employed forms of democracy. The
world's first republic, Vaishali, is part of a group
of ancient republics known as the Maha
Janapadas. Vaishali and the other Maha
Janapadas developed and used democratic
systems named Sangha, Gana and Panchayat.
Sangha, meaning "community", was more of a
religious brotherhood rather than a complete
democratic system; however, the elements are
in place. Decisions in the sangha were enacted
by everyone. Each individual in the sangha had
equal decisive power and emphasis was put on
participation in the sangha. The gana system
was slightly more organized. "Gana" could refer
to many things, such as tribes, troops, class, etc.
but is commonly used to refer to a governing
body. The various ganas would have chiefs
making the important decisions if the public
could not agree on a topic. Out of the three
ancient forms of democracy, Panchayat is the
closest to modern day democracy. Panchayat is
still utilized in some parts of the world today.
<br>
<br>
In Panchayat, elders are elected by the village
council. These elders would mediate arguments
amongst the people. Throughout the ages, other
nations had similar democratic elements in their
government. For example, the Roman Empire
was known as the Roman Republic before its
government system changed from a republic to
the quasi-monarch such as in the time of Julius
Caesar. During this period, officials were elected
by the citizens. Citizens were divided into
different castes with various powers, but all
citizens were allowed to vote. Even in the days
of the American Indian, democracy in various
stages can be found. The Iroquois Indian used
a very loose form of democracy to govern the
people. Certain males were born into a leadership
caste. Only the members of this caste could
become leaders. Furthermore, only women of
the same caste could remove the leaders.
Understanding democracy's evolution throughout history is key to understanding the impact
it has had on the world. These are just a few
points in the history of democracy. As we can
see with the preceding examples, democracy
has had an extremely long and rich history,
weaving in and out of various cultures.
This evolution of democracy has allowed
the world to grow towards a world where fear
and oppression is eliminated. One way this is
occurring is by democratic countries' promotion
of education. Education and democracy go
hand in hand. Democratic countries tend to
allow more freedoms, such as freedom of
information. With information being readily
available, it is much easier for education to
thrive, as opposed to an authoritarian
government that would restrict information.
Democracy also promotes freedom from the
government, as a leader that is deemed unfit
can be easily eliminated from office. This can
result in more educated and intelligent leaders
that fit the bill properly.
<br>
<br>
Democracy is not without its criticisms,
however. When Churchill stated, "the strongest
argument against democracy is a five minute
discussion with the average voter," he may have
been referring to the difficulty of understanding
a democratic government and how it functions.
If the average voter is not thoroughly educated
in the system, they may not know the
ramifications of the decisions they vote or not
vote on. Classic philosopher Plato addressed
this concern in his writings. He believed that a
system where the citizens were ruled by only
the intelligent would benefit society more. A
finance capitalist in Australia was cited saying,
"It's a strange system. I mean, after all, why
should a kid of eighteen have the same value of
vote as I do". Perhaps one of the biggest criticisms
of democracy is that it is value-neutral. This can
have a profound effect on society. Robert Kaplan
in his essay "Was Democracy Just a Moment"
points out that both Hitler and Mussolini arose
to power through democracy. Kaplan's
argument there isn't that democracy is the cause
of dictators rising to power, but that democracy
exposes a society's health. It is amazing to see
the various systems and their effects on society.
There isn't a "right" or "wrong" way to govern
people. In the end, it all boils down to what a
person values the most. Some may value freedom
of information, others may value stability. Either
way, the effect will be profound and will touch
everyone.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Brief comparison of Societal effect of
Communism and Democracy</i></strong></div>

Communism, a well known form of
socialism, is a government system revolving
around full equality amongst the working class.
Philosopher Karl Marx is known as "the father
of communism". Marx was an opponent of
capitalism who believed that communism would
end capitalism, just as capitalism ended feudalism
before. While communism does have its economic
element, we will focus on the government aspect
in order to fairly compare and contrast the
ideology against democracy. In theory and on
paper, communism appears to create a utopian,
classless society free of government. However,
in practice this has not occurred. Communism
has come under fire by many opponents,
especially human rights activists. It appears that
mankind has perverted communism from the
theory it was into means of control. While some
may argue that it is not fair to say communism
has caused a negative impact on the world
because communism isn't the practice as the
theory was originally conceived, we can only
compare what has been enacted in the world.
China, a communist nation is an example of this
situation. The Chinese government has
oppressed its people and plunged the nation
into fear. Many cases of human right violation
and other fundamental rights violation are
common in China. Again the theory of
communism itself cannot be blamed for the
Chinese government's actions. However, in the
current communist governments, the workers
labour for government owned companies. This
creates an environment almost akin to slavery.
In a democratic society, the workers can oust
corrupt leaders that harm society rather than
help. It is in this sense that democracy's impact
on society is much more positive than
communism.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WELFARE STATE</i></strong></div>

Welfare can be defined as a citizen's
entitlement over and beyond his current
contribution to national income. This thought
increasingly displaced charity from the early
19th century and the same began to be
undertaken by the state in a comprehensive
fashion.
<br>
<br>
In the pre-modern time charity and welfare
were tasks that were generally performed by the
family, community or the religious establishment.
In modern times, however, the state looks upon
welfare as a part of its responsibility and handles
it in an institutionalized manner. In the pre
modern period, the individuals could appeal to
the Church or religious groups, family or the
community when faced with poverty or illness
and the causes of poverty were often seen either
in fate or in individual failure.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Roots in Industrialization</i></strong></div>

Economic development as well as social
dislocation marked the capitalist transformation
of the world during 1750-1850. In this situation
ideas about relief and charity began to change.
The reform sentiment that gathered momentum
during this period affected a range of social
policies.
<br>
<br>
Roots of modern welfare state are traced to
Industrialization. Industrialization brought with
it economic growth but also the growth of
urban centres where an increasing class of
people lived at subsistence levels. The modern
state began to tackle the social problems that
arose out of this through measures that grew in
coverage both out of a strong sense of
humanitarian concern as well as because of a
fear of social unrest.
<br>
<br>
Different Approaches for A Welfare State
Britain was the 1st state to experience
Industrialization and it was here only that
initial contours of welfare state were drawn for
the first time. A whole body of legislation
developed the welfare state. Not just the poor
but all citizens were entitled to a variety of social
benefits such as a minimum wage, access to
public health systems and schemes were
established for social insurance such as old age
pensions, or unemployment benefits.
Elizabethan Poor Laws were codified in
1597-1598. Under these laws a compulsory tax
was imposed on each household and this money
was used to provide relief to the aged, the infirm
but not the 'sturdy beggar'. The able-bodied
poor were punished.
<br>
<br>
Germany under the leadership of Otto von
Bismarck was the first country to adopt
comprehensive social legislation. Bismarck was
motivated by a political vision glorifying the
nation and an economic vision that stressed
national self-sufficiency and paternalism. He
also sought to counter the threat posed by the
demands of a socialist movement. The workers
health was important to the nation because the
worker was also the soldier that protected the
state. The duty of the State, according to
Bismarck was to regulate all aspects of life in the
national interest. To make the nation strong it
was necessary to help the weaker citizens.
German welfare system provided the most
comprehensive protection to workers in all of
Europe and became a model that many copied.
Unlike these policies that were marked by
obligatory help on a long term basis, in pre
modern Japan ideas of welfare were based on
an ideology of benevolent rule where the ruler
helped to mitigate the sufferings of his people
through timely help. Japan had a special model
in which wealthy merchants were involved in
charity and taking care of the urban poor in
cities like Edo (Tokyo), Kyoto and Osaka.
Besides this, Confucian ideas of filial piety
and diligence were adopted while propagating
a self-help approach to take care of poor. It was
argued that even poor peasants by working
hard, being thrifty and improving productivity
by using new agricultural method could improve
their lot and become wealthy. However, while
promoting self-help a poor person was not seen
as the individual but rather as the community.
After the restoration of Meiji Government
(1868), government instituted a series of measures
to set up the institutional structure of a modern
state system grounded in the belief that it was
the responsibility of the state to create a strong
and prosperous country. The state worked
through private relief efforts in time of
emergencies and this policy proved successful
because Japan was still largely an agrarian
society. These were subsequent cuts in the
central budget and the responsibility was shifted
to municipalities. Government efforts were
directed at preventing poverty through moral
instructions. Rather than poor relief the
government focused in rebuilding the
community.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Mainstreaming Welfare: Democracy and
Popular Opinion</i></strong></div>

Electoral reforms allowed greater
participation and in turn Parliament was made
more sensitive to Popular opinion and became
the vehicle for realizing social legislation. The
question of who are the poor was central in
much of the debates and proposals for social
legislation. Poverty and its relief were now
transformed into a social problem that required
a different approach. It was no longer a matter
of providing relief but services and these not just
to a particular group of people but to all citizens.
However, the general democratization of
politics and greater political participation
through the electoral process changed the forms
of social control and placed greater reliance on
internalized moral and cultural mechanisms.
Relief and charity expanded and were
transformed through social legislation that sought
to provide for the needs of all its citizens from
'cradle to grave'. The post world war 2 years
influenced by the economic crisis and
unemployment before the war and sense of
crisis during the war fuelled the resurgence of
left wing movements all over Europe. People
increasingly demanded that the state had an
obligation to secure the well being of its citizens.
Bureaucrats saw society as the unit at
which poverty could be tackled and this view
was grounded in social theories emanating from
Europe that said the state had a public
responsibility. However, even while the state's
obligation to relieve poverty now became the
key element in social policy earlier ideas need
not be jettisoned. But today, the family system
must be stressed more. Also the idea that, public
assistance must not create dependency, continue
to be a major strain in designing welfare policies
e.g. MGNREGA scheme has been questioned
even in government circles that it may lead to
reduced efforts by population towards gaining
skills and may dent the demographic dividend
by leading to a dependency syndrome.
The questions that are raised when welfare
policies are initially formulated inter alia include,
does state support lead to dependence and loss
of initiative, does the financial costs place an
unacceptable burden on those who do not
benefit from these policies, and do entitlements
or reservations create special interest groups.
These questions remain as engrossing as in past
and finding a widely acceptable strategy in this
arena remains elusive dream for all States that
aspire to be a Welfare State.
