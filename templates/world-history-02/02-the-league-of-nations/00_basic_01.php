<h3>The League of Nations</h3>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Introduction</i></strong></div>

American President Woodrow Wilson
intended the League of Nations to be the primary
body of a new style of international relations
based on the cooperation of all of the nations of
the world. The League was to be centered in
Geneva, Switzerland, a neutral location. Small
nations as well as large nations were asked to
join, dependent on their acceptance of the
Covenant of the League. The League of Nations
first met in November 1920. Forty-two nations
were represented at this first meeting. Notably
absent were German, Russia, and the United
States. Germany, identified as the aggressor in
World War I, was barred from admission at
first, and admitted in 1926. Russia, now the
Soviet Union, was not invited to join the League
due to the radical policies of the new communist
government. The Soviet Union finally became a
member of the League in 1935. In November
1919, the US Senate voted against accepting
membership to the League, and the nation
never joined.
<br>
<br>
The League of Nations operated through
three agencies: the Assembly, the Council, and
the Secretariat. The Assembly met annually,
and consisted of a delegation from each member
nation. Each member had one vote. The Council
was composed of four permanent members and
four nonpermanent members, serving as a sort
of cabinet, with some executive powers. The
Council was responsible for the prevention of
war through disarmament, resolving disputes,
and supervising the mandates of the League.
The Secretariat was the League's civil service,
preparing the agenda for the Assembly and the
Council, serving a clerical purpose, and
preparing documents for publication.
The League of Nations succeeded in
providing assistance to bankrupt nations,
supervising its mandates, and resolving conflicts
between minor powers. During the early 1920s,
the League made two attempts to outline a
mechanism by which international conflicts
could be contained and resolved. Both methods
aimed to identify the aggressor nation and
pledge League support to the victim. The Treaty
of Mutual Assistance, the first of these two
efforts, was drafted in 1923. It proposed that the
Council should declare which side of a conflict
was the aggressor within four days of the
outbreak of the conflict, at which point the
League's members would automatically have to
support the victim nation. The treaty failed, due
to consensus that deciding which side of a
conflict was the aggressor was far too difficult
to do in just four days and without any concrete
guidelines. The treaty also mandated military
participation on the part of the member nations,
a clause distasteful to many. In 1925, the League
tried once again to outline a mechanism for the
containment of war. The Geneva Protocol
provided for compulsory arbitration of international disputes by the League. Any nation
unwilling to submit to the League's arbitration
would be declared the aggressor. This proposal
was brought down by the British delegation,
whose overseas colonial leaders feared that they
would be dragged into European affairs by the
Geneva Protocol.
<br>
<br>
The League of Nations was at first heralded
as the bastion of a new system of international
relations in Europe. The so-called 'old diplomacy'
is known as the Westphalian System, since it
had been in place since the Treaty of Westphalia,
signed at the end of the Thirty Years War in
1648 by the major European powers. Under the
Westphalian system the elites of government
often met in secret to determine the fate of
Europe and the world. World War I shattered
the old system along with the empires that had
maintained it. American participation in the
war was a major step toward a shift in the
balance of world power, and the beginning of
the end for European dominance. The brutality,
and to some, apparent needlessness, of the war
and the changing face of European geography
led to new ideas about how international affairs
should be managed. The secretive nature of the
Westphalian system had led to petty resentments,
the pursuit of narrow self-interest, and the
division of Europe into warring camps. Many,
including Woodrow Wilson, felt that a more
open, all- inclusive system would be more
fostering to cooperation, a concept of
international justice, and peace. The League
was seen as a way to institutionalize these goals
and strive for peace as a collective world
community.
<br>
<br>
The League of Nations was an organization
wrecked by contradictions and insufficiencies
from the start. Membership was determined by
the acceptance of the Covenant of the League,
which stated the goals and philosophy upon
which it was founded. The covenant, however,
had been drafted by small committees behind
closed doors, thus violating the spirit of "open
covenants openly arrived at" expounded by the
Covenant of the League itself. This contradiction
foreshadowed similar crises of ideology in the
future for the League. The United State's failure
to join the League of Nations was a major blow
to the hopes of its founders, and to Wilson's
view on the character of the 'new diplomacy.'
It also marked the beginning of a period of US
isolationism, which kept the US effectively out
of European political affairs for the majority of
the inter-war period.
The founding and structure of the League
of Nations was established primarily for the
purpose of preventing future wars, a new
concept for Europeans who traditionally believed
that war was a necessary and inevitable
outgrowth of international relations. However,
the League could not come to a decision on how
best to do this, without infringing on the
sovereignty of the member countries, as would
have been the case if the Treaty of Mutual
Assistance or the Geneva Protocol had been
passed. The failure of these two measures left
the League with only the power to invoke
economic sanctions against a nation determined
to be the aggressor in a conflict, and greatly
called into question the authority and ability of
the League to mediate conflicts. The League of
Nations thus exercised only limited powers, and
did so clumsily. Most powerful nations preferred
to manage their affairs outside of the League,
only rarely deferring to the League's authority.
Despite these shortcomings, the League of
Nations did accomplish some of its unification
and pacification goals, and perhaps most
importantly, set the stage for the United Nations,
which would take its place after World War II.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Attempts at Reconciliation and Disarmament
(1921-1930)</i></strong></div>

Though the League of Nations failed to
pass any broad measures to achieve a lasting
peace, the former Allies and Germany were
reconciled on December 1, 1925 with the signing
of the Locarno Pacts. The Pacts were intended
to assuage French fears of resurgent German
aggression. They included guarantees on the
French-German and Belgian-German borders,
signed by those three nations and with Britain
and Italy acting as guarantors, promising to
provide military assistance to the victim of any
violation of peace along those borders. The
Locarno Pacts also included treaties between
Germany and Poland, Czechoslovakia, Belgium,
and France, providing for the settlement of
potential territorial disputes. Additionally,
French-Polish and French-Czechoslovakian
mutual assistance treaties were signed in case of
German aggression.
<br>
<br>
The League of Nations, for its part, moved
from its focus on settling conflicts to attempts to
disarm the European militaries which had been
built up during the war. In this arena it fared
little better than it had in the latter. Disarmament
was a major goal of the League. Article III of the
Covenant of the League called for "reduction of
armaments to the lowest point consistent with
national safety." However, despite this priority,
the first major arms treaty was negotiated
outside of the League, in November 1921. The
United States convened the Washington
Conference, attended by Britain, France, Italy,
Belgium, the Netherlands, China, Japan, and
Portugal. The Conference resulted in a naval
armaments treaty which set a ratio for tonnage
of capital ships (over 10,000 tons, with guns
bigger than eight inches) for Great Britain, the
US, Japan, France, and Italy. The ratio agreed
upon, in that order, was 5:5:3:1.67:1.67.
In 1925, the League of Nations appointed
a commission to prepare a disarmament
conference. The commission met first in 1926,
and a number of times subsequently, all without
success. Britain and France refused to cooperate,
and without their participation, disarmament
floundered. The League's inability to promote
disarmament led United States Secretary of
State Frank Kellogg and French Foreign Minister
Aristide Briand to jointly denounce war in the
1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, which stated that the
signing parties condemned recourse to war, and
denounced it as an aspect of policy. The pact
was eventually ratified, often hesitantly, by 65
nations. Some nations signed while claiming
exceptions for self-defense and such. The
Kellogg-Briand Pact had no enforcement mechanism, but was based rather on the affirmation
of the spirit of peace.
<br>
<br>
The last major League of Nations-sponsored
disarmament conference met from February to
July 1932 at Geneva, with 60 nations in
attendance, including the United States.
However, this conference, like it's predecessors,
failed to secure any agreement, and organized
disarmament remained an unaccomplished goal.
The treaties of the Locarno Pacts were the
major part of France's efforts to surround
Germany with French allies and discourage
German aggression. Somewhat to France's
dismay, the treaties worked to usher in a period
of good relations between Germany and its
neighbors. The frequently referred to 'spirit of
Locarno' had a positive psychological effect
throughout Europe and many believed a lasting
peace would grow from that root. The Locarno
Pacts were also important in that they
represented a revival of traditional power politics
and a rejection of the League of Nations as the
arbiter of international relations. Power politics
had outdone the League in its efforts to promote
peace, and the Locarno Pacts demonstrated
definitively that the major European powers
were not interested in handing authority over
to the League.
<br>
<br>
Similarly, the League repeatedly failed and
was outdone by traditional power politics in its
efforts to promote disarmament. The Washington
Conference and the subsequent London Naval
Conference of 1930 produced the only successful
armaments agreements of the inter-war years.
They were important steps toward disarmament,
but served to frustrate Japan, whose leaders felt
the nation was disrespected by the European
nations, and repudiated the agreements during
the late 1930s in preparation for World War
Two. One fact that emerged clearly from the
two conferences was that the United States,
though it generally stayed out of European
affairs during this era, lent great prestige to any
affair in which it involved itself, and as an
organizing unit commanded far more respect
from the economically and politically distressed
states of Europe than did the League of Nations,
which was in effect, a weak coalition of these
distressed states.
<br>
<br>
One reason that disarmament remained a
nearly impossible goal for the League of Nations
was its inability to persuade Britain and France
to cooperate and act against their respective
national interests. Britain was willing to support
the vast reduction of land forces to a minimal
level. However, France feared a German invasion
on its borders and refused to accept any
reduction in ground troops. France had no
qualms about supporting drastic naval cuts, but
Britain, an island nation, depended upon the
navy for security, and refused to decrease naval
strength. No arms agreement could be achieved
while these powers refused to compromise. It
took power politics and the presence of the
United States to forge the little compromise that
was reached.
<br>
<br>
The Kellogg-Briand Pact was important
not because of any practical application, but
because it successfully articulated the hatred
and fear of war that had developed in Europe
as a result of World War One. The Soviet Union,
not to be outdone, quickly adopted its own
Eastern peace treaty, the Livitinov Protocol,
which was signed by the Soviet Union and four
other states. The concept of rival peace treaties
conveys the contradictions and absurdity of
inter-war politics.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Economics During the Inter-War Years (1919-
1938)</i></strong></div>

During World War I, some 10 million
Europeans were killed, about 7 million were
permanently disabled, and 15 million seriously
wounded, mostly young men of working age
and middle class backgrounds. This loss,
combined with the destruction of land and
property, led to a European situation of grave
pessimism and poverty for many. Living
conditions declined dramatically at the close of
the war, the infant mortality rate skyrocketed,
and life was quite difficult for Europeans of the
period. The widespread material destruction
totaled billions of dollars of damage in Europe.
The war's prosecution had cost the nations of
Europe six and one-half times as much as the
total national debt of the entire world during
the years from 1800 to 1914.
<br>
<br>
The Allies bore the brunt of the debt, and
material damages, France especially. But the
Central Powers were punished severely by the
war's concluding treaties. Germany lost 15
percent of its pre-war capacity, all of its foreign
investments, and 90 percent of its mercantile
fleet. The Treaty of Versailles imposed
reparations payments which were generally
considered intolerable and impossible. In Austria,
agricultural production fell 53 percent from prewar levels, and starvation was a persistent
problem. Inflation hit all of Europe in the first
years after the war, as pent up demand was
released and production fell off due to a shortage
of raw materials. By 1920, prices in Hungary
were 23,000 times what they had been before
the war, and in Russia the multiplier was 4
million. A sharp depression in 1920 and 1921
corrected prices to some extent.
This depression, however, meant that the
debtor countries increasingly found it impossible
to pay their war debts. Germany pleaded with
Britain and France for a moratorium on
reparations payments, but France would not
agree, and in fact, sent troops into the Ruhr in
1923, when Germany defaulted on its payments.
In 1924, a solution was presented in the form
of the Dawes Plan, presented by the American,
Charles Dawes. Under this plan the total sum
owed by Germany would remain the same, but
the yearly payments were reduced, and Germany
was granted a loan. The German Chamber of
Deputies accepted the plan on August 27, 1924.
As a result, the German mark began to stabilize,
and Germany was able to pay on time for a
short while.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, the European Allies had their
own financial problems. They ended the war
deeply indebted to the United States. The United
States demanded payment in gold and dollars,
which the Allies borrowed from creditor nations,
creating even greater debt elsewhere.
From 1925 to 1929, Europe entered a period
of relative prosperity and stability. However,
unemployment remained high, and population
growth outstripped economic growth. During
this time, world trade increased and speculative
investment increased as the result of better
economic times. US creditors, flush with capital
coming in from Europe, led this speculative
movement.
<br>
<br>
Germany continued to struggle with
reparations payments, and in 1930, the Young
Plan replaced the Dawes Plan, lowering annual
payments yet again, but to no avail. In attempts
to maintain benefits for the unemployed and
drive prices down, taxes were hiked, and
unemployment shot up again. As the Great
Depression that had struck the United States in
1929 began to set in throughout Europe in the
early 30s, banks began to collapse. Despite
international loans, Germany, and Europe as a
whole, plunged into depression, during which
currencies collapsed and all hope of stability
was dashed. Despite efforts to stabilize world
prices and European employment, Europe
remained mired in depression until the outbreak
of World War II.
<br>
<br>
Most of the financial costs incurred by that
nations fighting in WWI were covered by deficit
spending. As a result, the money supply
increased without any regard to the actual gold
and silver reserves of the European nations.
Most nations were forced to abandon the gold
standard, causing their currencies to depreciate
rapidly and creating rampant inflation.
However, many analysts argue that strict
government policies, implemented at the correct
times, could have kept this inflation in check.
Regardless, these measures were not taken,
currencies remained wildly unstable, and world
trade could not be resumed. The widespread
borrowing of money to make debt payments
only served to worsen the situation. Reliance on
short-term loans at high rates, and the foolish
extension of credit to the struggling powers by
speculating creditor nations only served to drive
up national debts even farther, and generally
overextend the nations of Europe financially.
Germany was no exception to this rule.
Most of the money paid by Germany to Britain
and France under the Dawes Plan came in the
form of borrowed money. Between 1924 and
1929, Germany borrowed 28 billion marks, and
paid some 10 million in reparations. Even
without a depression in the early 1930s, this
situation was likely to collapse on the Germans'
heads. When the depression did hit, it was
magnified in Germany by this overwhelming
dependence on short-term capital.
<br>
<br>
While Europe struggled to rebuild during
the 1920s, the United States prospered as the
major creditor of the Allied nations. The United
States feared the depreciation and collapse of
foreign currencies, so demanded payment in
dollars and gold, a situation which put a great
deal of pressure on European treasuries.
However, US financial institutions benefited
greatly from this influx of capital, and sought
ways in which to invest it, driving up the US
stock market by speculation, and often sending
capital back to Europe in the form of loans.
American financial experts favored massive
international loans as a means of increasing
American exports, increasing employment,
and strengthening the already mighty dollar.
American enthusiasm for speculation raised
the economic tide both at home and in Europe
from 1925 to 1929, but in the end, the situation
proved unsustainable.
<br>
<br>
This period of outward prosperity belied
the problems beneath. There was no
international agreement on currency
stabilization, so it was carried out haphazardly, in a varied, unsynchronized fashion by
the nations of Europe. Currencies responded
to speculation during the period of prosperity,
rather than to realistic economic indicators.
Additionally, the prosperity achieved during
the late 1920s was distributed unevenly
throughout Europe. All of this meant that the
situation was primed for a sharp correction.
That correction came in the early 1930s,
plunging Europe into economic hard times once again.
