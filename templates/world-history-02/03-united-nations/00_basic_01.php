<h3>United Nations</h3>


History and development
Despite the problems encountered by the
League of Nations in arbitrating conflict and
ensuring international peace and security prior
to World War II, the major Allied powers
agreed during the war to establish a new global
organization to help manage international
affairs. This agreement was first articulated
when U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and
British Prime Minister Winston Churchill signed
the Atlantic Charter in August 1941. The name
United Nations was originally used to denote
the countries allied against Germany, Italy, and
Japan. On January 1, 1942, 26 countries signed
the Declaration by United Nations, which set
forth the war aims of the Allied powers.
The United States, the United Kingdom,
and the Soviet Union took the lead in designing
the new organization and determining its
decision-making structure and functions.
Initially, the "Big Three" states and their
respective leaders (Roosevelt, Churchill, and
Soviet premier Joseph Stalin) were hindered by
disagreements on issues that foreshadowed the
Cold War. The Soviet Union demanded
individual membership and voting rights for its
constituent republics, and Britain wanted
assurances that its colonies would not be placed
under UN control. There also was disagreement
over the voting system to be adopted in the
Security Council, an issue that became famous
as the "veto problem."
The first major step toward the formation
of the United Nations was taken August 21-
October 7, 1944, at the Dumbarton Oaks
Conference, a meeting of the diplomatic experts
of the Big Three powers plus China (a group
often designated the "Big Four") held at
Dumbarton Oaks, an estate in Washington,
D.C. Although the four countries agreed on the
general purpose, structure, and function of a
new world organization, the conference ended
amid continuing disagreement over membership
and voting. At the Yalta Conference, a meeting
of the Big Three in a Crimean resort city in
February 1945, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin
laid the basis for charter provisions delimiting
the authority of the Security Council. Moreover,
they reached a tentative accord on the number
of Soviet republics to be granted independent
memberships in the UN. Finally, the three leaders
agreed that the new organization would include
a trusteeship system to succeed the League of
Nations mandate system.
The Dumbarton Oaks proposals, with
modifications from the Yalta Conference, formed
the basis of negotiations at the United Nations
Conference on International Organization
(UNCIO), which convened in San Francisco on
April 25, 1945, and produced the final Charter
of the United Nations. The San Francisco
conference was attended by representatives of
50 countries from all geographic areas of the
world: 9 from Europe, 21 from the Americas, 7
from the Middle East, 2 from East Asia including
India, and 3 from Africa, as well as 1 each from
the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the
Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (in addition
to the Soviet Union itself) and 5 from British
Common wealth countries. Poland, which was
not present at the conference, was permitted to
become an original member of the UN. Security
Council veto power (among the permanent
members) was affirmed, though any member of
the General Assembly was able to raise issues
for discussion. Other political issues resolved by
compromise were the role of the organization in
the promotion of economic and social welfare;
the status of colonial areas and the distribution
of trusteeships; the status of regional and defense
arrangements; and Great Power dominance
versus the equality of states. The UN Charter


was unanimously adopted and signed on June
26 and promulgated on October 24, 1945.
Organization and administration
Principles and membership
The purposes, principles, and organization
of the United Nations are outlined in the Charter.
The essential principles underlying the purposes
and functions of the organization are listed in
Article 2 and include the following: the UN is
based on the sovereign equality of its members;
disputes are to be settled by peaceful means;
members are to refrain from the threat or use
of force in contravention of the purposes of the
UN; each member must assist the organization
in any enforcement actions it takes under the
Charter; and states that are not members of the
organization are required to act in accordance
with these principles insofar as it is necessary to
maintain international peace and security.
Article 2 also stipulates a basic long-standing
norm that the organization shall not intervene
in matters considered within the domestic
jurisdiction of any state. Although this was a
major limitation on UN action, over time the
line between international and domestic
jurisdiction has become blurred.
New members are admitted to the UN on
the recommendation of the Security Council
and by a two-thirds vote of the General Assembly.
Often, however, the admittance of new members
has engendered controversy. Given Cold War
divisions between East and West, the
requirement that the Security Council's five
permanent members (sometimes known
collectively as the P-5)-China, France, the Soviet
Union (whose seat and membership were
assumed by Russia in 1991), the United
Kingdom, and the United States-concur on the
admission of new members at times posed
serious obstacles. By 1950 only 9 of 31 applicants
had been admitted to the organization. In 1955
the 10th Assembly proposed a package deal
that, after modification by the Security Council,
resulted in the admission of 16 new states (4
eastern European communist states and 12
noncommunist countries). The most contentious
application for membership was that of the
communist People's Republic of China, which
was placed before the General Assembly and
blocked by the United States at every session
from 1950 to 1971. Finally, in 1971, in an effort
to improve its relationship with mainland China,
the United States refrained from blocking the
Assembly's vote to admit the People's Republic
and to expel the Republic of China (Taiwan);
there were 76 votes in favour of expulsion, 35
votes opposed, and 17 abstentions. As a result,
the Republic of China's membership and
permanent Security Council seat were given to
the People's Republic.
Controversy also arose over the issue of
"divided" states, including the Federal Republic
of Germany (West Germany) and the German
Democratic Republic (East Germany), North
and South Korea, and North and South Vietnam.
The two German states were admitted as
members in 1973; these two seats were reduced
to one after the country's reunification in October
1990. Vietnam was admitted in 1977, after the
defeat of South Vietnam and the reunification
of the country in 1975. The two Koreas were
admitted separately in 1991.
Following worldwide decolonization from
1955 to 1960, 40 new members were admitted,
and by the end of the 1970s there were about
150 members of the UN. Another significant
increase occurred after 1989-90, when many
former Soviet republics gained their
independence. By the early 21st century the UN
comprised nearly 190 member states.
Principal organs
The United Nations has six principal organs:
the General Assembly, the Security Council, the
Economic and Social Council, the Trusteeship
Council, the International Court of Justice, and
the Secretariat.
GENERAL ASSEMBLY
The only body in which all UN members
are represented, the General Assembly exercises
deliberative, supervisory, financial, and elective
functions relating to any matter within the
scope of the UN Charter. Its primary role,
however, is to discuss issues and make
recommendations, though it has no power to
enforce its resolutions or to compel state action.
Other functions include admitting new members;
selecting members of the Economic and Social
Council, the nonpermanent members of the
Security Council, and the Trusteeship Council;
supervising the activities of the other UN organs,
from which the Assembly receives reports; and
participating in the election of judges to the
International Court of Justice and the selection
of the secretary-general. Decisions usually are
reached by a simple majority vote. On important
questions, however-such as the admission of
new members, budgetary matters, and peace
and security issues-a two-thirds majority is
required.
<br>
<br>
The Assembly convenes annually and in
special sessions, electing a new president each
year from among five regional groups of states.
At the beginning of each regular session, the
Assembly also holds a general debate, in which
all members may participate and raise any issue
of international concern. Most work, however,
is delegated to six main committees: (1) Disarmament and International Security, (2) Economic and Financial, (3) Social, Humanitarian,
and Cultural, (4) Special Political and Decolonization, (5) Administrative and Budgetary,
and (6) Legal.
<br>
<br>
The General Assembly has debated issues
that other organs of the UN have either
overlooked or avoided, including decolonization,
the independence of Namibia, apartheid in
South Africa,terrorism, and the AIDS epidemic.
The number of resolutions passed by the
Assembly each year has climbed to more than
350, and many resolutions are adopted without
opposition. Nevertheless, there have been sharp
disagreements among members on several issues,
such as those relating to the Cold War, the
Arab-Israeli conflict, and human rights. The
General Assembly has drawn public attention
to major issues, thereby forcing member
governments to develop positions on them, and
it has helped to organize ad hoc bodies and
conferences to deal with important global
problems.
<br>
<br>
The large size of the Assembly and the
diversity of the issues it discusses contributed to
the emergence of regionally based voting blocs
in the 1960s. During the Cold War the Soviet
Union and the countries of eastern Europe
formed one of the most cohesive blocs, and
another bloc comprised the United States and
its Western allies. The admission of new countries
of the Southern Hemisphere in the 1960s and
'70s and the dissipation of Cold War tensions
after 1989 contributed to the formation of blocs
based on "North-South" economic issues-i.e.,
issues of disagreement between the more
prosperous, industrialized countries of the
Northern Hemisphere and the poorer, less
industrialized developing countries of the
Southern Hemisphere. Other issues have been
incorporated into the North-South divide,
including Northern economic and political
domination, economic development, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and support for
Israel.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SECURITY COUNCIL</i></strong></div>

The UN Charter assigns to the Security
Council primary responsibility for the
maintenance of international peace and security.
The Security Council originally consisted of 11
members-five permanent and six nonpermanentelected by the General Assembly for two-year
terms. From the beginning, nonpermanent
members of the Security Council were elected to
give representation to certain regions or groups
of states. As membership increased, however,
this practice ran into difficulty. An amendment
to the UN Charter in 1965 increased the council's
membership to 15, including the original five
permanent members plus 10 nonpermanent
members. Among the permanent members, the
People's Republic of China replaced the Republic
of China (Taiwan) in 1971, and the Russian
Federation succeeded the Soviet Union in 1991.
After the unification of Germany, debate over
the council's composition again arose, and
Germany, India, and Japan each applied for
permanent council seat.
<br>
<br>
The nonpermanent members are chosen to
achieve equitable regional representation, five
members coming from Africa or Asia, one from
eastern Europe, two from Latin America, and
two from western Europe or other areas. Five
of the 10 nonpermanent members are elected
each year by the General Assembly for two-year
terms, and five retire each year. The presidency
is held by each member in rotation for a period
of one month.
Each Security Council member is entitled
to one vote. On all "procedural" matters-the
definition of which is sometimes in disputedecisions by the council are made by an
affirmative vote of any nine of its members.
Substantive matters, such as the investigation of
a dispute or the application of sanctions, also
require nine affirmative votes, including those
of the five permanent members holding veto
power. In practice, however, a permanent
member may abstain without impairing the
validity of the decision. A vote on whether a
matter is procedural or substantive is itself a
substantive question. Because the Security
Council is required to function continuously,
each member is represented at all times at the
UN's headquarters in New York City.
Any country-even if it is not a member of
the UN-may bring a dispute to which it is a
party to the attention of the Security Council.
When there is a complaint, the council first
explores the possibility of a peaceful resolution.
International peacekeeping forces may be
authorized to keep warring parties apart pending
further negotiations. If the council finds that
there is a real threat to the peace, a breach of
the peace, or an act of aggression (as defined by
Article 39 of the UN Charter), it may call upon
UN members to apply diplomatic or economic
sanctions. If these methods prove inadequate,
the UN Charter allows the Security Council to
take military action against the offending
country.
<br>
<br>
During the Cold War, continual disagreement between the United States and the Soviet
Union coupled with the veto power of the
Security Council's permanent members made
the Security Council an ineffective institution.
Since the late 1980s, however, the council's
power and prestige have grown. Between 1987
and 2000 it authorized more peacekeeping
operations than at any previous time. The use
of the veto has declined dramatically, though
disagreements among permanent members of
the Security Council-most notably in 2003 over
the use of military force against Iraq-have
occasionally undermined the council's
effectiveness. To achieve consensus, comparatively informal meetings are held in private
among the council's permanent members, a
practice that has been criticized by nonpermanent members of the Security Council.
In addition to several standing and ad hoc
committees, the work of the council is facilitated
by the Military Staff Committee, sanctions
committees for each of the countries under
sanctions, peacekeeping forces committees, and
an International Tribunals Committee.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL</i></strong></div>

Designed to be the UN's main venue for the
discussion of international economic and social
issues, the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC) directs and coordinates the economic,
social, humanitarian, and cultural activities of
the UN and its specialized agencies. Established
by the UN Charter, ECOSOC is empowered to
recommend international action on economic
and social issues; promote universal respect for
human rights; and work for global cooperation
on health, education, and cultural and related
areas. ECOSOC conducts studies; formulates
resolutions, recommendations, and conventions
for consideration by the General Assembly; and
coordinates the activities of various UN programs
and specialized agencies. Most of ECOSOC's
work is performed in functional commissions on
topics such as human rights, narcotics,
population, social development, statistics, the
status of women, and science and technology;
the council also oversees regional commissions
for Europe, Asia and the Pacific, Western Asia,
Latin America, and Africa.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>TRUSTEESHIP COUNCIL</i></strong></div>

The Trusteeship Council was designed to
supervise the government of trust territories and
to lead them to self-government or independence. The trusteeship system, like the mandate
system under the League of Nations, was
established on the premise that colonial territories
taken from countries defeated in war should not
be annexed by the victorious powers but should
be administered by a trust country under
international supervision until their future status
was determined. Unlike the mandate system,
the trusteeship system invited petitions from
trust territories on their independence and
required periodic international missions to the
territories. In 1945 only 12 League of Nations
mandates remained: Nauru, New Guinea,
Ruanda-Urundi, Togoland and Cameroon
(French administered), Togoland and Cameroon
(British administered), the Pacific Islands
(Carolines, Marshalls, and Marianas), Western
Samoa, South West Africa, Tanganyika, and
Palestine. All these mandates became trust
territories except South West Africa (now
Namibia), which South Africa refused to enter
into the trusteeship system.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE</i></strong></div>

The International Court of Justice,
commonly known as the World Court, is the
principal judicial organ of the United Nations,
though the court's origins predate the League of
Nations. The idea for the creation of an
international court to arbitrate international
disputes arose during an international conference
held at The Hague in 1899. This institution was
subsumed under the League of Nations in 1919
as the Permanent Court of International Justice
(PCIJ) and adopted its present name with the
founding of the UN in 1945.
<br>
<br>
The court's decisions are binding, and its
broad jurisdiction encompasses "all cases which
the parties refer to it and all matters specially
provided for in the Charter of the United
Nations or in treaties and conventions in force."
Most importantly, states may not be parties to
a dispute without their consent, though they
may accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the
court in specified categories of disputes. The
court may give advisory opinions at the request
of the General Assembly or the Security Council
or at the request of other organs and specialized
agencies authorized by the General Assembly.
Although the court has successfully arbitrated
some cases (e.g., the border dispute between
Honduras and El Salvador in 1992), governments
have been reluctant to submit sensitive issues,
thereby limiting the court's ability to resolve
threats to international peace and security. At
times countries also have refused to acknowledge
the jurisdiction or the findings of the court. For
example, when Nicaragua sued the United
States in the court in 1984 for mining its
harbours, the court found in favour of Nicaragua,
but the United States refused to accept the
court's decision.
<br>
<br>
The 15 judges of the court are elected by
the General Assembly and the Security Council
voting independently. No two judges may be
nationals of the same state, and the judges are
to represent a cross section of the major legal
systems of the world. Judges serve nine-year
terms and are eligible for reelection. The seat of
the World Court is The Hague.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>SECRETARIAT</i></strong></div>

The secretary-general, the principal
administrative officer of the United Nations, is
elected for a five-year renewable term by a twothirds vote of the General Assembly and by the
recommendation of the Security Council and
the approval of its permanent members.
Secretaries-general usually have come from
small, neutral countries. The secretary-general
serves as the chief administrative officer at all
meetings and carries out any functions that
those organs entrust to the Secretariat; he also
oversees the preparation of the UN's budget.
The secretary-general has important political
functions, being charged with bringing before
the organization any matter that threatens
international peace and security. Both the chief
spokesperson for the UN and the UN's most
visible and authoritative figure in world affairs,
the secretary-general often serves as a high-level
negotiator. Attesting to the importance of the
post, two secretaries-general have been awarded
the Nobel Prize for Peace: Dag Hammarskjöld
in 1961 and Kofi Annan, co-recipient with the
UN, in 2001.
<br>
<br>
The Secretariat influences the work of the
United Nations to a much greater degree than
indicated in the UN Charter. It is responsible for
preparing numerous reports, studies, and
investigations, in addition to the major tasks of
translating, interpreting, providing services for
large numbers of meetings, and other work.
Under the Charter the staff is to be recruited
mainly on the basis of merit, though there has
been a conscious effort to recruit individuals
from different geographic regions. Some
members of the Secretariat are engaged on
permanent contracts, but others serve on
temporary assignment from their national
governments. In both cases they must take an
oath of loyalty to the United Nations and are
not permitted to receive instructions from
member governments. The influence of the
Secretariat can be attributed to the fact that the
some 9,000 people on its staff are permanent
experts and international civil servants rather
than political appointees of member states.
The Secretariat is based in New York,
Geneva, Vienna, Nairobi (Kenya), and other
locales. It has been criticized frequently for poor
administrative practices-though it has made
persistent efforts to increase the efficiency of its
operations-as well as for a lack of neutrality.
Functions


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Maintenance of international peace and
security</i></strong></div>

The main function of the United Nations is
to preserve international peace and security.
Chapter 6 of the Charter provides for the pacific
settlement of disputes, through the intervention
of the Security Council, by means such as
negotiation, mediation, arbitration, and judicial
decisions. The Security Council may investigate
any dispute or situation to determine whether
it is likely to endanger international peace and
security. At any stage of the dispute, the council
may recommend appropriate procedures or
methods of adjustment, and, if the parties fail
to settle the dispute by peaceful means, the
council may recommend terms of settlement.
The goal of collective security, whereby
aggression against one member is met with
resistance by all, underlies chapter 7 of the
Charter, which grants the Security Council the
power to order coercive measures-ranging from
diplomatic, economic, and military sanctions to
the use of armed force-in cases where attempts
at a peaceful settlement have failed. Such
measures were seldom applied during the Cold
War, however, because tensions between the
United States and the Soviet Union prevented
the Security Council from agreeing on the
instigators of aggression. Instead, actions to
maintain peace and security often took the form
of preventive diplomacy and peacekeeping. In
the post-Cold War period, appeals to the UN for
peacekeeping and related activities increased
dramatically, and new threats to international
peace and security were confronted, including
AIDS and international terrorism.
<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding the primary role of the
Security Council, the UN Charter provides for
the participation of the General Assembly and
nonmember states in security issues. Any state,
whether a member of the UN or not, may bring
any dispute or situation that endangers
international peace and security to the attention
of the Security Council or the General Assembly.
The Charter authorizes the General Assembly to
"discuss any questions relating to the
maintenance of international peace and security"
and to "make recommendations with regard to
any such questions to the state or states concerned
or to the Security Council or to both." This
authorization is restricted by the provision that,
"while the Security Council is exercising in
respect of any dispute or situation the functions
assigned to it in the present Charter, the General
Assembly shall not make any recommendation
with regard to that dispute or situation unless
the Security Council so requests." By the "Uniting
for Peace" resolution of November 1950, however,
the General Assembly granted to itself the power
to deal with threats to the peace if the Security
Council fails to act after a veto by a permanent
member. Although these provisions grant the
General Assembly a broad secondary role, the
Security Council can make decisions that bind
all members, whereas the General Assembly can
make only recommendations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Peacekeeping, peacemaking, and peace
building</i></strong></div>

International armed forces were first used
in 1948 to observe cease-fires in Kashmir and
Palestine. Although not specifically mentioned
in the UN Charter, the use of such forces as a
buffer between warring parties pending troop
withdrawals and negotiations-a practice known
as peacekeeping-was formalized in 1956 during
the Suez Crisis between Egypt, Israel, France,
and the United Kingdom. Peacekeeping missions
have taken many forms, though they have in
common the fact that they are designed to be
peaceful, that they involve military troops from
several countries, and that the troops serve
under the authority of the UN Security Council.
In 1988 the UN Peacekeeping Forces were
awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.
<br>
<br>
During the Cold War, so-called firstgeneration, or "classic," peacekeeping was used
in conflicts in the Middle East and Africa and
in conflicts stemming from decolonization in
Asia. Between 1948 and 1988 the UN undertook
13 peacekeeping missions involving generally
lightly armed troops from neutral countries
other than the permanent members of the
Security Council-most often Canada, Sweden,
Norway, Finland, India, Ireland, and Italy.
Troops in these missions, the so-called "Blue
Helmets," were allowed to use force only in selfdefense. The missions were given and enjoyed
the consent of the parties to the conflict and the
support of the Security Council and the troopcontributing countries.
With the end of the Cold War, the challenges
of peacekeeping became more complex. In order
to respond to situations in which internal order
had broken down and the civilian population
was suffering, "second-generation" peacekeeping
was developed to achieve multiple political and
social objectives. Unlike first-generation
peacekeeping, second-generation peacekeeping
often involves civilian experts and relief
specialists as well as soldiers. Another difference
between second-generation and first-generation
peacekeeping is that soldiers in some secondgeneration missions are authorized to employ
force for reasons other than self-defense. Because
the goals of second-generation peacekeeping
can be variable and difficult to define, however,
much controversy has accompanied the use of
troops in such missions.
<br>
<br>
In the 1990s, second-generation
peacekeeping missions were undertaken in
Cambodia (1991-93), the former Yugoslavia
(1992-95), Somalia (1992-95), and elsewhere
and included troops from the permanent
members of the Security Council as well as from
the developed and developing world (e.g.,
Australia, Pakistan, Ghana, Nigeria, Fiji, India).
In the former Yugoslav province of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, the Security Council created "safe
areas" to protect the predominantly Bosniak
(Bosnian Muslim) population from Serbian
attacks, and UN troops were authorized to
defend the areas with force. In each of these
cases, the UN reacted to threats to peace and
security within states, sometimes taking sides in
domestic disputes and thus jeopardizing its
own neutrality. Between 1988 and 2000 more
than 30 peacekeeping efforts were authorized,
and at their peak in 1993 more than 80,000
peacekeeping troops representing 77 countries
were deployed on missions throughout the
world. In the first years of the 21st century,
annual UN expenditures on peacekeeping
operations exceeded $2 billion.
In addition to traditional peacekeeping
and preventive diplomacy, in the post-Cold
War era the functions of UN forces were
expanded considerably to include peacemaking
and peace building. (Former UN secretarygeneral Boutros Boutros-Ghali described these
additional functions in his reports An Agenda
for Peace [1992] and Supplement to an Agenda
for Peace [1995]). For example, since 1990 UN
forces have supervised elections in many parts
of the world, including Nicaragua, Eritrea, and
Cambodia; encouraged peace negotiations in El
Salvador, Angola, and Western Sahara; and
distributed food in Somalia. The presence of UN
troops in Yugoslavia during the violent and
protracted disintegration of that country renewed
discussion about the role of UN troops in refugee
resettlement. In 1992 the UN created the
Department of Peacekeeping Operations
(DPKO), which provides administrative and
technical support for political and humanitarian
missions and coordinates all mine-clearing
activities conducted under UN auspices.
The UN's peacekeeping, peacemaking, and
peace-building activities have suffered from
serious logistical and financial difficulties. As
more missions are undertaken, the costs and
controversies associated with them have
multiplied dramatically. Although the UN
reimburses countries for the use of equipment,
these payments have been limited because of the
failure of many member states to pay their UN
dues.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Sanctions and military action</i></strong></div>

By subscribing to the Charter, all members
undertake to place at the disposal of the Security
Council armed forces and facilities for military
sanctions against aggressors or disturbers of the
peace. During the Cold War, however, no
agreements to give this measure effect were
concluded. Following the end of the Cold War,
the possibility of creating permanent UN forces
was revived.
<br>
<br>
During the Cold War the provisions of
chapter 7 of the UN Charter were invoked only
twice with the support of all five permanent
Security Council members-against Southern
Rhodesia in 1966 and against South Africa in
1977. After fighting broke out between North
and South Korea in June 1950, the United States
obtained a Security Council resolution
authorizing the use of force to support its ally,
South Korea, and turn back North Korean
forces. Because the Soviet Union was at the time
boycotting the Security Council over its refusal
to seat the People's Republic of China, there was
no veto of the U.S. measure. As a result, a U.S.-
led multinational force fought under the UN
banner until a cease-fire was reached on July 27,
1953.
<br>
<br>
The Security Council again voted to use
UN armed forces to repel an aggressor following
the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
After condemning the aggression and imposing
economic sanctions on Iraq, the council
authorized member states to use "all necessary
means" to restore "peace and security" to Kuwait.
The resulting Persian Gulf War lasted six weeks,
until Iraq agreed to comply with UN resolutions
and withdraw from Kuwait. The UN continued
to monitor Iraq's compliance with its resolutions,
which included the demand that Iraq eliminate
its weapons of mass destruction. In accordance
with this resolution, the Security Council
established a UN Special Mission (UNSCOM) to
inspect and verify Iraq's implementation of the
cease-fire terms. The United States, however,
continued to bomb Iraqi weapons installations
from time to time, citing Iraqi violations of "nofly" 
zones in the northern and southern regions
of the country, the targeting of U.S. military
aircraft by Iraqi radar, and the obstruction of
inspection efforts undertaken by UNSCOM.
The preponderant role of the United States
in initiating and commanding UN actions in
Korea in 1950 and the Persian Gulf in 1990-91
prompted debate over whether the requirements
and spirit of collective security could ever be
achieved apart from the interests of the most
powerful countries and without U.S. control.
The continued U.S. bombing of Iraq subsequent
to the Gulf War created further controversy
about whether the raids were justified under
previous UN Security Council resolutions and,
more generally, about whether the United States
was entitled to undertake military actions in the
name of collective security without the explicit
approval and cooperation of the UN. Meanwhile
some military personnel and members of the
U.S. Congress opposed the practice of allowing
U.S. troops to serve under UN command, arguing
that it amounted to an infringement of national
sovereignty. Still others in the United States and
western Europe urged a closer integration of
United States and allied command structures in
UN military operations.
<br>
<br>
In order to assess the UN's expanded role
in ensuring international peace and security
through dispute settlement, peacekeeping, peace
building, and enforcement action, a comprehensive review of UN Peace Operations was
undertaken. The resulting Brahimi Report
(formally the Report of the Panel on United
Nations Peace Operations), issued in 2000,
outlined the need for strengthening the UN's
capacity to undertake a wide variety of missions.
Among the many recommendations of the report
was that the UN maintain brigade-size forces of
5,000 troops that would be ready to deploy in
30 to 90 days and that UN headquarters be
staffed with trained military professionals able
to use advanced information technologies and
to plan operations with a UN team including
political, development, and human rights experts.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Arms control and disarmament</i></strong></div>

The UN's founders hoped that the
maintenance of international peace and security
would lead to the control and eventual reduction
of weapons. Therefore the Charter empowers
the General Assembly to consider principles for
arms control and disarmament and to make
recommendations to member states and the
Security Council. The Charter also gives the
Security Council the responsibility to formulate
plans for arms control and disarmament.
Although the goal of arms control and
disarmament has proved elusive, the UN has
facilitated the negotiation of several multilateral
arms control treaties.
<br>
<br>
Because of the enormous destructive power
realized with the development and use of the
atomic bomb during World War II, the General
Assembly in 1946 created the Atomic Energy
Commission to assist in the urgent consideration
of the control of atomic energy and in the
reduction of atomic weapons. The United States
promoted the Baruch Plan, which proposed the
elimination of existing stockpiles of atomic bombs
only after a system of international control was
established and prohibited veto power in the
Security Council on the commission's decisions.
The Soviet Union, proposing the Gromyko Plan,
wanted to ensure the destruction of stockpiles
before agreeing to an international supervisory
scheme and wanted to retain Security Council
veto power over the commission. The conflicting
positions of the two superpowers prevented
agreement on the international control of atomic
weapons and energy.
<br>
<br>
In 1947 the Security Council organized the
Commission for Conventional Armaments to
deal with armaments other than weapons of
mass destruction, but progress on this issue also
was blocked by disagreement between the Soviet
Union and the Western powers. As a result, in
1952 the General Assembly voted to replace
both of these commissions with a new
Disarmament Commission. Consisting of the
members of the Security Council and Canada,
this commission was directed to prepare
proposals that would regulate, limit, and balance
reduction of all armed forces and armaments;
eliminate all weapons of mass destruction; and
ensure international control and use of atomic
energy for peaceful purposes only. After five
years of vigorous effort and little progress, in
1957 the International Atomic Energy Agency
was established to promote the peaceful uses of
atomic energy.
<br>
<br>
In 1961 the General Assembly adopted a
resolution declaring the use of nuclear or
thermonuclear weapons to be contrary to
international law, to the UN Charter, and to the
laws of humanity. Two years later, on August
5, 1963, the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty was signed
by the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and
the United States. The treaty-to which more
than 150 states later adhered-prohibited nuclear
tests or explosions in the atmosphere, in outer
space, and underwater. In 1966 the General
Assembly unanimously approved a treaty
prohibiting the placement of weapons of mass
destruction in orbit, on the Moon, or on other
celestial bodies and recognizing the use of outer
spaceexclusively for peaceful purposes.
In June 1968 the Assembly approved the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons, which banned the spread of nuclear
weapons from nuclear to nonnuclear powers;
enjoined signatory nonnuclear powers, in
exchange for technical assistance in developing
nuclear power for "peaceful purposes," not to
develop or deploy nuclear weapons; and
committed the nuclear powers to engage in
measures of disarmament. The treaty represented
a significant commitment on the part of more
than 140 (now 185) signatory powers to control
nuclear weapons proliferation; nevertheless, for
many years the treaty, which went into effect
in 1970, was not ratified by significant nuclear
powers (including China and France) and many
"near-nuclear" states (including Argentina,
Brazil, Egypt, Israel, Pakistan, and South Africa).
Some of these states signed the treaty in the
early 1990s: South Africa signed in 1991,
followed by France and China in 1992.
The UN has been active in attempting to
eliminate other weapons of mass destruction of
a variety of types and in a variety of contexts.
In 1970 the General Assembly approved a treaty
banning the placement of weapons of mass
destruction on the seabed. A convention
prohibiting the manufacture, stockpiling, and
use of biological weapons was approved by the
Assembly in 1971 and took effect in 1975,
though many states have never acceded to it. In
1991 the UN General Assembly passed a
resolution on the registration of conventional
arms that required states to submit information
on major international arms transfers. During
the first several years of the registry, fewer than
half of the UN's members submitted the required
information; by 2000 about three-fifths of
governments filed annual reports. In 1993 the
Chemical Weapons Convention, which
prohibited the development, production,
stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons and
called for the destruction of existing stockpiles
within 10 years, was opened for signature. In
1996 the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban
Treaty, which prohibited the testing of nuclear
weapons, was signed-though it has not yet
entered into force-and two years later a treaty
banning the production and export of
antipersonnel land mines (Convention on the
Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production
and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on
Their Destruction) was concluded. Despite
international pressure, the United States refused
to sign both the test ban and the land mine
agreements.
<br>
<br>
Many negotiations on disarmament have
been held in Geneva. Negotiations have been
conducted by the Ten-Nation Committee on
Disarmament (1960); the Eighteen-Nation
Committee on Disarmament (1962-68); the
Conference of the Committee on Disarmament
(1969-78); and the Disarmament Commission
(1979- ), which now has more than 65
countries as members. Three special sessions
of the General Assembly have been organized
on disarmament, and, though the General
Assembly sessions have produced little in the
way of substantive agreements, they have
served to focus public attention on the issue.
In other forums, significant progress has been
made on limiting specific types of armaments,
such as bacteriologic, chemical, nuclear, and
toxic weapons.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Development of international law</i></strong></div>

The United Nations, like the League of
Nations, has played a major role in defining,
codifying, and expanding the realm of
international law. The International Law
Commission, established by the General
Assembly in 1947, is the primary institution
responsible for these activities. The Legal
Committee of the General Assembly receives the
commission's reports and debates its
recommendations; it may then either convene
an international conference to draw up formal
conventions based on the draft or merely
recommend the draft to states. The International
Court of Justice reinforces legal norms through
its judgments. The commission and the committee
have influenced international law in several
important domains, including the laws of war,
the law of the sea, human rights, and
international terrorism.
<br>
<br>
The work of the UN on developing and
codifying laws of war was built on the previous
accomplishments of the Hague Conventions
(1899-1907), the League of Nations, and the
Kellog-Briand Pact (1928). The organization's
first concern after World War II was the
punishment of suspected Nazi war criminals.
The General Assembly directed the International
Law Commission to formulate the principles of
international law recognized at the Nürnberg
trials, in which German war criminals were
prosecuted, and to prepare a draft code of
offenses against the peace and security of
mankind. In 1950 the commission submitted its
formulation of the Nürnberg principles, which
covered crimes against peace, war crimes, and
crimes against humanity. In the following year
the commission presented to the General
Assembly its draft articles, which enumerated
crimes against international law, including any
act or threat of aggression, annexation of
territory, and genocide. Although the General
Assembly did not adopt these reports, the
commission's work in formulating the Nürnberg
principles influenced the development of human
rights law.
<br>
<br>
The UN also took up the problem of defining
aggression, a task attempted unsuccessfully by
theLeague of Nations. Both the International
Law Commission and the General Assembly
undertook prolonged efforts that eventually
resulted in agreement in 1974. The definition of
aggression, which passed without dissent,
included launching military attacks, sending
armed mercenaries against another state, and
allowing one's territory to be used for
perpetrating an act of aggression against another
state. In 1987 the General Assembly adopted a
series of resolutions to strengthen legal norms in
favour of the peaceful resolution of disputes and
against the use of force.
The UN has made considerable progress in
developing and codifying the law of the sea as
well. The International Law Commission took
up the law of the sea as one of its earliest
concerns, and in 1958 and 1960, respectively,
the General Assembly convened the First and
the Second United Nations Conferences on the
Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The initial conference
approved conventions on the continental shelf,
fishing, the high seas, and territorial waters and
contiguous zones, all of which were ratified by
the mid-1960s. During the 1970s it came to be
accepted that the deep seabed is the "common
heritage of mankind" and should be administered
by an international authority. In 1973 the General
Assembly called UNCLOS III to discuss the
conflicting positions on this issue as well as on
issues relating to navigation, pollution, and the
breadth of territorial waters. The resulting Law
of the Sea Treaty (1982) has been ratified by
some 140 countries. The original treaty was not
signed by the United States, which objected to
the treaty's restrictions on seabed mining. The
United States signed a revised treaty after a
compromise was reached in 1994, though the
agreement has yet to be ratified by the U.S.
Senate.
<br>
<br>
The UN has worked to advance the law of
treaties and the laws regulating relations
between states. In 1989 the General Assembly
passed a resolution declaring 1990-99 the UN
Decade of International Law, to be dedicated to
promoting acceptance and respect for the
principles and institutions of international law.
In 1992 the General Assembly directed the
International Law Commission to prepare a
draft statute for an International Criminal Court.
The Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court (ICC) was adopted in July 1998 and later
signed by more than 120 countries. The ICC,
which is to be located at The Hague upon the
ratification of the statute by at least 60 signatory
countries, has jurisdiction over crimes against
humanity, crimes of genocide, war crimes, and
crimes of aggression, pending an acceptable
definition of that term. Under the terms of the
convention, no person age 18 years or older is
immune from prosecution, including presidents
or heads of state.
<br>
<br>
Since 1963 the United Nations has been
active in developing a legal framework for
combating international terrorism. The General
Assembly and specialized agencies such as the
International Civil Aviation Organization and
the International Atomic Energy Agency
established conventions on issues such as offenses
committed on aircraft, acts jeopardizing the
safety of civil aviation, the unlawful taking of
hostages, and the theft or illegal transfer of
nuclear weapons technology. In 2001, in the
wake of devastating terrorist attacks that killed
thousands in the United States, the General
Assembly's Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism
continued work on a comprehensive convention
for the suppression of terrorism.
