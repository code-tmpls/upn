<h3>Cold War</h3>


In the course of the nineteenth century, the
world effectively passed under the domination
of the six imperial powers, what were known
as the great powers, USA, Great Britain, France,
Germany, Russia, and Japan.
World War II resulted in the concentration
of leadership in just two powers, the super
powers, the USA and the USSR, with the UK,
France, Germany, and Japan reduced to second
rank. During the epoch of the Cold War, the
hierarchy appeared thus: the super powers
USA and USSR as leaders; a second level of a
vast body of states of unequal resources but
none capable of challenging the super powers;
and a number of aspirant states and entities,
although their number was dwindling through
decolonization, but sometimes increasing
through movements of secession within existing
states.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Russian Power</i></strong></div>

From the beginning of 1917 Russia
experienced a tremendous domestic political
and socio-economic upheaval with several
factions struggling to gain exclusive power. In
October-November 1917 the Bolsheviks led by
Vladimir Lenin replaced a coalition of socialists
in the Kremlin and immediately sued for peace
with Germany. The Bolshevik Revolution
affected every aspect of Russian life and also
had profound effects on the rest of the world,
most immediately in Europe and on international
relations.
<br>
<br>
Avowed Bolshevik aims of fostering world
revolution aroused acute anxiety in all capitalist
societies that lasted over the next seven decades.
The ideology of revolution and its accompanying
propaganda of workers rights across national
borders became an instrument of the Communist
Third International, which replaced the Second
International in 1920, as well as that of the
Soviet Union. At the same time, Lenin wanted
Russia to have normal relations - including
credits and trade - with the western powers.
Announcement of a New Economic Policy
(NEP) in 1921 enabled a commercial agreement
with Britain but de jure recognition was not
forthcoming from Britain, France or Italy until
1924 and from the US only in 1933. Stalin's
assumption of power in 1928 and the means he
adopted to ensure his supremacy and implement
his policies of economic transformation in the
1930s - were extreme by any definition, and
made the Soviet synonymous with 'totalitarianism' in the western lexicon.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Policy Of Containment</i></strong></div>

Origins of the Cold War lay in the Russian
Revolution of 1917 and the image of communism
as a militant faith determined to produce world
revolution.
<br>
<br>
US policies of 'containment' as well as
President Reagan's depiction of the Soviet Union
as an "evil empire" in the 1980s grew out of that
mindset.
The supreme power of the US in 1945 was
evident in its economy that accounted for about
50 per cent of total world GNP, its superiority,
and its technical prowess seen in the detonation
of two atomic bombs.
Defeated Germany was divided into four
occupation zones, as was its capital Berlin
situated within the Soviet zone. The occupying
powers differed on many subjects including deNazification, reparations, the German-Polish
border, currency and economic policies, and
transit rights.
<br>
<br>
Mutually reinforcing fear and suspicion
could be seen on the one hand, in Soviet
convictions that the US intended to renege on
promises made at Yalta and use a rearmed
Germany against the USSR, and on the other
hand, in American convictions that the Soviet
Union intended to control all of Germany and
advance into as much of Europe and the rest of
the world as possible. To forestall such an
eventually through a policy of 'containment' of
communism became the prime foreign policy
objective of the US.
<br>
<br>
In March 1947 President Truman
announced a 'doctrine' for opposing communism. All Latin American countries committed
themselves to joint defense against internal and
external communist subversion in the Rio treaty
signed with the US in 1947. In June 1947
Secretary of State John Marshall launched a
plan of massive economic grants ($17 billion
between 1948 and 1952) to 16 non-communist
European countries conditional on their removing
barriers to economic integration.
<br>
<br>
<b>Cold War:</b> Manifestations
Confrontation between these two military
alliances armed with increasingly sophisticated
conventional and nuclear weapons was the
central feature of the Cold War. Though both
sides probably overestimated the aggressive
intentions of the other, fear of their capabilities
spurred an arms race and sharpened the sense
of danger of imminent nuclear conflict over
several decades, especially at times of crisis such
as over Berlin in 1948 and 1961, the Hungarian
nationalist uprising of 1956, the Taiwan Straits
in 1958, or the Cuban Missile crisis of 1962.
Gradually, however, nuclear weapons came
to be seen as non-usable and territorial status
quo in Europe was accepted by both sides, even
when challenged by internal events such as the
'Prague Spring' of 1968. A European détente
was initiated and in 1975 all the European
states along with Canada, the US, and the
USSR came together in the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE)
affirming the status quo as well the need to
protect human rights.
<br>
<br>
The Cold War came to Asia first when the
proclamation of the Peoples Republic of China
(PRC) in October 1949 was interpreted as a
grievous 'loss' in the US.
In June 1950 the partitioned peninsular
nation of Korea erupted in war and the US led
United Nations forces against communist North
Korea forces assisted by PRC 'volunteers'. The
Korean War ended in a stalemate and an armed
armistice in 1953 that created a demilitarized
zone along the 38th parallel. Communist North
Korea, in alliance with neighbouring PRC,
seemed to freeze in time even as substantial US
forces were stationed in South Korea and remain
there.
<br>
<br>
The Eisenhower Administration in the US
deployed its Seventh Fleet to neutralize the
Taiwan Straits and prevent open conflict between
the PRC and ROC. The US also announced a
doctrine of 'massive retaliation' -that is, possible
use of nuclear weapons -to deter communist
expansion, supported the French in Vietnam
against nationalist forces led by communist
leader Ho Chi Minh.
A defence pact setting up the South East
Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) was signed
on 8 September 1954 by the US, Australia,
Britain, France, New Zealand, Pakistan, the
Philippines, and Thailand.
Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO) was
established by the US with Britain, Iran, Iraq
(withdrew in 1958), Pakistan and Turkey in
order to knit together the countries bordering
the vulnerable southern border of the USSR.
The Soviet Union and PRC did not attempt to
replicate the Warsaw Pact in Asia but each
stepped across the Western line of containment
by conducting an active diplomacy of political
support, trade, economic assistance, and arms
supplies with various neighbouring and/or
nonaligned states such as Afghanistan, Burma,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria,
and North Vietnam.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cuban Missile Crisis</i></strong></div>

The most dangerous crisis of the Cold War
took place in October 1962 over the issue of
Soviet missiles placed in the Caribbean island of
Cuba. There a popular revolution led by Fidel
Castro had displaced the military regime of
Fulgencio Batista in January 1959 and US backed
attempts by Cuban émigrés to overthrow Castro
had failed.
<br>
<br>
The Soviet post-Stalin leader Nikita
Khrushchev decided to protect Cuba against
American invasion by positioning nuclear
missiles in Cuba. The US President John F.
Kennedy reacted in anger to their discovery by
a reconnaissance aircraft on 10 October 1962,
demanding removal of the missile bases and
ordering a naval blockade of Cuba on 18 October.
No other episode of the Cold War has
received such microscopic scrutiny from
historians and re-enactments by prominent
participants of the time, partly because every
facet of American-Soviet competition intersected
in it: conflicting ideologies, the nuclear arms
race, relations with allies and newly independent
states, domestic political linkages with foreign
policy, public and private diplomacy exemplified
in United Nations leaders, neither of whom
could afford to publically step down.
By mid-November the crisis was over. Soviet
missiles were withdrawn from Cuba and some
months later American Jupiter missiles were
withdrawn from Turkey; Castro remained in
power and threats of open invasion were ruled
out; Kennedy won a victory with dignity and
without war; the Soviet Union was not
humiliated. Most importantly, both sides were
shocked by realization of their own vulnerability
and moved towards avoiding direct
confrontation in areas of peripheral interest and
framing rules for conducting the nuclear arms
race such as the Partial Test Ban Treaty of 1963
and the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty of
1972.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Report of Sarkaria Commission</i></strong></div>
Vietnam War
American involvement in the Vietnam War
began in support of an anti-Communist but
weak South Vietnam facing insurgency backed
by communist North Vietnam in the early 1960s.
A central security premise of US policy in Asia
at the time was 'domino theory' that the toppling
of one non-communist government inevitably
would lead to successive falls and expanding
communism.
<br>
<br>
A major US bombing campaign from the
air in the mid and late 1960s was accompanied
by the introduction of larger number of
American combat troops on the ground, where
they were bogged down in a quagmire of
guerilla warfare, and an enlargement of the war
zone into Cambodia and Laos. Vocal opposition
to the Vietnam War within the US and its allies,
as well as strategic considerations about détente
with the Soviet Union, led US President Nixon
to make a dramatic rapproachment with China
in 1971-72 and extract American troops from
Vietnam in 1973.
A reunification of Vietnam by the
communist North followed soon after in 1975.
The US underwent considerable self-questioning
and loss of confidence in the mid-1970s and
earlier bipartisan consensus on national security
policies was fractured.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cold War in Third World</i></strong></div>

Some events in Third World, such as the
assertiveness of the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) in 1973 and after,
the growth of the Non Aligned Movement,
conflict within the former Portuguese colonies
in Africa, and the Islamic Revolution in Iran of
1979, militated against Western interests for the
US led block . These events occurred without
direct Soviet participation but, Soviets also
intervened in some other areas of world. The
Soviet Union used the 'Brezhnev Doctrine' to
justify military intervention to protect a
communist (or leftist) government outside its
own borders-as in Czechoslovakia in 1979.
American reactions, and the election of
Republican Ronald Reagan as president in 1980,
ushered in a 'New Cold War' of proxy conflict
fought by government forces and Islamicist
Mujahedin in Afghanistan, in Nicaragua
between Sandinista government forces and rightwing 'contras', and in EI Salvador and other
Central American countries between right-wing
governments and left-wing guerilla fighters.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Nuclear Arm Race</i></strong></div>

An integral part of the Cold War was the
nuclear arms race, primarily between the US
and the USSR. In 1942, after the US had entered
World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt
authorized the Manhatten Project, a costly
programme with several locations and many
scientists and engineers, to build nuclear
reactors and fabricate an atomic weapon as
soon as possible and before Germany could do
so. Project Y headed by Robert Oppenheimer
at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory, New
Mexico, successfully tested one such device at
Alamogordo on 16 July 1945 when he saw "a
thousand suns".
<br>
<br>
The USSR tested its first atomic weapon
on 26 August 1949.
US did not long retain its nuclear
monopoly, and after the Soviet Union, others
too tested and produced their own nuclear
weapons: Britain in 1952, France in 1959,
China in 1964, Israel probably and in secret in
1968, India in 1973 though it did not weaponize
until after 1998, and Pakistan in 1998 or
possibly in 1987. Iraq, Iran and North Korea
also have been widely suspected of having
nuclear weapons ambitions and possible
capability.
<br>
<br>
Neither superpower explicity ruled out
use of nuclear weapons-indeed their status as
superpowers as well as their respective doctrines
of national security rested heavily on their
possession and threatened use of nuclear
weapons - and the numbers of nuclear
warheads of different kinds they produced
multiplied exponentially to total over 60,000 at
the height of the Cold War. Even after both
had agreed to strategic arms limitations and
reductions in the 1980s and 1990s, their arsenals
remain formidable.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Arm Race</i></strong></div>

International hostility and conflicts over
spheres of influence suffice to begin and
maintain high levels of military spending,
domestic influences, American and Soviet
nuclear doctrines are some of the factors that
led to an arms race during the Cold War.
In the first decade of the Cold War the US
relied on its air and nuclear superiority to
counter Soviet conventional and ground
superiority in Europe and threatened 'massive
retaliation' against any attempted change in
the status quo. In the 1960s it relied on 'flexible
response' and the creation of an invulnerable
'second strike' capacity based on a triad of air,
land and sea based missiles aimed at a range
of targets including cities to 'deter' any possible
'first strike' by the Soviet Union.
In the 1970s the US aimed for stability in
the status quo through arms control
negotiations and détente. In the 1980s US
engaged in a military build-up that included
deployment of intermediate range missiles in
Europe to reassure Western Europe of American
commitment to its defence, and a new Strategic
Defence Initiative, what Reagan called 'Star
Wars'.
<br>
<br>
The New Cold War of the 1980s intensified
danger not only because of heightened conflict
in Asia, Africa, and Central America, but
because of the introduction of new and more
lethal nuclear weapons into superpower
arsenals and the deployment of some in Europe,
as well as Reagan's proposed Strategic Defence
Initiative (SDI) that threatened stability of the
1972 ABM Treaty by taking the arms race into
space.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>MAD and 'deterrence'</i></strong></div>

The theory of 'deterrence' -itself a term
capable of flexible interpretation but based on
the assumption of two roughly comparable
hostile powers with common conceptions of
what constituted 'rational action' -was central
to American strategic doctrine throughout. More
than deterrence by possession of nuclear
weapons, what kept the Cold War from
becoming hot was Mutual Assured Destruction
(MAD).
<br>
<br>
US and USSR moved toward arms control
measures beginning with the Partial Test Ban
Treaty (banning atmospheric tests) signed on 5
August 1963. Arms control negotiations were
extended exercises in bargaining and conflict
management, not efforts to bring about
disarmament or conflict resolution.
The major bilateral nuclear weapon treaties
signed by US and the USSR/Russia are as
follows:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>May 1972 Anti-Ballistic Treaty
Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty (SALT I)</li>
        <li>July 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty
June 1979 Strategic Arms Limitation
Treaty (SALT II)</li>
        <li>December 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces
Treaty</li>
        <li>July 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START I)</li>
        <li>January 1993 Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaty (START II)</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons</i></strong></div>

Measures were undertaken to prevent and
check that type of 'horizontal' proliferation,
notably the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons (NPT) negotiated over three
years and opened for signature by states on 1
July 1968 with an initial validity of 25 years.
With 135 initial and 187 current signatories, the
NPT is the largest multilateral treaty on record
and was indefinitely extended in 1995. The NPT
specifically defines a nuclear-weapon state
(NWS) as one that had manufactured and
exploded a nuclear device before 1 January
1967. (This definition is the main reason for
India being opposed to treaty).
Increasingly stringent limitations have been
placed on trade and transfers of any materials
or technologies that could be used for military
purposes by suppliers, groups such as the
Zangger Committee and the Nuclear Supplies
Group founded in the 1970s, the Missile
Technology Control Regime (MTCR) of 1987
and the Warsaw Guidelines of 1992. Domestic
legislation and vigorous surveillance in some
countries since the 1970s, notably in the US,
raise very high barriers to transfers of doubtful
materials and technologies, and "counter
proliferation" tactics devised to discourage
potential proliferators.
In September 1996 a Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT) was opened for signature
and negotiation for a multilateral treaty on a
cutoff of production of fissile material for nuclear
weapons was in process.
<br>
<br>
The CTBT required the 44 states, judged to
be nuclear capable to sign and ratify it before
coming into force; India objected to being
numbered one of the 44 and did not sign, and
though President Clinton signed in 1999 the US
Senate did not ratify the treaty. India, and
Pakistan, openly tested nuclear weapons in
May 1998 and moved toward their deployment;
US pressures on them to "roll back" their
programmes failed.
At the heart of the proliferation dilemma,
however, is the issue of equity. The NPT created
a hierarchy of states, privileging the NWS on
condition that they sincerely move toward the
abolition of nuclear weapons. Their failure to do
so and their adoption of counter-proliferation
measures (including development of new types
of nuclear weapons) raised suspicions that they
wanted a perpetual freeze of hierarchy.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Disintegration Of USSR</i></strong></div>

Brezhnev was succeeded after his death in
1982, by men of his own generation, first by
Yuri Andropov, who died in February 1984,
and then by Konstantin Chenenko, who died in
March 1985. Neither had the time nor energy
to attempt internal reform or external initiatives.
Gorbachev simultaneously launched three
campaigns and conducted them personally.
One was externally directed to establish good
relations with world leaders, especially in the
West beginning with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, and to restructure relations
with other Socialist states on the basis of
independence rather than the Brezhnev Doctrine
of intervention. Gorbachev's state visit to
Washington D.C. in December 1987 was a
public relations triumph for him and the
beginning of a personal rapport with then VicePresident George Bush.
Another campaign was to promote the
idea of perestroika -meaning reform and an allembracing modernization so as to improve
economic performance and living conditions of
the people-among Soviet officials and the public
during his many tours around the country. And
a third campaign was also internal, to introduce
glasnost -meaning openness-in sharing
information with the frequently alienated
intelligentsia. Gorbachev's diplomacy assisted
by Foreign Minister Eduard Shevarnadze,
brought an end to the Cold War.
<br>
<br>
Power struggle between the US and USSR
played out by proxy on all continents but most
of all in the arms race. Gorbachev's economic
reforms moving the Soviet Union away from its
state controlled 'command' model toward a
mixed and even a market economy obviously
diminished ideological conflict, as did his public
advocacy of universal 'democratic' values.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Collapse Begins</i></strong></div>

Elections in Poland brought Solidarity to
power in place of the Communist Party. Hungary
embraced a multiparty system and opened its
border with Austria in May 1989. The regimes
in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, and later Romania
collapsed.
<br>
<br>
On the night of 8 November the crises came
to a head with huge crowds gathering at the
Berlin Wall and tearing parts of it down with
their hands; the checkpoints to West Berlin were
opened to allow for an exodus. The future of
Germany, in one or in two states, was a difficult
question to resolve. Gorbachev met FRG
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the first time in
October 1988 when they both agree in Moscow
to promote links between NATO and the
Warsaw Pact. Finally, skilful diplomacy resulted
in all accepting a re-united Germany within
NATO, at the same time renouncing forever
possession of WMDs and formally committed to
"good neighbourliness, partnership and
cooperation."
<br>
<br>
The Baltic Republics of Estonia, Latvia and
Lithuania exploded in resentment against
Russians, were tacitly helped in their drive for
independence by the US, which had always
refused to recognize them as part of the USSR.
Corruption in Uzbekistan led to an insurrection
there in 1986, followed by troubles in Kazakhstan
and throughout the Trans-Caucasian region
including Nagorno-Karabakh, Georgia, and later
Chechnya.
The Soviet Union was officially dissolved in
December 1991, replaced in name by the
Commonwealth of Independent States. Fourteen
new states became members of the United
Nations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Troubling 90s: 'humanitarian crises'</i></strong></div>

Yugoslavia, a conglomerate state created by
the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, had survived the
death of its unifying leader Josip Broz Tito in May
1980 but faced intensifying tensions between the
more and the less economically developed
republics and shrinking resources fueled animosity
among different ethnic and religious groups.
Croatia and Slovenia declared independence in
1991 and Slobodan Milosevic became leader of
a nationalistic Serbia determined to build a
'Greater Serbia' out of the remaining units of
multi-ethnic Yugoslavia at the cost of minority
groups, including the Muslims of Bosnia and the
Albanians of Kosovo.
<br>
<br>
Atrocities that came to be called 'ethnic
cleansing' led to military conflict, expressions of
international alarm, and an inadequate United
Nations intervention in Bosnia in 1991-92 that
was replaced by a NATO force in late 1995.
Neither of two (UN and NATO) could restore
peace or prevent massacres and population
transfers that resulted in an ethnically-partitioned
Bosnia reflected in the final Dayton peace
agreement. Further conflict flared in Kosovo and
US led-NATO forces conducted 11 weeks of air
strikes on Serbia and its capital on Serbia and its
capital Belgrade in 1999 before stationing peace
keeping troops in Kosovo. Yugoslavia suffered
from Western Europe's economic slow down and
unemployment in the 1980s.
<br>
<br>
The Bosnian horrors viewed on international
television were equaled or exceeded by
'humanitarian crises' in various parts of Africa,
particularly in Rwanda in 1994 when the Hutu
massacred the Tutsi people. The issue of protecting
human rights received increasing international
attention in the aftermath of the Cold War and
the Tiananmen Square event in China, with nongovernmental organizations playing important
roles in the effort.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bi-Polar to Uni-Polar World</i></strong></div>

Polarity is a descriptive term that illustrates
the structure of the system through a portrayal
of the concentration of hard power capabilities
in the system. The three main variations in
polarity are unipolarity, bipolarity and
multipolarity. However it is important to
recognise that even within each type of polarity
there exists variation. For example, John
Mearsheimer has distinguished between
balanced multipolarity and unbalanced
multipolarity.
<br>
<br>
Charles Krauthammer and Robert Kagan
are what might be called unipolar unilateralists.
They see the distribution of power in the
international system as essentially unipolar. They
also embrace unilateral policies as the means by
which the United States must protect its interests
and act for the greater good of humanity.
Nye acknowledge some elements of
multipolarity in the international system. He
argues that international relations has become
a three level game involving military, economic
and so-called soft power, with the US enjoying
unipolar dominance only on the first level. Any
unipolar imbalance can only be momentary, as
competing power centres inevitably rise and
seek to counterbalance the dominant power.
Mearsheimer also argues that US policy must be
unilateralist for the simple reason that all great
powers pursue essentially unilateral policies.
Unipolarity implies neither the absence of
all politics among great powers nor the absence
of all power balancing among lesser powers nor
certainly the resolution of all global problems. It
does not mechanistically determine a specific
strategy on the part of the major powers. It
simply creates incentives for strategies that
diminish if not eliminate two major problems
that bedeviled international systems of the past:
struggles for global primacy and competitive
balancing among the major powers.
<br>
<br>
Unipolarity is a necessary, but not sufficient
condition for the status of global hegemony.
Samuel Huntington has proposed that changes
in post-Cold War international politics reflects
a uni-multipolar system with one superpower
and several major powers. It has been argued
that the waning of 'American hegemony' has
given rise to the regional power centres of
Europe and East Asia. However, despite the
devolution of US power globally, the shift
towards multipolarity is several decades from
now.
<br>
<br>
For close to five decades the antagonism
between the United States and the erstwhile
Soviet Union determined the ebb and flows of
international power politics with their proxy
nations being witness to civil and military conflict,
especially in Asia and Africa. The consequences
of the Cold War, it can be premised, are still
visible in the changing international order.
In the absence of effective UN or EU action
the US took the lead in Bosnia and Kosovo. An
image of the US a 'hyper power', the
'indispensable power', gained currency in the
1990s when it was the only remaining superpower, but also triggered expressions of
preference by many world leaders for a multipolar international system.
In a widely cited essay Christopher Layne
argues that America's unipolar moment will be
short-lived, as smaller states will inevitably
balance against it, leading to a new multipolar
era. For neo-realists, unipolarity is the least
stable of all structures because any great
concentration of power threatens other states
and causes them to take action to restore a
balance. Other commentators suggest that a
large concentration of power works for peace,
and they doubt that US preponderance is fragile
and easily negated by the actions of other states.
The power of the US is not unlimited, but
it is unprecedented. The US accounts for 60 per
cent of all defence spending among the world's
major powers. It also accounts for 40 per cent
of economic production, 40 per cent of
technology production and 50 per cent of total
research and development expenditures.
Calleo and Kupchan see the European
Union (EU) as evolving into a great power
counterpart of the US, one that is neither weak
nor necessarily a threat to US interests. Calleo
sees a stronger EU as the natural partner of a
chastened and more modest US in building a
"cooperative multilateral system.
Balance-of-threat theory was advanced by
Stephan Walt. In this he points to the durability
of the 'unipolar movement'. Walt suggests that
the balancing behavior of states may be
overcome, provided that the foreign policy of
the dominant state is moderate and is seen by
other states as preferable to the rivalry of a
multipolar world. Similarly, Mastanduno
proposes that, "unipolarity will not be preserved
forever, but balance-of-threat theory implies
that it may be sustainable for a meaningfully
longer period than balance-of-power theorists
anticipate.
<br>
<br>
Coral Bell and Michael Mastanduno argue
that the durability of unipolarity rests on balanceof-threat theory. Balance-of-threat theory
proposes that states will not balance a dominant
powers if its behavior is perceived as benign and
non-threatening. Following this, a dominant
power is supported if it exercises its power to
promote shared interests and institutions that
subvert anarchy and competition. In contrast,
states that exercise unfettered power and engage
in predatory behavior are likely to trigger
balancing coalitions.
US officials have sought to preserve US
preponderance through efforts to convince
countries like Japan and Germany to remain
partial great powers, and to integrate potential
great powers like Russia and China into an
American led new world order.
<br>
<br>
Balance-of-power theory, developed most
explicitly by Kenneth waltz, argues that uni
polarity will be transformed into multi polarity
by the early decades of the twenty-first century.
In Walt'z analysis he draws on the historical
behavior of states to moderate assymetrics of
power among nations and to balance what he
terms "American hegemony."
The extent to which the international system
remains unipolar depends on the exercise of US
power. The US has sought to legitimise its
primacy in political-military matters through a
combination of 'benign hegemony' and
'multilateral rule-making' rather than forceful
unilateralism. To maintain its primacy in
international affairs, the US has followed the
prescriptions of balance-of-threat theory in
promoting limited American hegemony. But
recent adventurism and unilateral actions in
name of 'War On Terror' are indications that US
hegemony will be questioned and confronted by
rapid changes.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Future Ahead</i></strong></div>

World Power structure was altered for a
long time to come in 1991 with the end of the
Cold War when the Soviet Union acknowledged
defeat, disbanded itself, and passed on the
undisputed leadership of the world to the USA,
the sole super power, or hyper power now.
A great power system of colonial powers
was replaced by a superpower system of the
Cold War; this has now gone on to the hyper
power leadership and domination of the USA
in the post-Cold War era. This is a measure of
the integration of the world and of the
international system with it. The future is as
ever uncertain; but it is especially uncertain
because the leadership position of the USA
cannot be eternal.
<br>
<br>
It is not that warfare and devastation will
come to an end with the presence of the global
policeman in the form of the US hyper power.
But the nature of the wars will presumably
change to the more local or the more focused,
or both, and remain as destructive as they have
been during the Cold War; but the scale of
destruction may not be of the same order of
magnitude as in the World Wars. For example,
after the Cold War, the US has launched into
wars and campaigns against "Islamic
fundamentalism" and "terrorism", both of which
are global in their reach; but they are also more
pin-pointed than the World Wars.
Nobody can doubt that the 21st century
will be an Asian century. Rise of Asia is
concluded surmise of multiple streams that are
criss- crossing the whole world. Three biggest
contenders in the emerging power game are
China, Japan and India. An increasingly assertive
China, rising hard line politics in Russia,
