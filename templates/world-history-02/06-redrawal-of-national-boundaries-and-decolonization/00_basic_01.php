<h3>Redrawal of National Boundaries and Decolonization</h3>


The world has been completely transformed
during the years since the end of the Second
World War in 1945. Its political map has also
changed. The influence and the dominations
which a few European imperialist powers
exercised in the prewar years became things of
the past. A large number of nations in Asia and
Africa which had been suffering under colonial
rule emerged as independent nations. Together,
they have become a major factor in the world.
The United States had emerged as the biggest
power after the First World War. The Soviet
Union also emerged as a mighty power after the
Second World War, in spite of the terrible
devastation that she suffered during the war.
Before the Second World War, the Soviet Union
was the only country. In the world which
professed socialism. After the war, a number of
other countries joined her.
<br>
<br>
The two world wars, fought within a brief
period of about 30 years, resulted in the loss of
millions of human lives. The danger of a new
world war which would destroy human life
altogether created a new awareness of the need
for establishing lasting peace. Peoples and nations
made efforts in this direction by promoting
mutual relations based on friendship and
cooperation. They also created many new
institutions and agencies for the purpose.
However, in spite of these efforts the period
after the Second World War has been full of
stresses and strains. It has seen many conflicts
and wars in which hundreds of thousands of
people have been killed even though the world
has escaped a large-scale conflagration.
Since the late 1980s, further changes have
taken place m some parts of the world. Some of
the consequences of the Second World War and,
in some cases, even of the First World War have
been undone during the past five years. During
this period, some of the issues which dominated
the world and some of the forces and factors
which shaped the world for about four decades
after the war have become irrelevant. The ‘threat
of communism’ which had been a major factor
in determining the policies of many countries
since the Russian Revolution and, even more so,
after the Second World War is no longer an
issue. Communist regimes in the Soviet Union
and in the countries of Eastern Europe have
collapsed. The Soviet Union has broken up into
15 independent States. Many other changes
have taken place the world over and it is
possible to think of the period from the late 1980
as the one marking the beginning of a new
phase in the history of the world after the
Second World War.
<br>
<br>
During the war, the major Allied nations
had held many conferences and had issued
declarations stating the principles which would
form the bases of peace. The first major
declaration had been issued by Britain and USA
in 1941. It stated that Britain and the United
States would not seek any territory. It also
supported the right of every people to have the
form of government of their choice. Early in
1942 was issued, as mentioned before, the
United Nations Declaration. This Declaration
supported the one issued by Britain and USA
earlier. Another declaration stated that all the
Chinese territories taken by Japan would be
restored to her. In 1943, Churchill, Roosevelt
and Stalin, leaders of Britain, USA and the
Soviet Union, respectively, met at Teheran.
They declared their resolve to “banish the scourge
and terror of war and to create a world in
which all peoples may live free lives untouched
by tyranny and according to their varying
desires and their own consciences“.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Yalta Conference</i></strong></div>

Early in 1945 when Germany was on the
verge of defeat, the heads of the three big
nations met at Yalta in the Soviet Union. Here
they agreed on a number of issues such as how
to deal with Germany and the non-German
territories which had been liberated from
Germany.
<br>
<br>
The Yalta Conference also took the decision
to set up a new organisation to replace the
League of Nations.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Birth of United Nations</i></strong></div>

Subsequently, a conference was held at
San Francisco, USA, from 25 April 1945. The
conference was attended by 50 nations. On 26
June the conference adopted the United Nations
Charter under which a new world organization
was set up This was the United Nations
Organization which was based on the principle
of “the sovereign equality of all peace loving
states” The purposes of the United Nations
Organization were to maintain international
peace and security, to develop friendly relations
among nations and to achieve international
cooperation in solving international problems of
an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian
character to carry out these objectives, six principal
organs of the United Nations Organization
(now referred to as the United Nations or
simply the UN) were created these were:
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>the General Assembly composed of all the
members of the UN;</li>
        <li>the Security Council composed of five
permanent members, viz. the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China,
and six others to be elected by the General
Assembly for a period of two years The
Security Council was made primarily
responsible for the maintenance of peace and
security (The number of nonpermanent
members was subsequently raised from six
to ten );</li>
        <li>the Economic and Social Council of 18
members to promote “respect for, and
observance of, human rights and
fundamental freedoms for all”</li>
        <li>the Trusteeship Council</li>
        <li>the International Court of Justice</li>
        <li>the Secretariat with a Secretary General
appointed by the General Assembly as its
head.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


A number of specialized agencies of the
UN were also created such as the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO), the World Health
Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO), the International Labour
Organization (ILO) (this body had been created
after the First World War), etc. It was realized
that unless all the permanent members of the
Security Council, who were at that time the
biggest powers, were agreed, no course of action
for the maintenance of peace and security could
be effective. Hence it was provided that any
decision of the Security Council must have the
support of all five permanent members. The
setting up of the United Nations was one of the
most important consequences of the Second
World War.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Potsdam Conference</i></strong></div>

Another major conference of the heads of
government of Britain, the United States and
the Soviet Union was held at Potsdam (near
Berlin) from 17 July to 2 August 1945. The
declaration issued by this conference mentioned
the main aims of the Allies with regard to
Germany which had already surrendered
Germany had been partitioned into four zones,
each under the control of Britain, France, the
United States and the Soviet Union. The
declaration stated that the aim of the Allied
occupation of Germany was to bring about the
complete disarmament of Germany, to destroy
the Nazi Party and to prepare conditions for the
creation of a democratic Germany. It was also
decided to set up an international tribunal to
bring to trial persons who had committed crimes
against humanity. Decisions were also taken
regarding the border between Poland and
Germany, and the transfer of the northern part
of East Prussia to the Soviet Union and the
southern part to Poland. The various conferences
held during and after the war influenced the
political developments after the war.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>EUROPE AFTER THE SECOND WORLD
WAR:- REDRAWAL OF BOUNDARIES.</i></strong></div>

Many countries in Europe had been
liberated from German occupation by the Soviet
armies. These countries were Poland, Hungary,
Rumania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
The Communist parties and other antifascist
parties in these countries had played an
important role in the struggle against German
occupation of these countries. By the end of
1948, the governments of all these countries
were dominated by the Communist parties. In
Albania and Yugoslavia, the struggle against
German occupation had, been led by the
Communist parties of these countries. In these
countries too Communist parties formed the
governments. The establishment of the
Communist parties’ rule in these countries was
a significant development after the Second World
War Up to the Second World War, the only
country in Europe, and the world, ruled by a
Communist party was the Soviet Union. Now
a large number of European countries were
ruled by Communist parties. In these countries,
other political parties were either not allowed to
exist or had only a nominal presence. The
political power was exclusively in the hands of
the Communist parties.
<br>
<b></b>
The presence of Soviet troops in these
countries ensured the continuance of the
Communist parties’ monopoly of power.
Sometimes, the Soviet troops were used to
suppress movements which opposed the
domination of Communist parties. Within the
Communist parties themselves, differences over
policies were not allowed and the power within,
the Communist parties became concentrated in
a few hands. As in the Soviet Union, dissent
even within the ruling parties was not tolerated
and many veteran communists were shot or
sentenced to long periods of imprisonment after
fake trials. Sometimes these countries were
branded as ‘satellites’ of the Soviet Union. The
Communist party of Yugoslavia was the only
ruling Communist Party which refused to be
dominated by the Soviet Union. But at the same
time, the government of Yugoslavia did not
allow other political parties to function.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Germany</i></strong></div>

Within a little more than four years after
the end of the Second World War, certain
developments took place which resulted in the
division of Germany. The four powers —Britain,
France, the United States and the Soviet Union
which were in occupation of four different
zones of Germany followed different policies in
dealing with the social, economic and political
problems in their respective zones. In the British,
French and American zones, the economic
development continued on capitalist lines. The
two major parties in these zone, were the
Christian Democratic Party and the Social
Democratic Party. In 1948, Brain, France and
the United States decided to merge the three
zones under their control which were in West
Germany and form a separate government there.
In September 1949 these zones were united and
a separate state in West Germany called the
Federal Republic of Germany with its capital at
Bonn came into being.
<br>
<br>
In East Germany which was under Soviet
occupation, the policies pursued were different
from those that had been followed in the western
zones. Lands were distributed among peasants
and all the major industries were taken over
from private hands and made the property of
the state. In 1946 the Communist Party and the
Social Democratic Party in the Soviet zone of
Germany merged to form the Socialist Unity
Party of Germany. In October 1949, the Soviet
zone became a separate state called the German
Democratic Republic. The Socialist Unity Party
of Germany became the ruling party in the
German Democratic Republic. Thus Germany
came to be divided into two states, each following
its own pattern of social, economic and political
development. The division of Germany into two
independent states, which lasted for over four
decades, was a major consequence of the Second
World War.
<br>
<br>
The division of Germany had been a source
of tension in Europe and a major factor in the
Cold War. East Berlin was the capital of East
Germany (German Democratic Republic or GDR)
while West Berlin which was located within the
GDR territory was treated as a part of West
Germany (Federal Republic of Germany or FRG).
In 1961, the GDR authorities built a wall
between East and West Berlin to prevent East
Germans from going away to West Berlin.
The building of the wall became a further
source of tension in Europe. The process of
ending communist rule in GDR and of the
reunification of Germany began in 1989 when
the Berlin Wall was opened and political parties
which were outside the control of the communist
party (called the Socialist Unity Party) were
allowed to function. In early 1990 elections
were held and a new government came to
power. On 3 October 1990, the division of
Germany was ended and a unified Germany
again emerged.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>France and Italy: rise of communism</i></strong></div>

In other parts of Europe also, important
political changes took place. The Communist
parties of France and Italy had played an
important role in the resistance movements in
these countries. They had emerged as powerful
parties at the end of the war.
In the first government formed in France
after the war, the Communist Party of France
was represented. However, it quit the
government in 1947 because of differences over
economic policies and over the question of
independence for the countries comprising
IndoChina. The French government was trying
to reestablish its rule over IndoChina which the
Communist Party opposed.
<br>
<br>
In the Italian government, the Communist
Party and the Socialist Party were an important
force. In 1946, monarchy was abolished and
Italy became a republic. In 1947 the Christian
Democratic Party came to power and the
Communist Party quit the government.
However, even though the Communist and
Socialist parties were out of the government in
these two countries, they were together a
powerful force in the politics of the two countries.
For many years, in both these countries, the
socialist parties became the ruling parties either
alone or in alliance with other parties The
Communist parties, however, were almost
throughout the period after 1948 kept out of the
government. In recent years, while the Italian
Communist Party —it is now called the
Democratic Party of the Left–has remained a
powerful force, the influence of the French
Communist Party has declined.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Britain: Rise of Labour Party</i></strong></div>

In Britain, the elections were held in July
1945. The Conservative Party whose leader
Winston Churchill had been the Prime Minister
during the war lost and the Labour Party came
to power. India won her independence during
this period. During the Labour Party’s rule
many significant changes took place in the
economy of the country. Many important
industries such as coal mines and railways were
nationalized. Steps were taken to provide social
security to the people, and to build a welfare
state in Britain. In 1951, the Conservative Party
was returned to power and the Labour Party
became the ruling party in 1964. Thus, neither
of these parties remained in power for long and
both of the parties were more or less equally
matched. Only in recent years, there seems to
have been a decline in the influence of the
Labour Party.
<br>
<br>
The political system in most countries of
Western Europe was based on the parliamentary
form of government. Their economies had
suffered a serious setback, and it affected their
international position. Gradually through their
own efforts and with massive American aid,
these countries were soon on the way to rebuild
their economies However, the domination that
these countries exercised over the world before
the First World War and to a lesser extent after
that had declined. The period after the Second
World War saw the rapid decline of their
empires.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Eastern Europe</i></strong></div>

Many changes of great historical
importance have taken place in the Soviet Union
and in countries of Eastern and Central Europe.
The most significant of these has been the
collapse of the Soviet Union and the ending of
the communist regimes there and in other
countries of Europe. In 1956, three years after
the death of Stalin, the Communist Party of
Soviet Union had denounced the excesses and
crimes committed by Stalin. From 1985, many
important reforms began to be introduced m the
political system of the Soviet Union with a view
to promoting political democracy. There was
free and open discussion on every issue and
curbs on the freedom of thought and expression
were lifted.
<br>
<br>
Reforms in economy were also initiated to
end the stagnation that had set in and to
improve the living conditions of the people. The
importance of these reforms was recognized the
world over. The hold of the Communist Party
over the political life of the country was loosened
and other political parties were allowed to
function.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Fall of USSR</i></strong></div>

In the meantime, there was a demand for
greater autonomy by the republics which
constituted the Soviet Union. Some republics
wanted to become independent. Attempts were
made to frame a new treaty which would
provide greater autonomy to the republics and
at the same time preserve the Union However,
in August 1991, there was an attempt to stage
a coup by some leaders of the Communist Party.
Though the coup collapsed, the Soviet Union
began to break up. Many republics declared
their independence. On 25 December
1991, Mikhail Gorbachev, who was the President
of the Soviet Union during this period and had
initiated the reforms mentioned earlier, resigned
and the Soviet Union formally ceased to exist.
In place of the Soviet Union which had been a
major influence on world historical development
for about seven decades, there emerged 15
independent republics. Though the rule of the
communist par ties has ended in all these
republics, many of them are faced with serious
political and economic problems. There are also
many problems between the republics although
12 of them have formed a loose federation called
the Commonwealth of Independent States.
<br>
<br>
Equally important changes have taken place in
those countries of Europe which were ruled by
communist parties. There had been outbursts of
resentment in some of these countries against
Soviet control and against the Soviet supported
communist governments since the 1950s. There
were occasions when Soviet troops were used
to suppress the unrest in these countries. The
changes in the Soviet Union affected these
countries directly. There were mass upheavals
in all these countries in the late 1980s. By 1989,
Soviet control over them came to an end. The
monopoly of political power enjoyed by the
communist parties in these countries was ended.
There were free elections and new governments
were formed. It is notable that these far reaching
changes took place in most countries without
the use of violence. In some countries, leaders
who had misused their position for personal
gain and power were tried and jailed. Many
communist parties — no longer ruling parties in
their countries — expelled some of their former
leaders who had committed excesses when they
were in power. In one country, Romania, the
Communist Party leader who for about 15 years
had been the virtual dictator was executed. The
Warsaw Pact, the military alliance which was
headed by the Soviet Union and of which the
communist ruled states of Europe were
members, was dissolved in 1991.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Retreat of Socialism</i></strong></div>

The collapse of the Soviet Union and of
communist governments in Europe has been a
major factor in ending the Cold War. It has also
been seen as marking the retreat of socialism. It
can, however, be said that the system which
was built in these countries was only a distorted
version of the socialist ideal and that social
justice which was fundamental to that ideal has
become a part of the consciousness of the people
the world over.
<br>
<br>
The changes in Eastern and Central Europe,
as in the former Soviet Union, have not been
without problems, both economic and political.
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Czechoslovakia had emerged as a new state
after the First World War has broken up into
two independent states — the Czech Republic
and the Slovak Republic.</li>
        <li>In unified Germany, there have been many
instances of violence by neo Nazis against
immigrants</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Bosnia</i></strong></div>

Developments of a tragic nature have taken
place in Yugoslavia in recent years. Yugoslavia
which had emerged as a state after the First
World War was ruled by a communist party
since the end of the Second World War. The
communist government of Yugoslavia had kept
itself free from the Soviet Union almost from the
beginning. Yugoslavia was one of the founders
of the Non-Aligned Movement. She was a
federation of six republics. In four of these
republics, the rule of the communist parties
came to an end in 1990. By 1992, Yugoslavia
broke up into five independent states —the new
state of Yugoslavia comprising
<ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Serbia and Montenegro,</li>
        <li>Croatia,</li>
        <li>Macedonia,</li>
        <li>Slovenia</li>
        <li>Bosnia-Herzegovina</li>
    </ul>
</ol>


However, the problems of Yugoslavia did
not end with its breakup. A large party of BosniaHerzegovina is under the control of Serbians and
Croats. A bloody war has been going on between
Bosnian Croats, Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian
Muslims, particularly between the latter two,
causing terrible sufferings to the people.
While these developments have taken place
in one part of Europe, in another, Western, part
(including Germany), there had been a move
towards European unity. It consists in creating
a Europe without borders, with a common
currency and unrestricted movement of goods
and people and ultimately a political union with
a common parliament. Some steps have already
been taken in this direction. It may, however, be
remembered that the concept of European unity
at present excludes all East European countries
and some others.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WEST ASIA & AFRICA:</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>DECOLONIZATION & INDEPENDENCE</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>WEST ASIA INDEPENDENCE</i></strong></div>

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Syria and Lebanon</i></strong></div>

As in other parts of Asia, there was an
upsurge for freedom in West Asia also
immediately after the Second World War. After
the war, the French tried to restore their authority
over Syria and Lebanon but, in the face of
opposition from the people of these countries
and the world opinion, they were forced to
withdraw. Both Syria and Lebanon became
independent by the end of 1946.
There was an upsurge in all the Arab
countries at this time and the 1950s saw their
emergence as independent nations. Some
countries which had been nominally free asserted
their independence. There were also movements
to overthrow the outdated political systems
which existed in some countries. All these led
to conflicts and, in some cases, prolonged wars
between the Arab countries and the imperialist
powers. The period saw the growing power of
Arab nationalism which led to efforts by the
Arab people and governments to come together
to face and solve common problems. The Arab
League was formed comprising all the Arab
states.
<br>
<br>
However, before many of the Arab countries
could gain their independence, a development
took place in West Asia which was to become
a source of tension and lead to many wars in
the years to come. This was the creation of the
state of Israel.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Israel</i></strong></div>

Palestine, as has been mentioned before,
had become a British mandate in 1919. The
British troops again occupied the country in
1945. Palestine was inhabited by Arabs and
Jews. A movement called the Zionist
movement claimed that Palestine was the
homeland of all the Jews, wherever they may be
living, and should be restored to them. The
persecution which the Jews in Europe had
suffered for centuries had culminated in the Nazi
Germany’s policy of exterminating them. Millions
of Jews were killed in Germany and in those
countries of Europe which had been occupied by
Germany. The terrible tragedy had won them the
sympathy and support of the world.
The British in Palestine had permitted some
Jews from outside Palestine to settle there. The
Zionists had, meanwhile, been campaigning for
a Jewish state there. This had complicated the
freedom movement in Palestine the majority of
whose inhabitants were Arabs. In 1947 the
United Nations passed a resolution according to
which Palestine was to be divided into an Arab
state and a Jewish state. However, in 1948, the
British withdrew their troops from Palestine
and soon after the state of Israel was proclaimed.
This led to a war between the Arab states and
Israel. The Arab states were defeated in the war.
The creation of Israel became a source of
tension in West Asia. The Arab states refused to
recognize her as a legitimate state, The policies
pursued by the government of Israel further
added to the bitterness. About 900,000 Arabs
were forced to leave their homes and lands in
Palestine and were rendered homeless. They
found shelter in various refugee camps in Arab
states. Most countries of Asia and Africa
condemned the Israeli government’s treatment
of the Arabs of Palestine and for following racist
policies. In 1956, Israel joined Britain and France
in invading Egypt. Later there were other wars
between Israel and the Arab states as a result
of which Israel occupied large parts of the
territories of other Arab states.
<br>
<br>
These territories include the Gaza Strip, the
Golan Heights and the West Bank. More than
a million Palestinians live in the occupied
territories. In spite of the resolutions of the
United Nations, Israel refuse to vacate Arab
territories and restore the rights of the Palestinian
Arabs, many of whom live as refugees in various
Arab states. In 1964, the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) was formed to fight for the
establishment of a Palestinian state. It enjoys the
status of a member-state of the Non-Aligned
Movement. Recently an agreement was signed
between the government of Israel and the PLO.
Under this agreement, the PLO recognized the
state of Israel and the government of Israel
agreed to give the Palestinians autonomy in
some areas presently under Israeli occupation.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>AFRICAN INDEPENDENCE</i></strong></div>

With the exception of Ethiopia and Liberia,
almost every part of Africa had been conquered
by European imperialist powers by the end of
the nineteenth century. After the First World
War, the only change that took place there was
the transfer of the former German colonies in
Africa to the victorious Allied powers. However,
the period after the First World War saw, as in
Asia, a resurgence of nationalist movements in
Africa. After the Second World War, the
disintegration of the colonial rule in Africa
began. The achievement of independence by
North African countries has been mentioned
already. The countries of southern Africa began
to gain their independence after the mid1950s.
Within two decades, almost every country in
Africa, with the exception of South Africa and
South-West Africa (Namibia), became
independent.
<br>
<br>
The freedom movements in Africa, as in
other parts of the world, were the consequence
of the growth of nationalism and the increasing
resentment against the exploitation and
oppression by the colonial countries. The
international situation further strengthened these
movements. The Second World War had resulted
in the general weakening of imperialism. It had
also shattered the myth of the invincibility of
some major colonial powers in Africa such as
France and Belgium which had suffered defeat
in Europe during the war. The collapse of
colonialism in Asia within a few years after the
war also had a tremendous impact on freedom
movements in Africa. The question of Africa’s
freedom gradually became one of the major
issues in the world.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Egypt: Naseer</i></strong></div>

After the First World War, Egypt had
become a British ‘mandate’. However, under
the pressure of the nationalist movement, Egypt
had been declared independent in 1922, though
British troops continued to remain there. After
the Second World War, the demand for the
withdrawal of British troops gained strength.
There were serious clashes between the Egyptians
and the British soldiers in which hundreds of
Egyptians were killed. The discontent was also
directed against the king of Egypt who had been
installed by the British. The discontent against
the British and the king led to a revolution in
1952 when the Egyptian army under the
leadership of Lt.Colonel Gamal Abdal Naseer
and General Muhammad Naguib overthrew the
monarchy and declared Egypt a republic. The
new Egyptian government demanded the
withdrawal of British troops and they were
withdrawn in June 1956.
<br>
<br>
The government of Egypt under the
leadership of Col Nasser began the economic
reconstruction of the country. Egypt refused to
be aligned with the United States and the latter
stopped the sale of arms to Egypt. Egypt,
however, began to receive military and economic
aid from the Soviet Union. In 1956, Egypt
announced the nationalization to the Suez
Canal which had been under the control of
Britain and France. Three months later, Israel,
Britain and France, according to a plan, invaded
Egypt. The aggression committed against Egypt
led to worldwide protests. The countries of Asia
voiced their vehement condemnation of the
invasion. There were massive protest
demonstrations against the British government
inside Britain also. The Soviet Union warned the
aggressor countries that unless they withdrew
from Egypt, she would send her forces to crush
the aggressors. Almost every country in the
world, including the United States, denounced
Britain, France and Israel in the United Nations.
The universal condemnation of aggression led
to the withdrawal of British and French forces
from Egypt. The ending of aggression
strengthened further the unity of Asian and
African countries in general and of Arab
countries in particular. It also showed the
growing strength of the countries which had
won their independence only a few years ago.
The Suez War also added to the prestige and
influence of the Soviet Union as a friend of the
peoples who were trying to assert their
independence.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Libya: Gaddafi</i></strong></div>

Libya came under Italian rule in 1911.
During the Second World War, some of the
most ferocious battles between German and
British troops were fought in Libya. At the end
of the war, the country was occupied by Britain
and France. In 1951, Libya became independent
with a monarchical form of government. From
1960 she became one of the largest petroleum
producing countries in the world and as a result
some sections of Libyan society grew very rich
while the majority of the population remained
extremely backward. The king did not permit
any opposition to his rule. The United States
built one of its strongest air bases on Libyan
territory. In 1969, a group of army officers
captured power and soon after abolished the
monarchy. The new government proclaimed
that it would give primacy to the unity and
solidarity of the Arab people.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Algeria</i></strong></div>

The 1950s saw the emergence of a number
of independent nations in North Africa.
However, the independence was preceded by
years of struggle against the imperialist countries
which wanted to retain their colonial
possessions. As in Indo China, the French
returned to Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria.
However, in 1956 Tunisia and Morocco won
their independence.
<br>
<br>
The North African country which had to
wage the longest and the hardest battle for
freedom was Algeria. She had been conquered
by France as early as 1830 though it had taken
France another four decades to fully establish
her rule there. As in Indo China, the struggle
against French rule in Algeria had a long history
behind it. In 1954 the nationalist organisation of
the people of Algeria called the FLN (National
Liberation Front) gave a call for an armed
struggle against the French rule Armed clashes
resulted in thousands of casualties on both
sides. By 1958, the Algerian nationalists had
organized a large army of their own and
proclaimed the formation of a government of
the republic of Algeria. The war in Algeria had
serious consequences inside France. It created
political instability in France. The Communist
Party of France along with many other French
leaders had been supporting the cause of
Algerian independence. However, many sections
in the French army were under the influence of
the French settlers in Algeria who were opposed
to any negotiations with the Algerian leaders
over the question of independence. In
1958, General de Gaulle became the President
of France. He conceded the right of the Algerian
people to self-determination and opened
negotiations with the leaders of the FLN.
This policy was opposed by some sections
of the French army in Algeria, who revolted
against de Gaulle and even made attempts to
assassinate him. However, the revolt was
suppressed. On 1 July 1962, a referendum was
held in Algeria and the people of Algeria voted
almost unanimously for independence. On 4
July 1962 Algeria became an independent
republic. The independence of Algeria had been
won at the cost of over 140,000 Algerian lives.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Ghana</i></strong></div>

The first country in southern Africa to gain
independence was Ghana. There was a powerful
kingdom of Ghana in West Africa during the
eighth to the twelfth centuries. The British had
conquered a part of this region to which they
gave the name Gold Coast. The most prominent
leader of the people of the Gold Coast colony
was Kwame Nkrumah, who in 1949 had
organized the Convention People’s Party. A
strong trade union movement had also emerged
in Gold Coast. The Convention People’s Party
and the trade unions joined together to demand
independence from Britain. However, most of
their leaders were arrested and attempts were
made to suppress the demand for freedom.
After 1950, the British government started
introducing certain constitutional reforms.
Under pressure from the People’s Party which
had won a resounding victory in elections, the
British government agreed to the independence
of Gold Coast. The new independent state
which came into being on 6 March 1957 called
itself Ghana, after the name of the old West
African kingdom. The part of Togoland which
had been under British control also joined Ghana.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Guinea</i></strong></div>

The next country to achieve her
independence was the French colony of Guinea
in West Africa. In 1958, while embroiled in the
war in Algeria, France held a referendum in her
colonies which had been grouped together as
French West Africa and French Equatorial
Africa. The people of Guinea voted for complete
independence and Guinea was proclaimed a
republic on 2 October 1958.
<br>
<br>
The achievement of independence by Ghana
and Guinea gave additional confidence to the
freedom movements in other parts of Africa and
accelerated the pace of achievement of
independence by other nations. The promotion
of the cause of African freedom was a major
objective of India’s foreign policy from the time
India won her independence. India’s struggle
for freedom had also been a source of inspiration
to African nationalists.
The year 1960 is generally regarded as the
Africa Year. In that year, seventeen countries in
Africa gained their independence. These included
all the French colonies in French West Africa
and Equatorial Africa, Nigeria and Congo
(formerly Belgian Congo, now called Zaire).
Between 1961 and 1964, a number of
countries in East and Central Africa also became
independent. These were Kenya, Uganda,
Tanganyika, Zanzibar, Nyasaland, Northern
Rhodesia, Rwanda and Burundi.
Sierra Leone, Gambia, Lesotho (formerly
Basutoland) and Botswana (formerly
Bechuanaland) also gained their independence.
<br>
<br>
<b>Kenya:</b> Mau Mau rebellion
The freedom movement in Kenya was led
by Jomo Kenyatta, leader of the Kenya African
Union. In 1952, a revolt by peasants had broken
out. This is known as the Mau Mau rebellion.
It was directed against the seizure of land by the
British colonial authorities. To suppress the
rebellion, 15,000 Kenyans were killed and about
80,000 sent to concentration camps. Jomo
Kenyatta was imprisoned in 1953 on the charge
of supporting the Mau Mau rebellion. Having
failed to suppress the freedom movement, Britain
had to give in and Kenya became independent
in 1963.
Many of the newly independent countries
of Africa faced serious problems during the
years following their independence. The
imperialist powers tried their best hi maintain
their hold over their former colonies by direct
intervention and by creating dissensions. In
Congo, for instance, Belgium, with the help of
some other countries and the mercenaries from
various countries, brought about the secession
of the rich province of Katanga. On the appeal
of Patrice Lumumba, Prime Minister of Congo,
United Nations troops were sent to bring about
the withdrawal of foreign troops and
mercenaries. However, Patrice Lumumba was
assassinated and the country thrown into chaos
for a number of years.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Portuguese Colonies</i></strong></div>

Before the end of the 1960s, almost entire
Africa, with the exception of Portuguese colonies
of Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau and
Cape Verde Islands, and South Africa,
SouthWest Africa and Rhodesia, had become
free. Powerful freedom movements had started
in the Portuguese colonies. They had organized
their liberation forces and had secured the help
of many countries in their struggle for freedom.
In April 1974, the Portuguese army, which had
been mainly used to suppress the freedom
struggles in the colonies, overthrew the 50 year
old dictatorship in Portugal with the support of
the people. The communists, socialists and other
radical elements in the armed forces and the
new government of Portugal were opposed to
the continuation of the Portuguese rule in Africa.
They entered into negotiations with the freedom
movements in the Portuguese colonies and by
1975 all the former Portuguese colonies in Africa
became independent. Zimbabwe (formerly
Southern Rhodesia) became independent in April
1980.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>South Africa: Apartheid</i></strong></div>

South Africa — Union of South Africa
<br>
<br>
since 1910 and Republic of South Africa since
1961 —has been an independent country in the
sense that she was not ruled from another
country. The government of South Africa was,
however, among the most oppressive regimes in
the world in the twentieth century. It was under
the exclusive control of the white minority
practicing the worst form of racism. Under the
system of apartheid established in South Africa,
all people were classified and separated on the
basis of race. Each group had to live in a
separate area. There were separate schools and
universities, separate theatres, separate shopping
centres, separate coaches in trains for whites
and blacks and others. The teams for sports also
were formed on the basis of race. Marriage
between persons belonging to different races
was a criminal offence. There were restrictions
on movement from one, place to another. The
best lands in the country were under the control
of the whites who had all the economic and
Political power. The non-whites had no vote
and no say in the governance of the country.
The system of apartheid was used to maintain
the rule of the white minority over about 80 per
cent of the population which comprised black
and coloured people as well as people of Indian
origin. This system, in the name of separation
of the races, denied human rights to the majority
of the population.
<br>
<br>
It may be recalled that Mahatma Gandhi
had started the fight against racial discrimination
in South Africa long before he became a leader
of the freedom movement in India.
Demonstrators protesting against apartheid
laws were massacred at Sharpeville in South
Africa, 22 March 1960. The main organization
of the South African people which led the
movement for ending the rule of the white
minority and establishing a nonracist democratic
South Africa was the African National Congress
(ANC). It was set up in 1910. The movement
against the obnoxious system of apartheid was
intensified in the 1950s. The government
depended on the use of terror to maintain its
rule. There were incidents of massacres of
peaceful protestors. In 1960, the African National
Congress was banned and most of its leaders
were arrested The ANC then organized its own
army to fight .against the racist regime.
South Africa was increasingly isolated from
the rest of the world. India had been from the
beginning in the forefront in support of the
struggle to dismantle the apartheid regime. She
was the first country in the world to sever
relations with South Africa and to extend her
full support to the people of South Africa Many
other countries followed the suit. The United
Nations also condemned the policies of South
Africa. In the 1980s some Western countries
which had maintained military and economic
relations with South Africa also imposed
sanctions against her. By the end of the 1980s,
the international isolation of the South African
regime was complete.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Namibia</i></strong></div>

The last country in Africa to become
independent was Namibia, formerly South West
Africa. It was a German colony before the First
World War and was handed over to SouthAfrica as a ‘mandate’ after the defeat of Germany
in that war. South Africa treated South West
Africa as her colony and refused to withdraw
from there is spite of the resolutions of the
United Nations. The freedom movement there
was led by the SouthWest Africa People’s
Organization (SWAPO) which was formed in
1960. It gained momentum when SWAPO
started a war with the help of its guerilla forces
to liberate the country. It was made a member
of the Non Aligned Movement. The Non Aligned
Movement, the African governments and the
United Nations played an important role in the
success of the freedom movement in Namibia.
The war in Namibia came to an end in 1989
when South Africa agreed to a plan for the
independence of the country. SWAPO won a
majority of seats in the elections which were
held in November 1989 and on 21 March 1990
Namibia became independent.


<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Rest of Africa</i></strong></div>

Many African countries have changed their
names. The colonial powers had given them
names which had little to do with their past
history and culture. Some countries and cities
had been named after colonial adventurers, for
example, Rhodesia, Leopoldville, Stanleyville,
etc. The African peoples are trying to overcome
the damage caused to them during the colonial
rule. Renaming their countries and cities after
their original names is a part of their effort to
reestablish and assert their independence and
national identity. The need to unite in the face
of common tasks and for achieving common
aims led to the emergence of the unity of all
African states These aims included the
safeguarding of their independence and to help
the liberation movements in those countries in
Africa which were still fighting for their
independence. The most significant step taken
in this direction was the formation of the
Organdation of African Unity (OAU) in 1963.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>World after 1990</i></strong></div>

In spite of the many positive changes that
have taken place in recent years, the world in
the 1990s is not without tensions and conflicts.
While the danger of war involving the use of
nuclear weapons has ended, or at least receded,
there has been no reduction in the arsenals of
weapons of mass destruction. Their very
existence is a source of threat to the survival of
humankind. Similarly, with the end of the Cold
War, whether the world has moved, irreversibly,
to a period of detente and, much more
importantly, cooperation is still to be seen. With
the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States became the only super power in the
world. While the Warsaw Pact has been
dissolved, NATO, the military bloc headed by
the United States, has continued to exist. There
have been misgivings that the present situation
would make it possible for the United States, the
only super power now, to dictate to others.
The world in the 1990s, with all its problems,
is a very different place to live in compared with
any preceding age People the world over have
a much greater say in shaping their destiny than
ever before. For the first time in human history,
the creation of One World has become a
possibility in which all peoples would cooperate
with one another and would contribute their
best to enrich their own lives and of the entire
humankind

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>ASIAN COUNTRIES:
DECOLONIZATION & INDEPENDENCE</i></strong></div>

The growth of nationalism in Asia and
Africa occurred at a rapid pace in 19th century.
The period after the Second World War saw the
emergence of most countries of Asia and Africa
as independent nations. One country after
another in these continents became independent.
They won their independence through long and
hard struggles against colonial powers. To some
countries independence came only after long
and bitter armed, struggle, to others without
much bloodshed but not without a long period
of strife. Generally, the colonial powers were
not willing to give up their hold on the colonies
and left only when they found that it was not
possible to maintain their rule any more; During
the Second World War, many imperialist
countries had been ousted from their colonies,
but after the war they tried to reestablish their
rule. For some time they succeeded in doing so
but were ultimately forced to withdraw.
The achievement of independence was the
result primarily of the struggles of the peoples
of the colonies. However, the changes in the
international climate which followed the Second
World War helped the peoples struggling for
independence Imperialism as a whole had been
weakened as a result of the war. The economies
of many imperialist countries had suffered.
Forces within the imperialist countries which
were friendly with the peoples struggling for
independence also had grown powerful.
<br>
<br>
Freedom and democracy were the major aims
for which the Allies had fought against the
fascist countries and these aims had been made
the basis for arousing peoples all over the world
against fascism. The fulfillment of these aims
could no longer be confined only to Europe, as
had been done after the First World War. In
many colonies which fascist countries had
occupied by ousting the older colonial powers,
the freedom movements had played an
important role in the struggle against fascist
occupation. For example, Japan had to face the
resistance of the freedom movements in the
countries of East and South East Asia which she
had occupied. It was not easy to restore the rule
of the former colonial powers over these
countries.
<br>
<br>
Another major international factor which
facilitated the end of imperialism was the
emergence of the Soviet Union and other socialist
countries as a major force. These countries were
inimical to imperialism and often gave aid and
support to the freedom movements in the
colonies. Similarly, the movements of socialism
which had grown powerful the world over,
including in the colonial countries, also
supported the movements of freedom in the
colonies.
The entire international context in which
the freedom movements were launched had
changed after the Second World War. At the
international forums, particularly at the United
Nations, the cause of the independence of
colonies began to gain popularity. The
international opinion was clearly against the
continuation of imperialism. Imperialist countries
resorted to various means to maintain their rule.
They tried to create divisions in the freedom
movements. They resorted to the use of terror.
In some countries they tried to install
governments which were nominally free but
were in fact their puppets. However, most of the
freedom movements were able to defeat these
methods of disruption.
<br>
<br>
An important role in the achievement of
independence by the countries of Asia and
Africa was played by the unity which freedom
movements in various countries achieved. The
freedom movement in one country supported
the freedom movements in other countries. The
role of countries which had achieved their
independence was very crucial in this regard.
<br>
<br>
These countries supported the cause of those
peoples who were still under colonial rule at the
United Nations and other international forums.
They also gave active help to the freedom
movements. India played a crucial role in
promoting the cause of freedom in Asia and
Africa. Besides the movements in the colonies
for independence, there were also movements
in Asian and African countries to oust outdated
political systems, to modernize the social and
economic systems and to assume control over
the resources of one’s country which had
remained under foreign control even after
freedom. These movements expressed the resolve
of the peoples of Asia and Africa to become fully
independent as well as to launch programs of
rapid social and economic development. Within
two decades of the end of the Second World
War, the political map of Asia and Africa had
been completely changed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>India</i></strong></div>

Within a few years after the Second World
War, a large number of Asian countries became
independent, One of the first to win her
independence was India. India had, however,
been partitioned and along with India, another
independent state, Pakistan, also came into
being (Pakistan broke up in 1971 when her
eastern part —now Bangladesh—became
independent). The independence of India was
of great importance in the history of freedom
movements in Asia and Africa. The policies
pursued by the government of independent
India under the leadership her first Prime
minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, helped in
strengthening the freedom movements in other
countries and in hastening the achievement of
independence by them.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Burma</i></strong></div>

Burma, renamed Myanmar recently,
achieved her independence from Britain a few
months after India became independent. In
1944, the Antifascist People’s Freedom League
(AFPFL) had been formed in Burma. Its aim was
to resist the Japanese invasion of Burma and to
win independence for Burma. After the war,
the British tried to restore their rule over Burma.
This led to the intensification of the movement
for freedom. In the course of the struggle, many
leaders of the Burmese freedom movement were
assassinated. However, Britain was forced to
agree to the demand for freedom and Burma
became independent on 4 January 1948.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Indonesia</i></strong></div>

After the defeat of Japan, Sukarno, one of
the pioneers of the freedom movement in
Indonesia, proclaimed the independence of
Indonesia. However, soon after the British troops
landed there in order to help the Dutch to
restore their rule. The government of
independent Indonesia which had been formed
by Sukarno resisted the attempt to reestablish
colonial rule. There were demands in many
countries of the world to put an end to the war
which had been started in Indonesia to restore
the Dutch rule. In Asian countries, the reaction
was particularly intense. The leaders of the
Indian freedom movement demanded that
Indian soldiers, who had been sent to Indonesia
as a part of the British army should be
withdrawn. After India became free, she
convened a conference of Asian nations in
support of Indonesia’s independence. The
conference met in New Delhi in January 1949
and called for the complete independence of
Indonesia. The resistance of the Indonesian
people and the mounting pressure of world
opinion and Asian countries compelled Holland
to set the leaders of Indonesian people free. On
2 November 1949, Holland recognized the
independence of Indonesia.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Chinese Revolution</i></strong></div>

The unity between the Kuomintang and
the Communist Party of China which had been
built under the leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen
for the complete independence and unification
of China. This unity had been broken after the
death of Sun Yat-Sen and a civil war started in
China between the Kuomintang under the
leadership of Chiang Kai-Shek and the
Communist Party of China, whose most
important leader was Mao Zedong. After the
Japanese invasion of China, the two parties and
their armies cooperated for some time to resist
the Japanese aggression. However, the conflicts
between the two never ceased. The Kuomintang
under Chiang Kai-Shek was a party which
mainly represented the interests of capitalists
and landlords. The Communist Party, on the
other hand, was a party of workers and peasants.
In the areas under Communist Party’s control,
the estates of landlords had been expropriated
and the land distributed among the peasants.
Because of the policies pursued by the
Communist Party, it gradually had won over
millions of Chinese people to its side. The
Communist Party had also organized a huge
army called the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).
After the defeat of Japan and the driving out of
the Japanese forces from China, the civil war
again broke out. The government of the United
Stated gave massive aid to Chiang KaiShek, but
by 1949 his armies were completely routed.
With the remnants of his troops, Chiang KaiShek
went to Taiwan (Formosa), an island which had
been occupied by Japan after she had defeated
China in 1895.
<br>
<br>
On 1st October 1949, the People’s Republic
of China was proclaimed and the Communist
Party of China under the leadership of Mao
Zedong Came to power.
The victory of the Communist revolution in
China was a world shaking event. The most
populous country in the world had come under
communist rule. Besides the socialist countries
of Europe, there were now two mighty powers
in the world —the Soviet Union and China —
Which were ruled by communist parties.
Imperialism was further weakened in Asia as a
result of the Chinese revolution.
The establishment of the People’s Republic
of China was a defeat for the United-States. She
refused to recognize the government of China
for over two decades. According to the United
States, the legal government of China was that
of Chiang KaiShek in Taiwan (Formosa).
Because of the US attitude, the most populous
country in the world was denied even
membership of the United Nations for over two
decades.
<br>
<br>
For many years, friendly relations existed
between India and China. Together, the two
countries played a very important role in the
freedom movements of the peoples of Asia and
Africa and in bringing about the unity of the
Asian and African nations. However, towards
the end of the 1950s, the foreign policy of the
Chinese government began to change. In 1962,
China committed aggression against India which
dealt a severe blow not only to the friendship
between India and China but also to the unity
of Asian African nations. China’s relations with
the Soviet Union also began to deteriorate. She
supported Pakistan against India over various
issues. After 1970, her relations with the United
States began to improve. She was admitted to
the United Nations and is now one of the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council
(UNSC).
There were many turmoil in the political
and economic life of China after the
establishment of communist rule there. After
the death of Mao Zedong in 1975, many changes
have taken place in the economic policies of the
country. These are aimed at modernizing the
economy. For this, foreign companies and foreign
capital have been invited and are playing an
important role. Many practices which were at
one time considered basic to the concept of
socialism have been given up. There have also
been changes in China’s foreign policy. There
has been an improvement in China’s relations
with India. In the political life of China, however,
there has been little change and it continues to
be under the exclusive control of the Communist
Party. The demand for democracy voiced by
students and others some years ago was
suppressed.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Korean War</i></strong></div>

Korea, came under Japanese rule in 1910.
After Japan’s defeat in the Second World War,
she was divided into two zones, the northern
zone under Soviet occupation and the southern
zone under American occupation, to bring about
the surrender of Japanese troops. The aim was
to make Korea an independent state. However,
as in the case of Germany in Europe, two
different governments in Korea were formed in
1948. Rhee was an anti communist and wanted
an alliance with Chiang KaiShek to prevent the
spread of communism. Both the states organized
their armies and there were frequent clashes
between them. In 1948, the Soviet troops
withdrew from Korea followed by the American
troops who withdrew in 1949. Both the
governments of Korea favoured unification of
the country but there was no meeting ground
between them.
<br>
<br>
In June 1950 war broke out between North
and South Korea. The Chinese revolution had
already taken place and the United States feared
further expansion of communism in this area.
The United States sent troops to support South
Korea in the war. Troops from some other
countries aligned with the United States also
fought in Korea. These troops fought as the
troops of the United Nations because the Security
Council of the United Nations had passed a
resolution condemning North Korea and had
asked members of the United Nations to aid
South Korea. After the entry of the American
forces in the war, the Chinese forces also entered
the war and the situation took a very serious
turn. There was a real danger of another world
war breaking out, as by this time the Soviet
Union also had acquired atomic bombs.
However, though the war in Korea raged for
three years, it did not turn into a world war. The
armistice was signed in 1953 Korea remained
divided into two separate states. India played a
very important role in bringing the war in Korea
to an end. Even though the war was confined
to Korea, hundreds of thousands of people were
killed, including over 142,000 Americans.
The Korean war added to the danger of
another world war. It also worsened the tensions
in the world and led to the intensification of the
Cold War.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vietnam Partition</i></strong></div>

One of the most heroic battles for freedom
was fought by the people of Vietnam. This
country along with Laos and Cambodia
comprised Indo China which had come under
French colonial rule. After the French
government surrendered to Germany, many
parts of Indo China were occupied by Japan.
The movement for the freedom of Indo China
from French rule had started many years earlier.
The greatest leader of the people of Vietnam
was Ho Chi Minh. He had been engaged in
organizing the communist and the nationalist
movements in Vietnam since soon after the end
of the First World War. The Vietnamese people
under Ho Chi Minh’ s leadership resisted the
Japanese occupation and organized a people’s
army called the Viet Minh. By the time the
Second World War ended, the Viet Mirth
controlled a large part of Vietnam. In August
1945, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was
proclaimed with Ho ChiMinh as President.
However, the British troops as well as the troops
of Chiang KaiShek arrived in Vietnam in the
pretext of completing the surrender of Japanese
troops there. In October 1945, the French troops
also arrived with the aim of restoring French
rule. In 1946, the French army started fighting
against the Viet Minh. They also set up a
government with Bao Dal, who had headed the
puppet government under Japan earlier, as the
ruler. The war between the Viet Minh and
France continued for eight years. In 1954, the
French forces suffered a severe blow at the
hands of the done to Vietnam as a result of the
heavy Viet Minh at the fortress of Dien-BienPhu. The French defeat at Dien-Bien-Phu has
become famous because a people’s army without
any sophisticated defeated the army of a
powerful imperialist country. The debacle at
Dien-Bien-Phu compelled the French government
to start negotiations with the government of
Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In July 1954
an international conference was held at Geneva.
It was agreed to partition Vietnam temporarily
into North Vietnam South Vietnam and to hold
elections all over Vietnam within two years to
unify the country under a single government.
Cambodia and Laos, the other two countries
of Indo-China were made independent.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Vietnam War</i></strong></div>
With the partition of Vietnam, another
phase in the freedom movement in Vietnam
began. The government that was established in
South Vietnam, with the support of the United
States, refused to abide by the decisions of the
Geneva conference with regard to the holding
of elections and the unification of Vietnam. It
came to be increasingly regarded as being under
the control of the United States which was
opposed to the unification of Vietnam under the
leader ship of the communist party. In the early
1960s, uprisings broke out in South Vietnam
against the government there. This was followed
by the massive military intervention of the
United States in Vietnam. Hundreds of
thousands of American troops were sent there
with some of the most advanced weaponry to
suppress the popular uprising. The war
continued for a number of years. The South
Vietnamese people led by the National Liberation
Front carried on guerilla warfare. They had the
support of North Vietnam. The American troops
carried the war into North Vietnam. Incalculable
damage was done to Vietnam as a result of the
heavy bombings by American forces. The
American troops also used weapons of
bacteriological warfare. Vast areas of Vietnam
were devastated and hundreds of thousands of
people killed, The American forces also suffered
heavy casualties.
<br>
<br>
The United States was almost completely
isolated in the world over the war in Vietnam.
Besides the opposition to this war by scores of
governments, there was a worldwide movement
of protest against the U.S. government and of
solidarity with the people of Vietnam. The only
movement of this kind had emerged in the
1930s in support of the Republican cause in the
Spanish Civil War and against Germany and
Italy who were actively helping the fascists in
Spain. The opposition to the war grew in the
United States itself on an unprecedented scale.
Thousands of Americans refused to be drafted
in the U.S. army and many American soldiers
deserted. No other single issue had united
millions of people all over the world as the war
in Vietnam. However, the U.S government
continued the war even though it was clear that
she could not win it.
Early in 1975, the war took a decisive turn.
The armies of North Vietnam and of the National
Liberation Front of South Vietnam swept across
the country routing the American supported
troops of the government of South Vietnam. In
January 1973, the American troops had begun
to withdraw from Vietnam. During the war in
Vietnam, 58,000 of them had lost their lives. By
30 April 1975, all the American troops had
withdrawn and the capital of South Vietnam,
Saigon, was liberated. North and South Vietnam
were formally united as one country in 1976.
The city of Saigon was renamed Ho Chi-Minh
City after the great leader of the Vietnamese
people who had died a few years earlier in 1969.
The emergence of Vietnam as a united and
independent nation is an historic event in the
history of the world. A small country had
succeeded in winning her independence and
unification in the face of the armed opposition
of the greatest power in the world. The help
given to Vietnam by the socialist countries, the
political support extended to her by a large
number of Asian and African countries, and the
solidarity expressed by the peoples in all parts
of the world had helped in bringing victory to
the people of Vietnam.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Cambodia: Khmer Rouge</i></strong></div>

The war in Vietnam had also spread to
Cambodia In 1970, the government of Prince
Narodom Sihanouk was overthrown and a
puppet government was installed there. The
troops of the USA and South Vietnam had
carried the war to Cambodia on the ground that
the Vietnamese were receiving their supplies
from bases in Cambodia. By the time the United
States withdrew from the war in 1975, a party
which called itself Khmer Rouge had taken
control of Cambodia under the leadership of Pol
Pot. The government of Pol Pot established a
regime of terror in Cambodia and started
following a policy of genocide against its own
people. The estimates of people murdered by the
Khmer Rouge vary from one to three million.
In 1979, Pol Pot’s government was overthrown
with the help of Vietnamese troops. However,
the war in Cambodia continued as the Khmer
Rouge still had some areas under its control
inside the country. It also operated from across
the border with Thailand. In the meantime,
three groups, including the Khmer Rouge and
the group led by Narodom Sihanouk, came
together in opposition to the government in
