<h3>Disintegration of USSR</h3>


In December of 1991, as the world watched
in amazement, the Soviet Union disintegrated
into fifteen separate countries. Its collapse was
hailed by the west as a victory for freedom, a
triumph of democracy over totalitarianism, and
evidence of the superiority of capitalism over
socialism. The United States rejoiced as its
formidable enemy was brought to its knees,
thereby ending the Cold War which had hovered
over these two superpowers since the end of
World War II. Indeed, the breakup of the Soviet
Union transformed the entire world political
situation, leading to a complete reformulation of
political, economic and military alliances all
over the globe.
<br>
<br>
What led to this monumental historical
event? In fact, the answer is a very complex one,
and can only be arrived at with an understanding
of the peculiar composition and history of the
Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was built on
approximately the same territory as the Russian
Empire which it succeeded. After the Bolshevik
Revolution of 1917, the newly-formed
government developed a philosophy of socialism
with the eventual and gradual transition to
Communism. The state which the Bolsheviks
created was intended to overcome national
differences, and rather to create one monolithic
state based on a centralized economical and
political system. This state, which was built on
a Communist ideology, was eventually
transformed into a totalitarian state, in which
the Communist leadership had complete control
over the country.
<br>
<br>
However, this project of creating a unified,
centralized socialist state proved problematic
for several reasons. First, the Soviets
underestimated the degree to which the nonRussian ethnic groups in the country (which
comprised more than fifty percent of the total
population of the Soviet Union) would resist
assimilation into a Russianized State. Second,
their economic planning failed to meet the
needs of the State, which was caught up in a
vicious arms race with the United States. This
led to gradual economic decline, eventually
necessitating the need for reform. Finally, the
ideology of Communism, which the Soviet
Government worked to instill in the hearts and
minds of its population, never took firm root,
and eventually lost whatever influence it had
originally carried.
<br>
<br>
By the time of the 1985 rise to power of
Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Union’s last
leader, the country was in a situation of severe
stagnation, with deep economic and political
problems which sorely needed to be addressed
and overcome. Recognizing this, Gorbachev
introduced a two-tiered policy of reform. On
one level, he initiated a policy of glasnost, or
freedom of speech. On the other level, he began
a program of economic reform known as
perestroika, or rebuilding. What Gorbachev did
not realize was that by giving people complete
freedom of expression, he was unwittingly
unleashing emotions and political feelings that
had been pent up for decades, and which
proved to be extremely powerful when brought
out into the open. Moreover, his policy of
economic reform did not have the immediate
results he had hoped for and had publicly
predicted. The Soviet people consequently used
their newly allotted freedom of speech to criticize
Gorbachev for his failure to improve the
economy.
<br>
<br>
The disintegration of the Soviet Union
began on the peripheries, in the non-Russian
areas. The first region to produce mass, organized
dissent was the Baltic region, where, in 1987,
the government of Estonia demanded autonomy.
This move was later followed by similar moves
in Lithuania and Latvia, the other two Baltic
republics. The nationalist movements in the
Baltics constituted a strong challenge to
Gorbachev’s policy of glasnost. He did not want
to crack down too severely on the participants
in these movements, yet at the same time, it
became increasingly evident that allowing them
to run their course would spell disaster for the
Soviet Union, which would completely collapse
if all of the periphery republics were to demand
independence.
<br>
<br>
After the initiative from Estonia, similar
movements sprang up all over the former Soviet
Union. In the Transcaucasus region (in the
South of the Soviet Union), a movement
developed inside the Armenian-populated
autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabagh, in
the Republic of Azerbaijan. The Armenian
population of this region demanded that they be
granted the right to secede and join the Republic
of Armenia, with whose population they were
ethnically linked. Massive demonstrations were
held in Armenia in solidarity with the
secessionists in Nagorno-Karabagh. The
Gorbachev government refused to allow the
population of Nagorno-Karabagh to secede,
and the situation developed into a violent
territorial dispute, eventually degenerating into
an all-out war which continues unabated until
the present day.
Once this “Pandora’s box” had been
opened, nationalist movements emerged in
Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Byelorussia, and
the Central Asian republics. The power of the
Central Government was considerably
weakened by these movements; they could no
longer rely on the cooperation of Government
figures in the republics.
<br>
<br>
Finally, the situation came to a head in
August of 1991. In a last-ditch effort to save the
Soviet Union, which was floundering under the
impact of the political movements which had
emerged since the implementation of
Gorbachev’s glasnost, a group of “hard-line”
Communists organized a coup d’etat. They
kidnapped Gorbachev, and then, on August 19
of 1991, they announced on state television that
Gorbachev was very ill and would no longer be
able to govern. The country went into an uproar.
Massive protests were staged in Moscow,
Leningrad, and many of the other major cities
of the Soviet Union. When the coup organizers
tried to bring in the military to quell the protestors,
the soldiers themselves rebelled, saying that
they could not fire on their fellow countrymen.
After three days of massive protest, the coup
organizers surrendered, realizing that without
the cooperation of the military, they did not
have the power to overcome the power of the
entire population of the country.
After the failed coup attempt, it was only
a few months until the Soviet Union completely
collapsed. Both the government and the people
realized that there was no way to turn back the
clock; the massive demonstrations of the “August
days” had demonstrated that the population
would accept nothing less than democracy.
Gorbachev conceded power, realizing that he
could no longer contain the power of the
population. On December 25, 1991, he resigned.
By January of 1992, by popular demand, the
Soviet Union ceased to exist. In its place, a new
entity was formed. It was called the
“Commonwealth of Independent Republics,”
and was composed of most of the independent
countries of the former Soviet Union. While the
member countries had complete political
independence, they were linked to other
Commonwealth countries by economic, and, in
some cases, military ties.
<br>
<br>
Now that the Soviet Union, with its
centralized political and economic system, has
ceased to exist, the fifteen newly formed
independent countries which emerged in its
aftermath are faced with an overwhelming
task. They must develop their economies,
reorganize their political systems, and, in many
cases, settle bitter territorial disputes. A number
of wars have developed on the peripheries of
the former Soviet Union. Additionally, the entire
region is suffering a period of severe economic
hardship. However, despite the many hardships
facing the region, bold steps are being taken
toward democratization, reorganization, and
rebuilding in most of the countries of the former
Soviet Union.

Contemporary issue of Russia and Ukraine
The two neighboring countries have been
intertwined for over 1,000 years of tumultuous
history. Today, Ukraine is one of Russia's biggest
markets for natural gas exports, a crucial transit
route to the rest of Europe, and home to an
estimated 7.5 million ethnic Russians — who
mostly live in eastern Ukraine and the southern
region of Crimea. (All told, about 25 percent of
Ukraine's 46 million people claim Russian as
their mother tongue.) Russia lacks natural
borders like rivers and mountains along its
western frontier, so "its leaders have traditionally
seen the maintenance of a sphere of influence
over the countries around it as source of
security.That's especially true of Ukraine, which
Russia regards as its little brother.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Independent Ukraine</i></strong></div>

After both Ukraine and Russia terminated
the union several acute disputes formed. The
former one was the question of the Crimea which
the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic had
administered since 1954. This however was
largely resolved in an agreement that allowed
for Crimea to remain part of Ukraine, provided
its Autonomous Republic status is preserved.
The second major dispute of the 1990s was
the city of Sevastopol, with its base of the Black
Sea Fleet. Unlike the rest of the Crimea peninsula,
the city of Sevastopol carried a special status
within the Soviet Union. During the fall of the
Soviet state the city along with the rest of
Ukraine participated in the national referendum
for independence of Ukraine where 58% of its
population voted for the succession of the city
in favour of the Ukrainian state, yet the Supreme
Soviet of Russia voted to reclaim the city as its
territory in 1993 (a vote unrecognised by Boris
Yeltsin, at the time the Russian parliament and
president were at a political stand-off). After
several years of intense negotiations, in 1997 the
whole issue was resolved by partitioning
the Black Sea Fleet and leasing some of the
naval bases in Sevastopol to the Russian
Navy until 2017.
<br>
<br>
Another major dispute became the energy
supply problems as several Soviet-Western
Europe oil and gas pipelines ran through
Ukraine. Later after new treaties came into
effect, the enormous debts of Ukraine to Russia
were paid off by transfer of several Soviet
weaponry and nuclear arsenals that Ukraine
inherited, to Russia such as the Tu160 bombers. During the 1990s both countries
along with other ex-Soviet states founded
the Commonwealth of Independent States and
large business partnerships came into effect.
While Russian share in Ukraine’s exports
declined from 26.2 percent in 1997 to around 23
percent in 1998-2000, the share of imports held
steady at 45-50 percent of the total. Overall,
between one third and one half of Ukraine’s
trade was with the Russian Federation.
Dependence was particularly strong in energy.
Up to 70-75 percent of annually consumed gas
and close to 80 percent of oil came from Russia.
On the export side, too, dependence was
significant. Russia remained Ukraine’s primary
market for ferrous metals, steel plate and pipes,
electric machinery, machine tools and
equipment, food, and products of chemical
industry. It has been a market of hope for
Ukraine’s high value-added goods, more than
nine tenths of which were historically tied to the
Russian consumer. Old buyers gone by 1997,
Ukraine had experienced a 97-99 percent drop
in production of industrial machines with digital
control systems, television sets, tape recorders,
excavators, cars and trucks. At the same time,
and in spite of the postcommunist slowdown,
Russia came out as the fourth-largest investor in
the Ukrainian economy after the USA,
Netherlands, and Germany, having contributed
$150.6 million out of $2.047 billion in foreign
direct investment that Ukraine had received
from all sources by 1998.
<br>
<br>
Although disputes prior to the Ukrainian
presidential election, 2004 were present
including the speculations regarding accidental
shooting down of a Russian airliner by the
Ukrainian military and the controversy with
the Tuzla Island, relations with Russia under
the latter years of Leonid Kuchma improved. In
2002 the Russian Government participated in
financing the construction of the Khmelnytsky
and the Rivne nuclear power plants. [17]
However, after the Orange Revolution several
problems resurfaced including a gas dispute,
and Ukraine's potential NATO membership.
The overall perception of relations with
Russia in Ukraine differs largely on regional
factors. Many Russophone eastern and southern
regions, which are also home to the majority of
the Russian diaspora in Ukraine welcome closer
relations with Russia. However further central
and particularly western regions (who were
never a part of Imperial Russia) of Ukraine
show a less friendly attitude to the idea of a
historic link to Russia and the Soviet Union in
particular.
<br>
<br>
In Russia, there is no regional breakdown
in the opinion of Ukraine, but on the whole,
Ukraine's recent attempts to joint
the EU and NATO were seen as change of course
to only a pro-Western, anti-Russian orientation
of Ukraine and thus a sign of hostility and this
resulted in a drop of Ukraine's perception in
Russia (although Ukrainian President Yushchenko
reassured Russia that joining NATO it is not
meant as an anti-Russian act. This was further
fuelled by the public discussion in Ukraine of
whether the Russian languageshould be given
official status and be made the second state
language. During the 2009 gas conflict the
Russian media almost uniformly portrayed
Ukraine as an aggressive and greedy state that
wanted to ally with Russia’s enemies and exploit
cheap Russian gas.
<br>
<br>
Further worsening relations were provoking
statements by both Russian and Ukrainian
politicians. The status of the Russian Black Sea
Fleet in Sevastopol remains a matter of
disagreement and tensions.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>Crimean Crisis</i></strong></div>

The Crimean peninsula, the main flashpoint
in Ukraine's crisis, is a pro-Russia part of
Ukraine, separated from the rest of the country
geographically, historically and politically. It
also hosts Russia's Black Sea Fleet. Ukraine has
accused Russia of invading it.
On 17 December 2013 Russian President
Vladimir Putin agreed to lend Ukraine 15 billion
dollars in financial aid and a 33% discount on
natural gas prices. The treaty was signed
amid massive, ongoing protests in Ukraine for
closer ties between Ukraine and the European
Union. Critics pointed out that in the months
before the 17 December 2013 deal a change in
Russian customs regulations on imports from
There are chemical processing plants and iron ore is mined in Kerch. Ukraine has two grain
terminals in Crimea - in Kerch and in Sevastopol. According to UkrAgroConsult, these have
exported 1.6 million tons of grain so far this season or 6.6 percent of Ukraine's total exports.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The black sea fleet</i></strong></div>

On Crimea's southern shore sits the port city of Sevastopol, home to the Russian Black Sea
Fleet and its thousands of naval personnel. Russia kept its half of the Soviet fleet, but was rattled
in 2009 when the pro-Western Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko warned that it would
have to leave the key port by 2017.
Shortly after pro-Russian Viktor Yanukovych was elected president in 2010, he agreed to
extend the Russian lease until 2042 in exchange for discounts on Russian gas supplies. Russia
fears that Ukraine's new pro-Western government could evict it.
Russia's Black Sea base in Sevastopol gives Moscow access to the Mediterranean. Ukraine's
fleet, carved out of the same Soviet fleet as Russia's, is also based there.

<div class="subheading"><strong><i>The Tatars</i></strong></div>

The 1991 fall of the Soviet Union also brought the return of the Crimean Tatars, the native
hosts of the land that fell to Russia under Catherine the Great in the 18th century. They were
brutally deported in 1944 under Stalin.
The Crimean Tatars, who now make up about 12 percent of its population, have sided
with the anti-Yanukovych protesters in Kiev who drove his government from power.
<br>
<br>
Ukraine was a Russian attempt to
prevent Ukraine to sign an Association
Agreement with the European Union.
The 2014 Crimean crisis is unfolding in the
autonomous region of Crimea, Ukraine, in the
aftermath of the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, in
which the government of President Viktor
Yanukovych was ousted. Protests were staged
by groups of mainly ethnic Russians who
opposed the events in Kiev and wanted close
ties or integration with Russia, in addition to
expanded autonomy or possible independence
for Crimea. Other groups, including Crimean
Tatars, protested in support of the revolution.
On 27 February, armed men wearing masks
seized a number of important buildings in
Crimea, including the parliament building and
two airports. They destroyed almost all phone
and internet service between Crimea and the
rest of Ukraine. Under siege, the Supreme
Council of Crimea dismissed the autonomous
republic's government and replaced chairman
of the Council of Ministers of Crimea, Anatolii
Mohyliov with Sergey Aksyonov. Kiev accused
Russia of intervening in Ukraine's internal affairs,
while the Russian side officially denied such
claims. On 1 March, the Russian parliament
granted President Vladimir Putin the authority
to use military force in Ukraine, following a plea
for help from unofficial pro-Moscow leader,
Sergey Aksyonov. On the same day, the acting
president of Ukraine, Oleksandr Turchynov
decreed the appointment of the Prime Minister
of Crimea as unconstitutional. He said, "We
consider the behavior of the Russian Federation
to be direct aggression against the sovereignty
of Ukraine!"
<br>
<br>
On 11 March, the Crimean parliament
voted and approved a declaration on the
independence of the Autonomous Republic of
Crimea and the city of Sevastopol from Ukraine,
as the Republic of Crimea, with 78 votes out of
100 in favor. Crimeans voted in a referendum
to rejoin Russia on 16 March. The Republic of
Crimea declared its independence from Ukraine
the next day, started seeking UN recognition,
and requested to join the Russian Federation. On
the same day, Russia recognized Crimea as a
sovereign state.
<br>
<br>
On March 27, the U.N. General Assembly
passed a non-binding Resolution 68/262 that
declared the Crimean referendum invalid and
the incorporation of Crimea into Russia illegal.
There has been huge opposition against Russian
move from US and its western allies. Russia
is also suspended from G8.
But with its intervention in Crimea, Russia
is sending a clear message to the US and its
western allies that the unipolar world order is
not viable anymore and the rules of engagement
have to be changed.
